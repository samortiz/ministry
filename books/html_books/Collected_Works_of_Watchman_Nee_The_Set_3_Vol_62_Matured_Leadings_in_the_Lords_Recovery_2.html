A church must find out what the pattern on the mountain is. It must take God's standard as its standard before it will realize how wrong it has been. What is the condition of the church that we are trying to match? Only as our eyes are drawn to the glorious church ordained by the Lord in the Scripture will we realize our shortage and lack.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reason for the Church's Failure</h2><p>The basic reason for the failure of the church is that it cannot meet its own need of begetting and nourishing the new ones. Changes in membership of a church should not come solely as a result of movement of saints to and from other localities. When a church is strong, the number of brothers and sisters moving out of the church is small. When a church is weak, the number of brothers and sisters moving out of the church is great. A businessman pays much attention to the influx and outflow of economic forces such as capital. A church also should pay much attention to the influx and outflow of its members. A church may have three to four hundred brothers and sisters, but it may be very short in care and shepherding. In a year's time, many new ones are added, but many old ones leave also. This is a drain on the church life. For this reason, a church must not only be good at preaching the gospel and gaining new ones, but must give itself to edifying the believers. The first responsibility of the church is to save men. The second responsibility is to perfect and nourish men. If a church saves a hundred people in a few months, yet loses a hundred at the same time, it is a total failure. This is the reason I say that a church's failure lies in its inability to keep the children it has begotten.</p><h2 class="head2">The Law of the Work of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>If a church is strong, it will be in full control of everything; it can dictate at will the number of sinners it saves. In order for the church to be strong, it has to work according to the pattern on the mountain, a pattern which the Lord revealed. If it does not work according to the Lord's pattern, it will be very hard to bring in men. But if the church works according to the Lord's pattern, it can tell itself to increase by five hundred, and it will increase by five hundred. Or it can tell itself to increase by a thousand, and it will increase by a thousand. If we take the Lord's way, it will not be a surprise to save three or five hundred people. It will not be a surprise to even save three or five thousand people. Some of our brothers call the Lord "the Son of Revival." Whether or not He is the Son of Revival depends on whether we work according to the law which He has revealed to us through the Holy Spirit. Those who know the law according to which the Lord works agree with my word. If the church knows the law of the Spirit and works according to this law in preaching the gospel, it will experience no obstacles in its saving work. Once the church rises to the standard, men are saved and revival comes.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Way of Revival&mdash;<br />the Whole Body Serving</h2><p>Some of us have been very much affected by Western missionaries and by the mission societies behind these missionaries. We think that God's way is through mission societies or foreign boards. But the Bible says nothing about mission societies and foreign boards. God only raises up churches. Mission societies, on the other hand, are raised up by men, in particular, by such men as A. J. Gordon. These men promote mission societies and foreign boards; they organize evangelistic institutions. Mission societies, foreign boards, and evangelistic institutions all look to a few men to spread the gospel. But God has only one way in the Bible; He only chooses one kind of people to preach the gospel&mdash;all the believers (Matt. 28:19). Everyone God has saved is a Christian, and every brother and sister He has given to the church has to be equally absolute in rejecting lust, sin, and the world. They must be equally given to preaching the gospel. God has not chosen a special class of people in the church to forsake everything for the gospel, while leaving the rest to do as they please. The church must not have two different classes of people, one being absolute in consecration while the other loves the world. There can only be one class of people in the church&mdash;those who are absolute in consecration. This is the way of revival that God is taking today. If the church is built up this way, the gates of Hades surely will not prevail against the church, and sinners surely will not be able to withstand it.</p><p>Our experience during the past few years has proven this. The result of the church preaching the gospel has been a multiple increase. In Taipei alone, the number has increased thirtyfold since last year. The rate of increase is measured by the number of folds, not by percentages. When the whole church rises up to serve, God's grace is more than we can hold. From north to south and from east to west, all the brothers and sisters have voluntarily offered up everything. We are not here to say that some should hand themselves over and others should not. We have no intention of drawing a line and dividing the saints into two classes of Christians. May the Lord find no hindrance in us, and may He find a way through the sinners. May the Lord not be hindered by worldly elements in the church, just as He is not hindered by sin in the sinners.</p><h2 class="head2">The Way to Meet the Need&mdash;<br />the Whole Body Handing Itself Over<br />to Be Perfected</h2><p>Today two kinds of work face the church&mdash;the work of begetting and the work of continual growth. In other words, it has to gain sinners on the one hand and edify the saints on the other hand.</p><p>Handing ourselves over does not merely mean handing over our possessions, but handing our very person over. The purpose of handing our possessions over is merely to allow the Lord to have a free way through us. If the Lord gives us a thousand people this year, will we be able to help these thousand pray, read the Bible, and break bread together? Unless we serve together as the Body, there is no way we can meet the need. Perhaps we have a shabby prayer meeting or a sloppy bread-breaking meeting. Those who should open their mouths do not, while those who should not open their mouths do. Everyone is unbridled in speaking. If this is the condition among us, how can we serve together? We must find the proper way to serve before we can integrate the new ones. This is the reason we must not only hand over our possessions, but our whole being for the service. This is the only way for God to have a way among us, and this is the only way for God to have a way among the sinners.</p><p>Let me illustrate. The church is like a big bakery. It "digests" raw flour and produces baked bread. The church must have enough capacity to "digest" a large amount of flour and roll it out again in the form of bread. The church must be able to absorb as many people as are added to it. It cannot solicit temporary help at the last minute. There are twice as many bakeries in Shanghai as in Hong Kong; this is the only way to meet the needs of the population. In the same way, the church must train and perfect enough people to serve to meet its need.</p><p>The church must not bring men to salvation only to lose them later. If it loses them, that is, if it saves a few one month and loses a few in the next few months, the total number will never increase, and the church will never be strong. In the church in Taipei, Brother Chang Yu-lan said that he is training the brothers and sisters until they can absorb everyone; if five thousand come, they will absorb five thousand. If fifty thousand come, they will absorb fifty thousand.</p><p>Perhaps some have joined our meetings for a few months but still do not know anything. We have not contacted them. I hope that after this fellowship we will make arrangements to take care of them immediately.</p><p>Fifteen or sixteen years ago, I gave a message in Shanghai on being anxious for nothing. I used an illustration of the roofers passing tiles from one person to another. Perhaps I can change the application of that illustration a little. Suppose a worker carries twenty tiles to the site. He passes these tiles one by one to a person halfway between the ground and the roof. The man on the roof then receives the tiles one by one from the one in the middle. The one in the middle has the ability to take as many as the one on the bottom passes to him. If the one at the bottom gives him five tiles, he can take all five because he passes them all on. If the one in the middle does not pass the tiles that he has received or if the one on top does not receive the tiles from the one in the middle, the middle one will be overburdened by the tiles. If the Lord has not started anything, we will not sense the urgency of the need to train the new ones. But as soon as the Lord starts something, and the church continues to gain some new ones, we will realize the urgent need to train these ones. As soon as new believers join the church, we have to train them and perfect them. We have to tell them what to do. Perhaps a person has joined us this month. In three or four months he needs to turn around and take care of the next group of new ones. In this way the church will care for new ones in an orderly way wave after wave. Those who are saved in January will take care of those who are saved in February. The Lord will bless the church; the church will grow, and it will also be able to absorb the result of its growth. This is the reason I have to shout, "The whole church has to hand itself over. It cannot delay!" Our possessions are only one among many things that we have to hand over. We do not make too much of material offering. Hopefully, you will not make too much of it either. Our hope is that everyone will hand himself over to be perfected and edified so that the whole Body can rise up to serve.</p><p>In the past, men conducted warfare on a one-on-one basis. It was guerrilla warfare. Today it is different. Warfare is a matter of total mobilization and joint operations. Paratroopers fight by dropping from the sky one by one, but they do not fight in an isolated way. Their thrust is part of a joint operation. Many times I have felt that the Western missionaries were engaged in guerrilla warfare when they went to inland China. Sometimes a couple would work in a place for thirty or forty years without gaining more than three or four people. They worked hard, and they were tireless. I admire them for their mind to suffer, but we cannot preach the gospel this way. It is not enough. Today in China we need migrations that move like paratroopers. We should use the seaports as centers to train our brothers, then send them group by group into the interior west of China. I believe when we respond to God's move this way, the gospelization of all of China will not be a problem.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING TRAINED AND WORKING IN COORDINATION<br />IN PREPARATION FOR MIGRATION</h2><p>The brothers and sisters who want to migrate must have special vocational skills. The church has to make arrangements in practical affairs related to the migration. All the brothers and sisters must first be trained. They must be trained in vocational skills, and they must be trained in preaching the gospel. An elephant in a circus may be clumsy at first, but after some training, it can dance and perform.</p><p>We hope that the brothers and sisters will practice coordination in their occupation as well. We hope that all their occupations will be for the gospel. They should coordinate together in their business so that they can make more money for migration and the spreading of the gospel. Students who are studying at school should also coordinate together. I hope that they will learn some lessons now for the gospel's sake so that in the future they can support themselves in a migration. Some of the applicants for migration to Yi-Yang have good educations and high spiritual capacities, but we cannot use them. However, we can use concrete workers. If we have good education but cannot support ourselves, we will present a problem to the migration. A concrete worker can support himself; therefore, he is useful to the migration.</p><p>In order to prepare ourselves for migration, we have to do a few things. First, brothers and sisters who have a burden to migrate for the spread of the gospel must have a practical skill. We may think that such training is very troublesome, but we have to remember the Lord's word that it is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35). We have to learn to be those who give. We have to learn to work with our own hands, not only to support ourselves but to support others as well. Second, the brothers and sisters must learn to do things properly. If we can do things properly here in Hong Kong, we can do things properly in Chungking. We have to be trained by the church in the way we handle things. We have to learn the secret of preaching the gospel effectively and leading men to salvation effectively. Third, we in the church have to learn to know the Bible. Through the brothers' and sisters' handing themselves over, we have turned the whole church into a school or a clinic; we will give practical training on how to diagnose people. I hope those who have heard this word before will become more and more clear of our way. This is the only way for the gospel to go out.</p><p>From now on, all trainings, including trainings in the gospel, business affairs, and the study of the Bible, are under the leadership of Brother Witness. We cannot live a leisurely and lazy life any longer. Unless some are unable to catch up physically, we want everyone to be on the alert, to busy himself, to gird up, and to catch up. May the church in Hong Kong be like the army of God, a church that moves in military steps (cf. Num. 1&mdash;2). May the Lord be gracious to us.</p><h2 class="head1">A FELLOWSHIP ON THE WORK IN TAIWAN</h2><p>Witness Lee: For almost half a year, I have stayed in Taiwan. Ninety percent of the brothers and sisters who were saved during the past half year had never heard the gospel before and had never touched Christianity. Presently, twelve hundred people have been saved. But one problem with these newly saved ones is that they still do not know the ground and the way of service.</p><p>In Kaoshiung there are over three hundred brothers and sisters. Last year only a few dozen were breaking bread there. There are no so-called workers in Kaoshiung; every brother and sister has a job. They are all quite busy. But the number of saved ones swarms in like a flood because everyone puts in his portion and is trained. In gospel meetings during the past Chinese New Year, over six hundred people received the Lord and left their names. All the brothers and sisters are young.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING THE WAY OF THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><h2 class="head2">Returning to the Condition of the Early Church</h2><p>How long has the church been on the earth? Almost two thousand years. Has it passed through many places? We can say it has reached almost the entire world. How many people has it touched? Millions. After having been on earth for so long, passing through so many places and touching so many people, do you not think that the church has changed from its original state? In buying things, we want to buy them factory-made in an unaltered state. Do you realize that the church today is something that has been altered from its original state? If you buy a garment, do you want one that is unaltered or one that has been altered? Everyone wants an unaltered one. Unless we have the thought that the church has not been altered, we all should want to go back to the church in its original state. During the past two thousand years, the church has degraded. The church that we see today is no longer the same as the church at the beginning. Today our ground is the ground of recovery; we cannot be ignorant of this fact. The more questions we ask, the better. No matter from what angle we view Christianity, can we say that it is the same as the original church? We must remember that we do not save men to bring them into Christianity. If we only bring them to Christianity, there is a problem with our work. Hence, we should have as many questions as possible. Once we ask questions, we will take the way of God's recovery.</p><p>Since 1940, or perhaps 1939, the high point of God's recovery work in the church has been the raising up of the whole Body in His service. Not only do we see this truth in the Bible, but we also have this sense in our spirit. The entire assembly hands itself over to be trained and then to be sent out group by group in migration. This will afford God the opportunity to take a quick way among us. For five or six years, I was under the trial of illness as well as under pressure in the environment and opposition from men. All of these taught me precious lessons in life. According to the sense I received in my spirit during my time of fellowshipping with the Lord, I was clear that I have to train the saints to know coordination outwardly and to be perfected in life inwardly. Locally we have to preach the gospel, and extra-locally we have to move through migration. These are very crucial principles.</p><h2 class="head2">Satisfying the Demand of the Saints' Spirits</h2><p>We know the general principles above, but where do we start? We have to start with the small things. We can consider two angles. A church in a locality has to satisfy the inner demand of its own brothers and sisters internally, and it must also satisfy the need of outsiders externally. If we cannot meet the inner need of the brothers and sisters, we have a problem. Every brother and sister should be able to touch a supply when they come into the church life. If the church cannot supply them, something is wrong. We may not have anything wrong outwardly, but as long as we cannot satisfy the inner needs of the brothers and sisters, something is wrong with us. In every generation God bestows grace differently. What we see, taste, and hear today are things that men of former generations have never seen, tasted, or heard. For this we have to worship God with grateful tears. He has been too gracious to us. He has shown us these things. He has chosen to reveal these to us among all the people for the purpose of encouraging us to go to Him to take His way. The inner urge of the brothers and sisters is a sure sign that God is taking the way of recovery quickly. It is precious that they have this feeling. Presently, we see this happening in Tsingtao, Chefoo, Peking, and Shanghai.</p><p>For this very reason, I was forced to look to the Lord, because I realized that all of us are not fully captured by Him yet. Individually, we have not allowed God to get through in us completely. So many brothers and sisters in the church have this demand and urge within them, yet we cannot meet their need. I feel that we have to bear the responsibility of this entire matter before the Lord. Unless we take up this matter seriously, universal service and migration will be nothing but theories.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Body Handing Itself Over<br />to Answer God's Demand</h2><p>If one individual among all the brothers and sisters will not answer God's call and go forward, God cannot go on with the whole, and He cannot get through in the church. In this age God is taking the quick way, the way of recovery. The least He can ask of the church is for the entire Body to rise up, migrate, and spread the gospel. Whether or not God can get through depends on us. God's servant has released His speaking and His light, and the brothers and sisters have sensed this inner urge and need within them. But nothing will happen without our cooperation. Hence, the first thing that we have to do is hand ourselves over. Our very person as well as our possessions have to be offered up to answer God's call.</p><p>Handing over is not something that just involves material offerings; it does not refer just to money. It refers to our very person. If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over and coordinates together as a Body, there will be no problem with our training. I was not too clear about this matter of coordination and training back in 1940-43. Today I see this clearly; we need coordination in everything and in every aspect. We need training in everything and in every area. Last night when I arrived, I sat at the back. I realized that there must be coordination not only in the preaching of the gospel and in consecration, but even in the choice of our occupation. To hand ourselves over means that we hand ourselves and our possessions over to meet God's demand on the one hand and that we give ourselves to the church, accept the arrangement of the church, and give ourselves to coordination and training on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Arrangements of the Church<br />and Offering Ourselves to Be Trained</h2><p>In the past it seems that we put too much so-called "trust" in the Holy Spirit and not enough trust in the church. In the past we always said that we would leave it to the Holy Spirit to do the work. Today we are not telling the saints to no longer trust in the leading of the Spirit; rather, we are telling the saints to trust in the leading of the Body. During the past ten or more years, we have witnessed so many questionable so-called leadings of the Spirit. Today it is more sure to give ourselves to the Body and to receive the leading of the Body.</p><p>Once we hand ourselves over, we will realize that we need training in everything and in every aspect. We need training even in the way we conduct our prayer meeting. In the beginning we may come together to pray, but in the end, we may find ourselves criticizing each other. One may say that someone is too wordy. Another may say that the first one is too much in the mind. Still a third may say that others are not addressing God in the right way, etc. Once we hand ourselves over, the self has to go. No one whose self is intact can coordinate and serve in the church life. If the self remains, it is hard to have the whole Body rise up to serve. We all have to learn to take the breaking which the Lord applies to the self through the church. Many of us have been seeking and struggling to break the self for many years but have not been successful. The self is still not broken. Once we place ourselves in the church and take the dealings from the Body, we will get through easily; the self will go away effortlessly. We will not only be properly equipped in function, but we will be practically perfected in our spiritual life. We should never recoil from offering or giving ourselves to the training through fear of making mistakes. If we make a mistake it will only be a mistake in our behavior; in our spirit we will still be perfected. I hope we all will give ourselves to be trained, to be dealt with, and to learn the lessons.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE CHARACTER AND WORK<br />OF THE ELDERS<br />AND THE WAY TO SERVE TODAY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Saturday morning, February 18, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><p>Watchman Nee: The term elder refers to what a man is before the Lord, and the term overseer refers to what he does. For this reason, an elder should not be involved in any work in a direct way. Rather, he should strive to know God's will, and then assign work to the brothers and sisters accordingly. He should spend more time leading and helping the brothers and sisters to do the work. The elders should not replace the saints' work but should supervise them in the work. Hence, the first thing the elders have to learn is to know God's will. If too much work is kept in your hand, you have failed as far as being an elder is concerned. Your responsibility lies mainly in knowing God's will and in assigning the work to others one by one. You have to be busy in overseeing others.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHARACTER AND WORK OF AN ELDER</h2><p>Witness Lee: I would like to speak a little from my experience concerning the character and work of an elder.</p><h2 class="head2">Having the Heart of a Father</h2><p>First, the elders have to have a fatherly heart. At least they have to have the heart of a big brother. A father is very protective of his son, and a big brother always jealously guards his younger brother. God's requirement for the elders is more than His requirement for fathers and big brothers. It is not enough for the elders to do things right. Perhaps the elders make mistakes. They may come short in many things. Perhaps we can even say that they may fail, but they must have a fatherly heart before they will bring in the Lord's blessing. If the elders have the heart of a father, they will help the brothers and sisters go through many trials and crises.</p><p>Many problems cannot be solved by spiritual insight, scriptural teaching, or spiritual power alone. We are not saying that scriptural light and spiritual power are useless. Suppose two brothers are having a problem with each other. If you have spiritual insight, you will know whom you should tell to learn to exercise righteousness and whom you should tell to learn to bear the cross and accept the breaking. You may even have the spiritual power to bring them under the judgment of light. But you still must have the heart of a father before they will submit themselves to this judgment. You may have the power to shame them, but you will not have the ability to soften them. They will only soften before a fatherly heart, and only then will they break into tears and see and confess their mistakes. If the elders have the heart of a father, it will be easy to solve the problems of the brothers and sisters. The church is the family of God. As such, some brothers must represent God as the fathers. They are mature in spiritual life, well-grounded in experience, and full of care and compassion. This will give the brothers and sisters the impression that we have fathers and big brothers among us, and that some in the Lord are caring for them.</p><p>I have known Brother Chao Ching-hwai for over twenty years. We have been in the Lord's way together for over eighteen years. He has many virtues, but the most striking one is that he has a fatherly heart. He is very concerned about the marriages of the brothers and sisters, more so than for his own children. I have never seen anyone like him in caring for the marriages of the saints. The problems of many brothers and sisters cannot be solved by messages from the podium, but they are solved as soon as they are presented before him. He exercises tender care towards the brothers and sisters. Sometimes he rebukes them in a strong way, but the brothers do not feel hurt or offended. Rather, they are comforted. If you have the heart of a father, even your rebuke is sweet. We have to look to God for this grace.</p><p>The elders in Taipei asked me how they could have the heart of a father. There are things to consider on God's side and there are things to consider on man's side. On God's side, it is His love and mercy to the church when He gives the elders the heart of a father. On our side, once we see that God has placed us in the position of an elder, we have to go to Him, open our hearts to Him, and receive grace from Him. We must then exercise ourselves to have the same heart that God has&mdash;the heart of a father. If we exercise this heart, we will have a caring concern for a brother as soon as we see him. Some doctors say that the more a person exercises a part of his body, the stronger that part becomes. The same can be said about a caring heart. We have to be like a boxer, who is ever ready to strike his blow wherever he goes. If we exercise ourselves to have such a fatherly heart, all the brothers and sisters will love to come to us. We have to know that every child of God has a keen sense and registration within his spirit. If an elder does not have such a fatherly heart, it will be easy for him to close his door to the brothers and sisters. As soon as he closes himself, he becomes a great failure to the church. The elders have to be so exercised in this matter that the saints can share with them what they will not share with their parents and friends. They will even reveal many secrets they have before the Lord. Our heart has to be in intimate fellowship with the hearts of the brothers and sisters; their spirits have to be joined to our spirit. If the elders cannot do this, they will leave a big gap in the church life. This will be the greatest shortage, failure, and lack.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being Afraid of Troubles</h2><p>Second, the elders must not be afraid of troubles. For example, the matter of hospitality is the most troublesome work, especially when it comes to taking care of troublesome guests. The elders must not be afraid of such troubles. In fact, they have to love such troubles. The book of 1 Timothy speaks of the qualifications of an elder, one of which is to be the husband of one woman (3:2a). This means not marrying more than one woman, which implies temperance and self-control. Another qualification of an elder is to be hospitable (v. 2b). Being single in marriage is being restricted in oneself, and being hospitable is being happy to take up others' troubles. On the one hand, the elders have to restrict themselves. On the other hand, they have to love to take up others' troubles. Receiving guests is a test from God. It shows whether or not we are afraid of troubles. We must not be afraid of troubles but must welcome them instead. We must continually ask ourselves, "Why has no one troubled me today?" We have to rejoice when troubles come. If we raise even an eyebrow, we are posting a "No Visitors" sign before the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Coordination is a kind of blending, like the blending of mortar with water for plastering walls. The more the brothers and sisters are blended together, the better it is. It is a rare thing for two brothers to coordinate together without arguing with each other. Once there is a relationship, there is an argument. However, the argument affords a chance for the two to be blended together. It is a matter of whether or not the elders can harmonize in the midst of an argument. A good elder can turn an argument into a wonderful harmony. Therefore, an elder must have piles and piles of things to do every day. He must love to have people come to him, ask him questions, and give him troubles.</p><p>In Shanghai there is a Shin-Tah-Shiang fabric store on Nanking Road. When you walk in, everything seems to be in a mess. Other stores are neat and tidy, but they are good only for the window-shoppers. Actually, that fabric store is not messy at all. It is too busy making money. It has too many things to do and does not have the time to put everything in order. Its business is so good that it has opened up a branch in Nanking. Success is often judged by the small things, not the big things. A place like Hong Kong should find its elders extremely busy.</p><h2 class="head2">Knowing God's Will</h2><p>The elders should go to God on behalf of the church and inquire of His will. By definition, a business is an endeavor that is busy with ideas. In order for a business to prosper, a manager has to be very busy in his thoughts; he has to know the market and the needs of his customers clearly. The elders have to be rich enough in their mind to receive guidance from God. If they cannot receive guidance from God, how can the many brothers and sisters under them prosper in the work? The elders have to find a way before God when no way seems to be in sight. In order for the elders to know God's will and receive leadings, they have to bring the affairs of the church to the Lord all the time. They have to bear the brothers and sisters before the Lord and look to Him for light. This is not a matter of man waiting for God, but of God waiting for man. As long as a man's heart is open, God will show him "the pattern on the mountain."</p><p>In order to be a good Christian, we must be able to read three things. We must be able to read the operation of the Holy Spirit within the saints, we must be able to read the Bible, and we must be able to read the environment, including people, affairs, and things. In addition to reading the above three things, a good elder must be able to read the condition of the brothers and sisters, in particular their inward condition. In the Old Testament the high priest had authority to put on the ephod. Two shoulder straps and a breastplate were attached to the ephod. On the two shoulder straps, there were two sapphires engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. The breastplate rested in the middle of the ephod and contained twelve stones containing the engraved names of the twelve tribes of Israel. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel represented the whole people of God. Whenever the high priest went to God, he bore upon his shoulders and embraced in his bosom the whole people of God. He inquired of God and sought His counsel. God revealed His will according to the Urim and Thummin in the breastplate. Urim in Hebrew means "light"; it is a kind of illuminator. It was placed under the twelve stones. Thummin in Hebrew means "perfection." The names of the twelve tribes of Israel contain eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The remaining four letters are contained in the Thummin. In this way, the breastplate had all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew language. Through the shining of the Urim, God's will was spelled out.</p><p>The elders have to carry the condition of the brothers and sisters to God all the time and inquire of Him. They have to receive clear judgments and instructions concerning them. We cannot expect to receive any revelation from God if we do not know anything about the condition of the brothers and sisters. The elders must see "the pattern on the mountain" on the one hand and consider the condition of the saints through the shining in God's dwelling&mdash;the Holy of Holies&mdash;on the other hand. All the elders have to know God's will for the church in Hong Kong today, the way He wants the church to take, the things He wants the church to do, and what He requires of the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head2">Caring for the Inward Need<br />of the Brothers and Sisters</h2><p>The elders must not neglect the inward need of any brother or sister in the church. The saints have inward needs, and the church cannot ignore these needs. It has to take care of these needs immediately. In addition to the light which God has shown us through His servants, we have to pay attention to the spiritual needs within the brothers and sisters, because all these needs speak of God's work within them. If the elders ignore these needs, they are ignoring the heavenly vision and will receive severe chastisement (cf. Amos 2:11-12).</p><p>The elders have to be more sensitive and perceptive to the feelings of the brothers and sisters. God often grants us stronger lights through the brothers and sisters. For this reason, the elders have to care for the needs of the saints as much as they care for their own needs. If they do this, they will not offend the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The elders must open up their hearts all the time. They should bear the saints on their shoulders and upon their hearts, inquiring of God on their behalf. (The breast has to do with the heart, and the shoulders have to do with strength.) We have to give our heart and strength to the brothers and sisters. We should bring them to God and seek for light this way. When they have a burden from the Holy Spirit, we should not annul this burden. When the elders hear that a young person has a burden for the gospel or a desire to do something, they should immediately bring the matter to God and inquire of Him concerning such a desire. We do not know how much we have limited God today. He is waiting for us. It is not we who are waiting for God. I hope that the elders will take heed to all the flock (Acts 20:28).</p><h2 class="head2">Making Proper Arrangements for Practical Affairs</h2><p>The elders must not only bear the responsibility for the spiritual service of the entire church before God but must bear the responsibility for the practical affairs as well. For this reason, the elders must be able to make good and proper arrangements of all the practical affairs. They must realize that practical affairs can be a great means for God to accomplish His work or a great hindrance to frustrate His work. The more works there are and the heavier the responsibility of the work is, the more there is the need for proper arrangements. This is like riding a car through hills and valleys; one passes over hill after hill to reach his destination. The car can be a means or a hindrance. If the elders control the car well, God's work will move speedily forward, and it will reach its destination.</p><p>Today in Christianity, an organization may have three thousand, ten thousand, even twenty thousand names on its roll, but only three to five hundred actively serve. Few people participate practically in the services. The general number of the church can increase, but if the serving ones do not increase in number, the church will soon reach its maximum capacity. It will be unable to grow any further. If the water from a big river is channeled toward a hundred gallon barrel, it can only hold that much water. The rest will drain away and be wasted.</p><p>Arrangements of practical affairs increase our capacity for God's grace. The more arrangements the elders make with regards to practical affairs and personnel assignments, the more opportunity they will provide God to work among them. Some may say that the elders should at most only make arrangements in services, in spiritual directions, and in prayer, but not in personnel assignments. Actually, personnel assignments are more important than the arrangement of practical affairs. God's work is carried out mainly through human beings. This is the reason the elders must perfect men and train these men to handle affairs properly.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Thorough in the Management of Affairs</h2><p>The elders must not only make arrangements of practical affairs but must be thorough in managing these affairs. As a responsible brother, your mind and concepts have to be clear and quick. Some people are too spiritual in their thoughts. They think that as long as they pray for the saints, it matters little how they arrange the chairs. This is absolutely wrong. The elders must be quick to turn. We are not yet living in the New Jerusalem. There are still many things that need to be done in the church life. These things need to be done properly. The more thorough and complete the execution, the better off we are. Many times the elders come up with an idea; this idea calls things not being into being. I can testify that I bother people all the time; I am a bad man to many. You have to come up with something to do even when there is nothing to do, and you have to demand that these things be done thoroughly. Those who cannot handle things properly cannot expect to work for God. Do not think that you can work for God simply by giving a few messages. That is very far from the goal.</p><p>Those who cannot manage things cannot work for God. Only those who can manage can work for Him. Those who are sloppy in managing affairs are sloppy and inaccurate in studying the Bible. If you are not accurate in the way you arrange chairs, you will be inaccurate in the way you expound the Bible. Brother Chang Yu-lan rebukes people to their face many times. He is good at finding faults in others. If you tell him that your mistake matters little, he will tell you that it only matters little if you are the only one in the world that is serving. You have to consider how many people are following behind you and how many brothers and sisters are looking at you. Perhaps a little mistake on your part will cause five hundred souls to be kept away from salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO SERVE TODAY&mdash;THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><h2 class="head2">The Brothers and Sisters<br />Handing Themselves Over and<br />the Elders Making Proper Arrangements</h2><p>Hong Kong is a big place; it needs a strong church to carry out the proper service. Recently I saw an Assembly of God Church preaching the gospel. There were not very many people in the meeting. Very close by there was a cinema packed with people. The Assembly of God Church had few people in comparison with the cinema. Hong Kong does not need a strong gospel giant, but it does need a strong church to rise up to preach the gospel. The whole Body has to rise up to serve. If the whole church rises up to preach the gospel, I believe the number in Hong Kong would increase to two thousand in half a year. In order for the whole church to rise up to serve, all the saints have to hand themselves over. After they have handed themselves over, they have to accept the arrangement of the leading elders. When all the building materials are ready, you can mobilize different departments to begin the building work.</p><p>The elders have to make a list of everything that has been handed over, including the people, things, and work. They have to make a list of personnel and match the work and personnel together. They have to find a practical way to carry out every matter. Once the work is clear, the personnel set, and the way finalized, they can proceed with the actual decisions. In carrying out the works, the elders have to exercise strict oversight. They have to set deadlines and standards. They have to decide how good a work needs to be and when it must be finished. If the elders can carry out these few things, mistakes and flaws will be minimized. If they do not know how to do something the first time, they should still try and look for a way. After they find the way, they will discover the law to doing that thing.</p><p>The way of the church is different from the way of the missionaries; it is the way of the whole Body serving. We all have a living physical body. This body works, lives, rests, and eats spontaneously. The service of the church is a Body service. It is natural and normal for it to save men and perfect them all the time. Perhaps one day you will see the church not only as a home to nurture people but as a school to train people, a factory to produce people, and a hospital to heal people. If the brothers will spend a little more time to fellowship and pray together, there will be good arrangements. Without proper arrangements, there will be setbacks, and it will be difficult to have a revival.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church Being<br />a Matter of the Entire Body Serving</h2><p>Watchman Nee: I do not want to add anything to Brother Lee's speaking for fear of diluting his words.</p><p>In the past all the churches tried to invite gifted co-workers to work, preach the gospel, and edify their saints. But I would ask a question: What is the church? The church is where everyone rises up to serve. The church is not just a few people like Witness Lee, Watchman Nee, and Peace Wang. Only when the entire Body rises up is there the church. The church is the Body of Christ, and everyone is useful. We should never think that we have the church as long as we have a wooden table to conduct the Lord's table or that we have the church as long as we have a few strong members. The church involves all the material, that is, all the one-talented ones coming together to serve. Not everyone has to be like Brother Lee before he can be a piece of material. The church is not a conglomeration of five-talented ones; it is not a corporation of two-talented ones. It is a Body composed mainly of one-talented ones. When men like you and I come together to serve, we have the church. When all the one-talented ones are coordinated together, that will be a potent force. Only by serving this way will we have a strong church.</p><p>You should not put your hope on better and stronger ones coming to join you. You can gospelize the place where you are with the number you have now. In a strong church a great evangelist would be treated just like one of the brothers. Suppose there is a church with two or three hundred people. There may not be any five-talented and two-talented ones. Perhaps all the saints are one-talented ones. You may think that something is lacking, but if all these so-called "untalented" ones would coordinate together, God would have a way to go on. Never think that you are too short. A person like yourself is more than qualified. I believe that the age of giants is over in the church life. Perhaps in the next generation, the so-called "giants" that we have now will disappear altogether. Today is the end time for giants. What God wants today is the service of the whole Body. Today God forbids any member from becoming too strong. What He wants is a strong church.</p><p>In the past when I read the Bible, I had strong doubts whether Ephesians 4 would ever be fulfilled. I was foolish to worry and be anxious for God. During the past few years, I have begun to feel that it is possible to fulfill Ephesians 4. Today God is doing the work of recovering the Body testimony. The gifts that He has given are for the perfecting of the saints for the ministry. One or two specially gifted workers no longer can fulfill the task; all the brothers and sisters can preach the gospel, heal the sick, edify the saints, and save the lost. The church can beget, be established, be trusted upon, be revived, and rise up to serve. It will be built up like the New Jerusalem and be strong.</p><p>I have never been satisfied in the matter of the whole Body serving. The church is short in everything. But one day something glorious will emerge. Our way is becoming more and more clear. Of course, our troubles will be more and more numerous. In 1939 we gathered together over thirty deacons in Shanghai and set up the deacons' office in the meeting hall. We began to have a structure or form for our service. No other place practices this yet. At that time we found in every place one man speaking and a few serving. In Shanghai we began to have over thirty people taking "shifts" in the deacons' office. Later Shanghai had some problems of its own. In 1940 the Lord continued this work in Chefoo. Although I was quiet outwardly, inwardly I kept praying. I was greatly encouraged when I saw that God worked in exactly the same way as He had spoken.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Requirement Being<br />for the Whole Body to Serve</h2><p>What I saw in 1949 was much more than what I saw in 1939. I saw that God intends for the church to become a solid and sure Body, an institution that brings salvation to men, and an entity that fights, edifies, and heals. Today the age of monumental achievements by great giants is over. God wants the whole church to rise up to serve. Today the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over to be material for the building. The elders and responsible brothers have to rise up to learn to make arrangements, to take the lead, and to build. This will make the church the multifarious serving Body to the Lord. Once this is in place, the church will be able to absorb five thousand or even ten thousand new ones. The Lord intends that each church in each locality bear the burden of the gospel as well as meet the need of the saints.</p><p>What do we mean by spiritual needs? It is the need the brothers and sisters sense within themselves when they rise up to serve the Lord. A church should never allow a brother to have this need before the Lord yet not satisfy his need. If a man is sick, you have to give him medicine, not food. If a man is without food, you have to feed him, not give him medicine. What is the church? The church is where the genuine need within the spirit of every brother and sister is truly met. The elders have to consider all the time. They have to bring the whole church to God. They have to bear all the brothers and sisters upon their shoulders and lead them to the Lord.</p><p>Today our goal is for the whole Body to serve. God's demand is great. He requires that we forsake everything to serve Him. Is there an organization on earth in which one is required to forsake everything and to sell all before he can join? Only the church requires a membership fee that comprises one's total possessions! This is an uncompromising demand. If we accept this uncompromising demand, and if we are willing to come forward and act upon it uncompromisingly, we will see uncompromising results.</p><p>In this universal service, everyone is active and aggressive. If only one person is passive, we do not have the church. Whether or not God's will is done rests entirely in our hands. Blessed are those who see and hear this word. If we see all these points clearly, we are most blessed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Saturday afternoon, February 18, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">THREE CRUCIAL FACTORS IN THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2><h2 class="head2">Things</h2><p>Watchman Nee: The worst thing that an elder or deacon can do in the church is to reduce a big thing to a small one and then make a small thing nothing at all. If they take this attitude, there will be no service in the church. The first crucial factor in service is to find things to do.</p><h2 class="head2">People</h2><p>Once we create things to do, there is the need to find people to do the things. If the things remain in our hand, the church will not be strong. In order for the church to be strong, the number of serving ones has to be great. The strongest church is one where the entire Body serves. The elders and deacons have to be good at searching out men and perfecting them. In the past we were afraid of people volunteering, suggesting, and acting in a disorderly way. Now we do not have to be afraid; we can deal with them and perfect them with the proper authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Method</h2><p>After we have things and people lined up, we need to find the method or the way. We will do something right only if we have the right way. If we do things impulsively and whimsically according to our own ideas, we will not get the right results. We are most afraid of people exercising their own thoughts and coming up with many ways in their mind. One person does something according to his own preference, while another person does something else according to his own preference. We are afraid of people acting impulsively without giving any thought to what they are doing and without seeking the Lord adequately. Having the right people is not the whole story; we must also find the right way before the Lord. Never act or work in a foolish way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHARACTER AND WORK OF THE DEACONS</h2><p>Witness Lee: I would still like to fellowship a little from my experience about the character and work of the deacons. The responsibility of receiving leadings from God for the entire church rests on the elders. They have to lead the church to the knowledge of God's will. The execution of this will, however, rests on the shoulders of the deacons. If a church only has strong elders but not strong deacons, its service will not be proper. Hence, the deacons occupy a very important place.</p><p>When the Lord comes back, a group of overcomers will take the lead to reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). Our exercise and training today is very much related to our reigning tomorrow. Today God is training a group of people so that they can rule in the kingdom in the future. Our exercise and training are not just for today but for the future. Today we are in school; the application will be our service in eternity future. In the coming kingdom the Lord will assign us greater works. The work in God's house will continue. We will not be idle in the coming age (Matt. 25:21; Luke 19:17). Therefore, we cannot be satisfied merely with getting things done. We must take care of a few points.</p><h2 class="head2">Building Up Character</h2><p>The first thing the deacons should pay attention to is to be dealt with by God in their very person; they have to build up a proper character. How much have you, the person, been dealt with in the hand of God? It is not a matter of finishing a job or of getting things done. You have to be dealt with and trained by God. It is more important to be properly trained by God than to get things done and finished. Deacons everywhere often fail to realize this point: The person is more important than the work. Often the work is completed but the person is damaged. It would be wonderful if both the work and the person were preserved, but if you cannot preserve both, it is better to sacrifice the work than the person. You must always remember that your service is for building up your character. God does not care as much for the success of the work as He does for the training and dealing we receive from Him in the process of doing the work. His ultimate goal is to succeed not only in the work but also in the perfecting of a group of people through doing this work. A young church often has deacons and elders who do not know what they should do. Sometimes things are done, but the character of the persons is not built up, and God is not fully satisfied. I hope that the church in Hong Kong will mature. I hope it will not only get some work done but also perfect a group of people with the proper character. In other words, you must be built up as a person.</p><p>A doctor may start in his profession as a junior physician but will later mature to become a renowned doctor. His very look will give people the impression of a mature professional. Even a stranger can tell that he is a medical doctor. While he is skillful in healing his patients, being successful in his work, more importantly, he has developed the character of a physician in his very being.</p><h2 class="head2">Exercising to Find the Spiritual Way</h2><p>Deacons should not adopt any worldly views in their work; rather, they should have spiritual insight. In handling of practical affairs, they should look for the spiritual way. You may be making a chair. The work is physical, but you should have spiritual insight in your work. Some people manage international enterprises, but they do not know God at all. In managing church affairs, our aim is to know God through the process of our training. The goal is to touch God and to grow in our spiritual insight.</p><p>For example, the church may assign you to take care of transportation for visitors. Your view may be absolutely worldly, viewing it as a social function. The assignment may be carried out properly, but there is no spiritual value in the work and no spiritual exercise in the process. Transportation is not a spiritual work, but we should make others sense something spiritual, heavenly, and sweet in our transportation. Personally, I feel that this is a crucial test. We are required not only to exercise our wisdom and ability; we are also tested as to how strong our fellowship and communion are with God and how thorough and intimate our prayer is before Him. There is a place for our wisdom and our method, but the greatest test involves whether or not we live before the Lord. If we do not put all the things we are doing before the Lord, the things we do will carry the flavor of this world. If we do everything in the presence of the Lord, our actions will be heavenly, and we will bear a heavenly taste.</p><p>We have to charge all the brothers and sisters to live before the Lord all the time. We have to carry our burden to God. We must acquire some experience of intimate and sweet fellowship with the Lord. We should be like David, who sat before the Lord and who fellowshipped with Him in an intimate way (2 Sam. 7:18). Before we are about to do anything, we should sit in our room and talk with God face to face about it. We can present the matter to Him and ask, "Is it right for me to do this? Should I do it?" When we do this, we will receive God's revelation, and we will be clear whether or not we are acting according to His good pleasure. God will show us if we are too much in one area or not enough in another area. If we can do this, we will touch God's heart even in a small thing like hospitality. We should never give people the impression that the church is just a social club, a charitable organization, or a social gathering. As soon as others touch the church they should sense something heavenly and touch its heavenly nature.</p><p>The YMCA has hostels; it treats its guests quite well. But the church should convey a feeling that heaven is here. It should draw a line between what is worldly and what is spiritual. The difference lies in whether or not the person doing the work is living in the heavenly and spiritual realm. If we fellowship with God and through such fellowship offer our ability and power to God, spontaneously the work we do will bear the glow and taste of heaven. We will not toss the matter back and forth between human hands but will inquire of God as to how the matter should be handled. If we develop this habit, we will know God's will as soon as we put our hand to a work. Spontaneously, we will not work according to our disposition but according to God's disposition. We work for the purpose of building up our character in the service. It is for the purpose of establishing and maintaining our spirituality.</p><p>Consider the example of cleaning the meeting hall. On the first day of January, I saw the brothers expressing their love for the church in coming to clean the meeting hall. But what is the use of such work if all we accomplish is cleaning? Does not a family or a company make their place spotless when they have their annual cleanup? If the brothers and sisters, however, pray and fellowship before they clean, this will make a difference in the spiritual flavor. Not only will the meeting hall be clean, but the brothers and sisters will wash each others' feet. The same can be said of leading men to Christ. If we are short in spiritual stature, the quality of our work will be poor even if we save eight hundred or a thousand people. No white parents give birth to yellow babies; rather, it is "like father, like son." In order to train people of quality and spiritual weight, we ourselves must go through training and learn our lessons first.</p><h2 class="head2">Breaking the Self</h2><p>The best way for the deacons to deal with the self is through handling business affairs in the church. A deacon experiences the greatest dealing in his self and his flesh; through the service, the self receives the most merciless breaking. The church is the best place for the self to be broken. Some people have said that the family and marriage are the best means of breaking the self. Actually, these things do not break the self that much. When we are with our own children, we are in control of everything. But in order to serve as a deacon and fulfill our duty, we have to hand ourselves over; we cannot do as we please. If we have an opinion concerning a matter, we cannot be silent about it. We may think that it is polite to retreat and keep quiet, but if we do this, our spiritual life will come to a standstill. If we do not behave politely, however, we will clash with the brothers and sisters. Problems only arise because our self is not yet broken. From the day we accepted our assignment as a deacon, we have to be ready to take the "suicide" way; we have to be ready to sacrifice the self on the deacon's altar.</p><p>God's requirement for the deacons is that they not hold on to any opinion, idea, or feeling of their own. They should only know to obey God's leading in a simple way. This is a very severe demand. Please consider if there is any group of people on earth who is without any opinion or feeling. If you want to be a deacon, you have to make up your mind the first day to put the self in God's hand. You have to learn to humble yourself, to come under, and to reject all self opinion.</p><p>The problem of the deacons is with their very own person; the problem is not with others. If you will not answer His call and take the lesson of the breaking of the self, you may become a deacon on February 18, but I guarantee that you will quit by March 18. If you make up your mind to answer the Lord's demand from this point onward, you will not have any problem with your assignment. Once you are willing to accept the breaking, you will not have any problem. If you do not have the self, how can you have any problem with the other brothers and sisters?</p><p>Let me tell you a story. In 1936 I was working and living in a certain place. Almost every month I had to travel twice to another locality to settle disputes arising from service in the church. All the brothers loved the Lord very much, and all of them were for the Lord. More than once when I spoke with them, they would kneel down and repent in tears. But the same thing would happen again. They argued about their opinions because their self had not been stripped away by God. They did not allow God to put their self on the altar. If you want to serve as a deacon, you have to make up your mind from the first day to offer the self to God and allow Him to deal with it.</p><h2 class="head2">Bridling the Tongue</h2><p>In serving the Lord in the church, the deacons' tongues have to be bridled by God in the strictest way. If a deacon's tongue is not dealt with, he will render as much trouble to the church as he renders help. He will tear down as much as he builds up. In the past when we asked a person to be a deacon, we asked him to speak little. Now when we ask a person to be a deacon, we ask him not to speak at all. As deacons your job is to exercise your hands and your feet, not your mouth. This is the reason 1 Timothy 3:8 speaks of a deacon not being double-tongued. A deacon has much contact with the brothers and sisters; he knows the saints more than others. He may know something others do not know. He may be aware of private embarrassments of the brothers and sisters which are hidden from others. If he wanted to gossip, he would have much material to gossip about. If your tongue is not bridled, you will be the top telegraph operator or communication officer in the church; you will easily broadcast news to your entire city.</p><p>In the world everyone likes to exaggerate a subject in order to satisfy the lust for sensationalism. A deacon should find excuses to extricate himself from any conversation. He should not make any comment concerning the church. Even when others ask, he should not be tempted to speak. He should always look for ways to extricate himself. After a fellowship meeting, a deacon comes home and faces temptation immediately. As soon as his wife asks him something, he may spill out everything that transpired in the fellowship. He may argue that his wife is probing, but actually, he wants to tell. A wife is not the only one who likes to ask questions; other people like to ask questions as well. They like to hear something from you. When your wife or husband asks anything, you should answer in a gentle way, "You should not ask this, and I should not say anything about this." I answer my wife this way all the time. If we treasure God's church and work and if we consider them high and noble, how dare we talk about affairs and decisions in a light way? Even if the information we have is correct, we must consider the paramount question: "Am I allowed to speak of this in the first place?"</p><p>I often ask the brothers and sisters what they would say when others ask them about the subject of the deacons' meeting. You have to say, "I am a deacon. I can listen and I can ask questions in such a meeting. I can even speak in such a meeting. Once I walk out of the door, however, I have no right to say anything, and others do not have the right to ask me anything." I hope that no brother or sister will discuss church affairs in private. I hope that none will discuss the work under any circumstance. We should only build up, not tear down. We should only edify, not destroy. If anyone has any feeling at all, he should speak up in the meeting. Once he steps out of the meeting hall, he cannot express anything to anyone. It is hard to find a brother or sister who speaks the same thing inside and outside the door. When you ask for his opinion inside the door, he has nothing to say. He nods his head to everything, but once he steps out of the building, he talks loudly and expresses many things. The deacons have to learn to speak properly when it is their time to speak but remain quiet when it is not their time to speak. If they are not in the right place, touching the right things, and before the right people, they should not speak anything.</p><h2 class="head2">The Secret to Our Work&mdash;Perfecting Others</h2><p>The job of the deacons is not only to be trained and to get things done but to raise up people and perfect them. They must not only strive and learn to do things properly themselves but must continually raise up others to do the same thing. The goal of work in the church is not just to get things done but to raise up proper vessels. It is wrong to have many people in the meetings and many things waiting to be done but not have the proper people to do them. The deacons must latch on to some people and work together with them. They should be like eels in the sea that move around by latching on to each others' tails.</p><p>Many people have peculiar dispositions. There are mainly two kinds of peculiarities. The first is telling others what to do without raising a single finger yourself. The second is trying to do everything by yourself. You only have the confidence to use yourself. The proper way is to do everything with others and by others. You have to wait for others to catch up with you. You have to have the patience to perfect others and train them. If you are too harsh, others will not follow you. Being capable does not mean being able to do everything by yourself but being able to show others how to do the same thing that you are doing and to do it just as well or even better. This is what it means to be capable. The problem with northern Chinese housewives is that most of them cannot retain a servant for too long. The reason is not that the servants are ill-tempered or cold but that the housewives always think that they can do a better job. To them it is hard to find one servant under the sun who is qualified. There is always such a fallen concept in man. But we have to learn, to be dealt with, and to assign things to others; we have to help them to do the things. This is the way to perfect others.</p><p>The deacons must accept the arrangements of the elders. They must also learn to work in coordination with the brothers and sisters. In handling business affairs, they have to learn to "sacrifice" and relinquish their responsibilities to the saints. If the deacons are the only ones who are busy from dawn to dusk, they need to be rebuked because they have not raised up anyone. This is wrong. You should not do things by yourself. In Taipei I pay much attention to the deacons' ability to raise up others. In arranging business affairs, we should not assign the jobs simply to the deacons but should distribute the work through the deacons to the hands of the brothers and sisters. The deacons must be able to work themselves, and they must also charge others to do the same work. They must be able to work in coordination with the saints, and they must raise up as many people as possible. The deacons cannot wait passively on the elders. It is wrong for them to do nothing, but it is also wrong for them to do everything by themselves. They must work with their own hands, and they must raise up others to do the same.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Working according to One's Habit</h2><p>Lastly, the deacons have to learn diligently before the Lord not to work according to their own disposition and nature. They should not quibble over small things. Everyone has his own disposition and nature. In Taiwan I always tell the brothers and sisters that human habit is primarily a product of natural disposition. If a Chinese is raised up in a foreigner's home, he will grow up acting like a foreigner; his habit will overshadow his original Chinese disposition. In the world everyone likes to say, "This is the way I am used to doing things." But you cannot say, "This is the way I am used to arranging the chairs." You have to arrange chairs and clean windows according to the heavenly pattern. You may ask, "What should I do?" My answer is, "In the church you have to learn to ask." You may wonder whom you should ask. You know whom you should ask. The answer is simple. Whoever assigns you to arrange the chairs and clean the windows and whoever commissions you to a job is the responsible one. You have to go to him and ask him. You must learn to ask before doing anything. Should you use a wet towel or a dry towel to wipe the chairs and the windows? You should follow neither the northern habit nor the southern habit. Instead, you have to ask all the time. This will show you how much of the self has been cut away from you every day. This is good. It is the most beautiful thing in the universe to ask. Those who are in charge of chair arranging should not make decisions themselves either but should ask those above them. In the end the asking will go all the way back to the Head. If a responsible brother cannot follow orders, he can never give orders. A Christian must learn to take orders. If you can take orders, you can give orders. I am afraid that some brothers and sisters can neither take orders nor give orders. The church is a place of confusion when this happens.</p><p>Perhaps you still do not understand what I am saying. Let me ask: What would you do if you come to the meeting and see a chair turned upside down? If one brother answers, "Turn it back up," this is terrible. If another one says, "Leave it alone," how can one neglect this, being a part of the family? The best answer is, "Find out who is responsible for the chairs and check with him." If you do this, you will realize how much you have been dealt with in the church service, how much of the self is removed, and how much you have been perfected.</p><p>If we pay attention to the above points, we will see that many will be ushered into the service because of us, and many will be perfected to be sent out to other places. All the brothers and sisters who are learning to serve the Lord should pay attention to these points.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Watchman Nee: In the church there is no human authority; there is only the authority of the Holy Spirit. The church has been here on earth for a long time, but God has never entrusted its service to any human individuals. In the church not even the elders are the authority. You are not the authority. Any move in the church service should be the result of the direction of the Holy Spirit. Anyone acting or deliberating apart from the direction of the Holy Spirit is being rebellious and seditious. Perhaps you do not know how rebellious and seditious you were in the past.</p><p>Neither the elders nor the deacons have any authority in themselves. Authority is from the Holy Spirit. The church cannot tolerate any kind of rebellion. Any announcement or change must be carried out in the authority of the Holy Spirit. If the brothers and sisters have been dealt with by the Spirit in a deep way, they will know immediately if a church is in rebellion. We have absolutely no intention of building up an earthly organization here. Our hope is that the authority of the Holy Spirit would flow from the most mature brothers to the youngest one. Let me repeat: Neither the brothers and sisters nor the deacons and elders have any authority in themselves. Only the Holy Spirit has the authority.</p><p>There are two basic principles operating in the church&mdash;love and authority. Where there is a lack of love, the relationship among the brothers and sisters falters. Where there is a lack of authority, the relationship with the Holy Spirit falters. Horizontally there is love, and vertically there is authority. If the Head is not honored with His rightful authority, the church will not experience the blessing that flows from the Head. Therefore, even the smallest arrangement in the church must not be carried out presumptuously without the direction of the Holy Spirit. The brothers and sisters have to develop a habit of asking. They should ask the responsible brothers everything. In the end, the elders have to bring all the matters to God. The elders are not men with sharper and quicker mentalities. They are the ones who have learned more lessons and have spent more time before the Lord. They know God's heart more. They must be clear about God's will before they tell the brothers and sisters what to do.</p><p>Some people have been Christians for over ten or twenty years, but they still have not learned the habit of asking. I will tell you a secret. The Lord has given me the responsibility of examining the young brothers; I try to ascertain if they are suitable and qualified for the work. We examine many things. One of the things we examine is whether or not they have a habit of asking. If a man does not have the habit of asking, his self is not yet broken, and he will probably serve according to his self-will. He will build a yard only to tear it down again later. He may even do worse, tearing down the adjacent walls as well.</p><p>Unless the Lord's authority is clearly manifest among us, our service will be a mere rallying of the flesh. We will come together to build Babel, and the result will be nothing but total confusion. We should never despise the smallest work in the church or think that a work is so insignificant that there is no need to ask anyone about it. Even a work as mundane as cleaning chairs is special. We serve in coordination by submitting to the authority of the Holy Spirit; we do not serve according to our past concepts and habits.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Saturday evening, February 18, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Lord, we thank and praise You for becoming flesh, living a life on the earth, bringing God's will, His work, and His word to the world, and showing us a clear way to go on. Lord, we confess that the church in Hong Kong is in a fallen state. We cannot hide from the shining of Your great light. But we thank and praise You. Through Your servants You have presented Your will and way before us. Grant us the grace and power to go on in the way that pleases You.</p><p>Lord, how we thank and praise You for giving the spiritual gifts and inheritance to the church throughout the past two thousand years. We also praise and thank You for revealing Your will and heart's desire to us through Your servants. You have put us in this closing period of the end time when Your coming is so imminent, and You have shown us such abundant light and such a clear way. May we not miss the opportunity. May all of us be willing and able to forsake everything to serve You as our Lord and our King. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE CHURCH<br />TO SUBDIVIDE INTO DISTRICTS</h2><p>Witness Lee: According to the Bible, a church should be local. The boundary of the locality is determined by the boundary of its civic administrative unit. The Bible shows us local churches, but it does not have churches on a street or churches in a district. The justification for starting a church is not based on its number of members. A local church may cover a large geographical area and may have a large number of people, but it is still one church. Of course, it is hard for a church that is large geographically or numerically to take care of the needs of every brother and sister. The church in Jerusalem began with three thousand and then five thousand saved ones. When Paul returned to Jerusalem to meet James, there were tens of thousands of believers in that city (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20). It is not an easy thing for a church of this size to carry out something or to meet the needs of every brother and sister. Therefore, there is the need to subdivide such a church into districts to facilitate the work and to reach and visit the saints easily. The districts are not the church, but they are almost like mini local churches; they fulfill many of the functions of a church. They have their own meetings, they cover many practical affairs, and they exercise care over all the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBLE ONES IN THE DISTRICTS</h2><h2 class="head2">Caring for and Cherishing the Saints like Elders</h2><p>The districts have responsible ones. This is an important function. On the one hand, these responsible ones have to care for the saints like elders. On the other hand, they have to be diligent like the deacons. The responsible ones in a district must make proper arrangements before the meetings, take the lead during the meetings, and clean up after the meetings. In short they have to act as the elders in the districts. This is a manner of speaking only; it does not mean that they actually carry the title of elder. If you are a responsible one in a district, you bear a much heavier responsibility for the souls of the people than the elders bear. It is not possible for the elders to know all the brothers and sisters. But as a responsible brother in a district, you have to know every brother and sister in your district. You have to take up the spiritual burden of all the saints in your district. If we cannot do this, we are merely splitting our meetings into districts; we have not fulfilled the real purpose of subdivision, which is to spread the care to the districts.</p><p>The responsible brothers have to make proper arrangements in the districts for the follow-up work of all the ones received into our bread-breaking meeting. You cannot let one name slip away. If a brother or sister has been assigned to your district, you have to exercise care over him or her in a proper way. First, you have to know the names of all the brothers and sisters. Second, you have to know their faces. You must recognize them and must not let them go away easily. Third, you have to know their background, including their school, family, and environment. Fourth, you have to know their spiritual condition. For example, you have to know how long they have been saved, whether or not they are meeting regularly, whether they have the experience of loving the Lord, and whether they are zealous for the gospel. Perhaps you have to ask them, "You have been saved for a long time already. Have you led anyone to the Lord?"</p><p>The responsible ones in a district have to be like the elders; they have to care for the brothers and sisters, to cherish them and nourish them with the heart of a father. They have to open up their hearts to the brothers and sisters. They have to exercise a fatherly concern for them. Whether or not God's work will prosper among us depends not so much on the procedures and methods but on the amount of care we pour out on the saints. It depends on the fatherly and motherly compassion we exercise over God's children.</p><h2 class="head2">Working under the Elders like Deacons</h2><p>A local church can be subdivided into districts based on number or on need, but its administration cannot be divided. A few people in a district cannot decide what that district should do or how they should do it; they cannot take things into their own hand and work independently. The administration of the church is based on its locality. The business affairs, the shepherding, the care, and the perfecting of the saints in a church can be conducted in the districts, but first they must be discussed in fellowship with the church as a whole. The responsible ones in a district have to pay attention to one thing more than the elders: They have to learn to ask before they do anything. This is similar to what the deacons have to do. This applies not only to the care of the meetings, to the management of business affairs, but to the heading up of the work as well.</p><p>The responsible ones in a district are almost like elders, and yet they are not exactly the same as the elders of a local church. For this reason the responsible brothers in a district have to learn to refer matters to the elders. This is beneficial to them in more than one sense. The main emphasis of the church should not be business affairs, but spiritual affairs. The responsible ones in a district have to learn not to make any decisions in the districts. In everything they first must fellowship with the elders. They must receive orders from the elders. If the business decisions and methods of the elders do not work, they should first go back to the elders. Never make any changes independently. We are humans, and even the elders can make mistakes. Of course, they have learned more lessons from God, and it is less likely for them to make mistakes. Here you have to learn the lessons. If something is wrong, you have to refer back to the elders. This will force the elders to go to God and come up with the right way. If you deliberate and act independently, you will only bring damage to the church, not profit. A district is not a stand-alone local church.</p><h2 class="head2">Arrangements to Be Made in a Local Church</h2><p>Visitation of the saints should be carried out in the districts. There is the need of careful arrangement in this matter. The districts should also make decisions concerning their business affairs. For example, we may have to borrow a saint's home for the district meeting. In so doing we should use such a home for our meeting only; we should not overburden that saint's household. We should set up the place ourselves and make the proper arrangements before and after the meetings. We should even prepare the drinking water by boiling it ahead of time. Every matter&mdash;great or small, general or specific&mdash;that goes on in the districts should be listed. Either the responsible brothers have to take care of it themselves, or they have to assign the brothers and sisters to take care of it. Gospel visitation should also be conducted in the districts under the direction and supervision of the districts.</p><h2 class="head1">PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE SERVICE<br />OF THE RESPONSIBLE ONES IN A DISTRICT</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Acting according to Emotions</h2><p>The responsible ones in a district should work like a machine. This is especially true in their coordination with the brothers and sisters. You have to function like a machine. You cannot work according to your own emotions, preference, or temperament. As a responsible one in a district, you cannot work according to your own likes, preferences, or disposition. You have to be like a machine, running or stopping according to the on-off switch, not according to your own likes and dislikes. As soon as the switch turns on, you operate mechanically.</p><p>In the church we do not want anyone to do anything out of a good heart or out of his own zeal. When a person acts according to his emotion, he is like a thermometer that has no calibration at all. Parents cannot stop feeding and clothing their children just because they misbehave. If you deal with your children according to just your emotion, you are not qualified to be a parent. Some people scorch others when they are zealous but put others into the freezer when they are cold. Suppose Brother Nee has a cook who acts according to his own preference. When our brother wants noodles, the cook serves porridge. What can he do to such a cook except discharge him? Such a cook can only be a master; he can never be a servant. If a man acts according to his emotion, he will damage others when he is emotionally high, and he will damage others when he is emotionally low.</p><p>You have to go to the Lord all the time to find out how much you love Him. You have to say to Him, "Lord, I am willing to put my temperament, preference, and emotions on the altar." When children provoke their parents to anger, the parents often consider giving up on their children. But they are compelled to go on because they love their children. We have to be brought to the point where we work all the time, whether or not we like it. We do it because the Lord loves us and because we love Him. If we work only when we feel like working, we are like an unreliable thermometer. Others will not know what clothes to wear when they read us.</p><p>One passage in the Old Testament touches me very much. When Aaron's two sons died before the Lord because they offered strange fire, Moses ordered Aaron not to mourn (Lev. 10:1-7). Moses was a faithful servant of God. Aaron also knew God very well. Their work was to serve God in His presence. God required that they not mix their own personal affections with His work. When God says that no one should mourn, no one can mourn. Even if a person wants to cry, he can only swallow his tears. Whatever you have to do, you should do it. You cannot overstretch your hands when you feel like it or stop working when you do not feel like it. Your likes and dislikes should not affect the way you work. Let emotions rise and fall. With the Lord's grace in us, we can continue with our work all the time.</p><h2 class="head2">Rejecting Natural Affections</h2><p>The responsible ones in a district should also be on the alert against the encroachment of natural affections; they should guard against acting by their own emotions. Among the brothers and sisters, they should only exercise a love that is in Christ. They should not develop any natural affection through their service. The more divine love there is, the better it is. Natural affection must be denied. Two people become friends through working together and developing an affinity for each other. In the church we should condemn natural affection; it is something loathsome. Some good brothers and sisters have fallen by the wayside just because they were not careful in this matter. Natural affection can kill the church life. In the Old Testament God ordained that the meal offering must be free from honey (Lev. 2:11). Both leaven and honey kill the church life.</p><p>Brother Chao Ching-hwai and I have been coordinating with each other for over twenty years. During those years, except for the purpose of discussing spiritual work and meeting various needs related to our service, I never visited his home. I was afraid that human love would be mixed in with our love in the Lord. In order to maintain the boundary that the Lord has laid down, I even went out of my way to guard against visiting his home. I can testify that we only maintain a divine love in the Lord; we have not developed a natural affection outside the Lord. Today many brothers and sisters get into trouble when they develop some affections through living together or coordinating together. We must have much spiritual fellowship, but we should guard against pitfalls.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Christians have no friendships; they only have brothers. Their relationships with each other are brotherly relationships. Whenever we fall from a brotherly relationship to friends, our Christian life is finished. The New Testament contains all kinds of teachings. It speaks of relationships between masters and slaves, parents and children, and husbands and wives. But it does not say anything about friendships. This is the most peculiar thing about Christianity. You can have only worldly friends, not spiritual friends. We should replace our friends in the world with brothers and sisters in the Lord. Our contact with each other should only be in the form of coordination, service, and fellowship. We should not have any other kind of unnecessary contact. The Lord charges us to love one another as He loves us. We should lay down our lives for our brothers (cf. John 15:13). This love transcends any kind of friendship. The love we experience in our coordination is beyond any kind of human love.</p><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF VISITING NEW ONES</h2><p>We have to take care of visiting new believers in a proper way. This is a very important work. If a hired worker takes care of another person's sheep in Kuling and the sheep begets an ewe, the hired hand can claim half of the ewe. If the mother lamb begets two ewes, the hired worker can claim one of them, but if the sheep dies, he will have to pay for the loss. The master will only accept more when he receives back his entrustment; he cannot settle for less. In the future we will have to give an account at the judgment seat of Christ. The Lord has entrusted a certain number of people to the church. We should hand back at least that many people to Him. The elders must charge the responsible ones in a district to make proper arrangements for visiting new believers. They must never lose or drop anyone. The Lord has entrusted men to the church, not just to the elders. The brothers in all the districts should have this kind of feeling. They should feel the pressure to not lose anyone, realizing that they will have to give an account to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">A LOVE FOR THE BROTHERS</h2><p>It is not a happy thing to see a brother stumble. It is neither something to be angry about. We feel sorry and sad at the loss of any brother. Do not think that it is a light thing to lose a brother. Over ten years ago, a group of brothers and sisters wept continuously for six full days over the excommunication of a co-worker. Their tears were more bitter than anything they had experienced previously. Eventually, they decided to carry through with the excommunication. The excommunicated one was very angry. He wrote a long letter rebuking me. I only answered with a few words. I told him that while he was rebuking us, we were weeping for him for six full days. He was in wrath, but the brothers and sisters were in sorrow. We were hoping that this brother would turn, and we grieved over his excommunication. Our hearts were sad over this loss.</p><p>If a church builds up itself in love (Eph. 4:16), it will become a channel through which God will save all men. It will be able to look beyond itself to save other souls. If a church rises up and is up to the standard, many men will be brought in, and God will save many. For this reason we all have to learn to love the brothers, care for them, help them, and perfect them. We should do everything we can to gain every brother.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK BY WATCHMAN NEE<br />AFTER A MEETING<br />ON STUDYING THE BIBLE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Saturday evening, February 18, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">FINDING WHAT OUR PREDECESSORS HAVE REAPED</h2><p>In studying the Bible it is crucial that we not despise "the light from the prophets." We should not despise the light our predecessors have gained. Throughout the ages many people have learned many things from the Lord. They have received much enlightenment from His Word. We have to look up and study their work.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ORIGINAL TEXT</h2><p>Second, in studying the Word we have to pay attention to the original text. As far as translations are concerned, the Chinese Union Version is much better and more accurate than the King James Version in English. The Greek text on which the Chinese Version is based is a much better text. Of course, in some areas it is inferior to other versions. The Revised Standard Version of 1881 is also better than the King James Version. Its translation is better, and it is superior to the King James Version in many respects. Of all the English versions, Darby's translation tops the list in terms of its understanding of the meaning of the original text. Many denominations do not accept unauthorized versions. As a result, Darby's version has not been very popular. But a student of the Bible should always look up Darby's translation.</p><p>Perhaps we can use the Interlinear Greek New Testament (Stephanus Greek text), Tischendorf's text (Codex Sinaiticus), the Revised Standard Version, Darby's translation, plus the Chinese Union Version. With these five different versions, we will probably arrive at an accurate understanding of a passage.</p><h2 class="head1">PARAPHRASING</h2><p>Paraphrasing means rewriting the words of the Bible in language that can be easily understood. In the New Testament Paul's Epistles occupy a pivotal place. We can try to rewrite his Epistles using our own words. If we do not understand a certain passage, we can look up Conybeare's and Howson's commentaries. Their writings are of the same nature as Darby's Synopsis of the Bible, and they are excellent expositional writings. Through paraphrasing we will realize that every word in the Bible is meaningful and crucial. If our paraphrasing is done properly, we will come to know God's will. If our paraphrasing is done improperly, we will end up with many serious mistakes.</p><p>In the eighteenth century, so-called textual criticism was very popular in Germany. This criticism was mainly of two categories. One was lower criticism being done by believers. This was like the textual research work done by many in the late Ching dynasty. The other was higher criticism being done by unbelievers. This was like the ancient Saduccees. The higher critics are today's modernists. They are the liberals. Lower critics include such people as Wordsworth, Bloomfield, and Henry Alford. They spent much time to evaluate every word of the Bible. They were familiar with every word and carefully studied classical Greek as well as biblical Greek. Today our study of the Bible is based on the result of their research. In order to train ourselves in paraphrasing, we have to reference their works. Of the critical works of these three, Alford's writings are the best. If there is any doubt, his interpretation should be taken as the standard.</p><h2 class="head1">BIBLE EXPOSITION</h2><p>The best books on Bible exposition are found among the Brethren. Among the Brethren writers, Darby's work tops the list. In the course of a few decades, God gave many of them particular gifts. In order to study the Bible well, we have to go to their books.</p><p>William Kelly and F. W. Grant also have written fine works on Bible exposition. They were distinguished students of Darby. Spurgeon once said that Kelly's mind was as broad as the universe, but his view was limited by Darby's influence. His writings show a high degree of scholarship. Grant was very short in physical stature, but he wrote with much foresight. He had great spiritual capacity. Even when he criticized others, his criticism was like music to the listeners' ears. His writings were more inspirational than Kelly's.</p><p>There are also the writings of H. C. G. Moule. Many British highly recommend his writings because they are somewhat critical in style. There is also F. L. Godet. He was a highly respected and spiritual Swiss theologian.</p><h2 class="head1">ASSIGNING CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES<br />TO EACH PERSON FOR STUDYING THE BIBLE,<br />THEN COMING TOGETHER TO SHARE THE RESULTS</h2><p>The co-workers should have Bible study meetings. They can begin with the book of Romans. Use the following way: First, one brother should read Romans 1:1 aloud. Then another brother should read this verse aloud according to the Revised Standard Version. A third should read Darby's translation. A fourth should compare these versions with the original language and read the result aloud. Finally, the leading brother should decide which translation is the best. After studying the text, they should study the expositional writings of these few writers, as well as the commentaries. After they have studied this way, they will realize that not only were they too sloppy in studying the Word, but also many famous writers in this world are sloppy students. The worst thing is for a person to have only one version and to treat it as a foolproof text. Some people go even further; they do not read any reference books at all. Some of us have a good foundation in Bible study because by nature we like to read reference books. This study is much more reliable. Both Brother Witness and I study the Bible according to the above method. I hope that some brothers and sisters will put forth the effort to study the Bible this way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">DEMONSTRATION ON<br />HOW TO CONDUCT A BIBLE STUDY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:February 20, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Rom. 1:1</h1><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 1:1</h2><h2 class="head2">"Slave," "Separated," "the Gospel of God"</h2><p>Romans 1:1 says, "Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God." In ancient custom and law, a slave was a person owned by his master. The master had absolute right over his slave. He could even dictate whether the slave should live or die. Paul was such a slave of Christ. He was bought by Christ, not merely hired by Him as a servant. Paul was also a called apostle. This is like a doctor, who is called to heal. Paul was "separated" specially for the gospel of God. The expression unto the gospel of God implies propagation and defense. Paul not only preached the gospel with his mouth; his entire being was separated unto the gospel. Even his tent making was for the gospel. Whether or not he preached with his mouth was a separate issue; the main thing was that his entire being was for the gospel.</p><p>Henry Alford maintained the King James translation of servant instead of slave. He said that slave implies someone without any freedom of his own. But an apostle is one who is called by God in a particular way; he possesses the highest office. The word apostle, or "sent one," is not used in a general sense; it carries a higher and more special meaning. The twelve apostles, plus James the brother of the Lord, as well as Paul, had received such a title. Only those who are specially called by God can be called an "apostle."</p><p>Paul said that he was the least of the apostles, one chosen by the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:9-10). He was separated by God in a special way, even from his mother's womb (Gal. 1:15). Paul was separated unto the gospel of God. The expression the gospel of God tells us that this gospel is of God. The word God is a possessive noun qualifying the gospel; it is not in apposition to the gospel. This gospel comes from God. This means that salvation comes absolutely from grace.</p><p>Simply speaking, Paul, as a slave, had no liberty of his own. Like it or not, he belonged to God. This calling was not a common calling. If it were, everyone would have had such a calling. As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he is a called saint (Rom. 1:7). This is the common calling, but Paul's calling was special. We can see how special his calling was from Acts 9 (vv. 3-19). Finally, this gospel is the gospel of God. This means that the very nature of this gospel is of God.</p><p>H. C. G. Moule said that Paul took Jesus Christ as his absolute master. This is the reason he adopted the title "a slave of Jesus Christ." He said that the word slave denotes two things: one who is bought with a price, and one who surrenders himself. The gospel of God in a particular sense is the gospel of Christ, for only in Christ is God truly revealed (John 17:3).</p><h2 class="head2">"Jesus Christ" versus "Christ Jesus"</h2><p>The expression Jesus Christ is used only eight times in this book. In Acts it is used over ten times, and in the Gospels it is used five times. In the Epistles, most of the time the expression used is Christ Jesus. Jesus and Christ are two different names of the Lord during two different periods of His life. Jesus is the name the Lord took as a man on earth. Christ is the name the Lord took in resurrection when He was exalted and confirmed by God. Jesus Christ refers to the fact that Jesus, the One who once lived on earth, is now exalted and confirmed by God (Acts 2:36). This speaks of His living on earth and His glorification on the throne. The expression Christ Jesus emphasizes Christ, the One who has received the glory. This Christ has the name Jesus appended to it, showing us that the glorified Christ is the very Jesus who was once a man. In the entire New Testament, we only see the expression in Christ Jesus, never in Jesus Christ. We can only be in Christ, not in Jesus. Even if we were able to live at the time that the Lord Jesus lived on earth and even if we were able to live like Jesus, we could never have gone to the cross and borne man's sins. If we were in Him while He was on earth, we would have partaken of the redemptive work of the cross. This is contrary to the truth. Everything was done by Him alone on our behalf. We have not done anything for Him. God has put us in Christ. We are in Christ Jesus through the Holy Spirit. When the Bible speaks of the Lord Himself, it uses the expression Jesus Christ, and when it speaks of our position in Christ, it uses the expression Christ Jesus.</p><p>There are two schools of thought regarding the translation of Romans 1:1. One renders Jesus Christ, while the other renders Christ Jesus. Those who translate Christ Jesus think that Paul first saw the glory of Christ and then willingly became a slave of Christ to "preach...Christ Jesus as Lord" (2 Cor. 4:5a). But those who translate Jesus Christ say that Paul was emphasizing his being a slave of Jesus, not a slave of Christ. Men despise Jesus Christ, but Paul was willing to be His slave. He considered himself a slave of Jesus Christ, bought by Him through His redemption, death, and shedding of blood. Paul's declaration was his honoring and exaltation of this Jesus Christ. As far as Paul was concerned, he knew the excellency of Christ already. He was clear about His excellency and His glory, but now he wanted others to know the excellency of the man Jesus. His preaching was not only to make known "Christ Jesus as Lord," but himself "as your slaves for Jesus' sake" (2 Cor. 4:5b).</p><p>Moule argued against Alford, saying that the word servant should be slave, meaning someone bought and someone who submits willingly. On the one hand, Christ bought Paul with His own blood unto Himself. On the other hand, Paul willingly submitted and offered himself to be a slave of Christ. We are slaves of Christ in both of the above senses.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECT OF ROMANS&mdash;THE PURE GOSPEL</h2><p>F. W. Grant said that the book of Romans is a complete and accurate thesis on the gospel. Everything spoken of in this book is an argument and counterpoint against any possible objection. The more precious and fundamental a truth is, the more men will summon their wisdom to overthrow it. Paul uses this Epistle to defend the gospel. The subject of Romans is the pure gospel. First, it points out that both the Gentiles and the Jews are under sin and cannot stand before the judgment seat of God. Next, Paul points out God's righteousness. This is the very thing that a condemned sinner is afraid of, but it becomes the very shelter and protection to an enlightened sinner when Christ's sacrificial work is revealed. By faith we are justified, and God's righteousness become ours. This gospel not only forgives the sinner of his sins, but secures a new position for the believer. The first part of Romans reveals the power of the blood which Christ shed for the sinner. When we believe in Him, our sins are forgiven. When Christ resurrected, the believers were justified by God. We stand on new ground in Christ and experience God's grace. Once a man receives this precious gospel, he can do nothing but preach it.</p><p>Grant is one of the most famous Bible expositors. Darby is also an able expositor. The former is short in stature while the latter is tall. There is another one, Frederick Louis Godet, who was an orthodox theologian. He represented the continental European school of theology. He was also a very spiritual man.</p><p>One brother said that the King James Version does not pay much attention to the difference between Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus. The same is true with Darby's translation.</p><p>Brother Yu: The Greeks spoke of peace in their salutation. But Paul spoke of blessing. He spoke about his ministry and calling first because he did not know the Christians in Rome that well, and he had to recommend himself and declare his status. The word slave is used also in Galatians 3:28 and 1 Timothy 6:1.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Martin Luther said that the word slave denotes modesty and majesty. In Revelation 22 John wanted to worship the angel, but the angel said that he was a fellow slave (vv. 8-9). It is a glory to be a slave of Jesus Christ! The word serve in Greek denotes a respectful and willing service. This word is used to describe the service of the prophets and kings. The service of a slave is the lowliest and meanest work; it is a work that unties others' sandals. When Paul said that he was a slave of Jesus Christ, he had the same spirit as that of John the Baptist.</p><p>The expression the gospel of God does not merely mean that the gospel speaks of God or that it is about God. Rather, it means that the gospel is established by God and initiated by Him (cf. Rom. 15:16; 1 Thes. 2:2, 8-9).</p><h2 class="head1">CALLED TO BE A STEWARD OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</h2><p>Paul was a slave of Christ. Paul testified that he was happy to render his service to the Lord as a slave bought by the blood of Christ. At the same time, he was an apostle appointed by God and called by Him unto the service of the gospel. Like it or not, he was separated unto the gospel. He was not solicited by God; he was drafted by Him into the army. He was drafted and enrolled to meet God's need. This is the reason Paul was called to be an apostle. Being separated means being set apart from all men, things, and events, and being made different. This separation happens in three stages. First, in Galatians 1:15 we are told that Paul was separated by God from his mother's womb. This is like the firstborn of Israel being separated unto God in the Old Testament (Exo. 13:12; 22:29-30). Second, in Acts 26:16-18 Paul was separated by the Lord to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. This proves Romans 1:1 which speaks of being separated unto the gospel of God. Third, in Acts 13:2, he and Barnabas were separated by the Holy Spirit unto the work that He had prepared. In these three separations, Paul was called by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit respectively, and all the separations were for the gospel.</p><p>The word gospel means the glad tidings. This is the sum total of the divine economy. The first eight chapters of Romans deal with the matter of salvation. Chapters one through five cover the gospel of grace. Chapters nine through eleven cover God's selection, which relates to His sovereignty in His divine economy. From chapter twelve onward, the book covers the fellowship of the church and various guidelines related to it. Paul was called unto this gospel. This does not mean that he was called to speak at the podium, but that he was called to be the steward of the entire gospel of God. He labored and endeavored for the entire gospel.</p><p>Next time, before we come together again, we have to digest all the reference materials at home first. We cannot wait until we are here to digest the material.</p><p>Witness Lee: The first verse gives us the noun-subject. Paul began with the word Paulos, his own name. Following this, he spoke of his three qualifications. These three qualifications qualify the noun-subject (Paulos). This is like a business card in which the name of a person appears first, followed by his titles.</p><p>Paul spoke in a defensive tone in his letter to the Roman Christians. This is because men at that time could not easily accept the gospel. Paul did not use his own name when he wrote the book of Hebrews. But in Romans 1:1 he put down his own name and showed his qualifications. This is the authority by which he was commissioned for the preaching of the gospel. In this declaration he said that he was not only called but also separated unto the gospel of God. The gospel of God is the gospel that Paul preached.</p><p>Verses 2 through 6 give an overall explanation of this gospel, because the predicate does not appear until verse 7. Verse 7 is a new beginning. The words in verses 2 through 6 are parenthetical words. In the New Testament, we find at least fifty to sixty such parenthetical passages.</p><p>William Kelly was a great Bible expositor of the last century. He was a doctor in theology but later gave up his theological degree. Over seventy years ago when he wrote about the word servant in Romans 1:1, he pointed out that a servant is a slave. In man's eyes such a person is lowly, but it was different for Paul. He was a slave of Christ Jesus. Paul seemed to be boasting about this. Outsiders probably cannot understand what he was saying. Only those who know the liberty and sanctification of grace can boast of such a title&mdash;"a slave of Christ Jesus." No one else is taught this way, and no one else can enjoy this privilege. We are called saints, but Paul was a called apostle. Apostleship is not hereditary or self-appointed, but commissioned and separated by God. Paul was an apostle for the gospel of God. Why did he not say the gospel of Christ? Although the gospel was accomplished by Christ, the source of this gospel is God. No doubt, the gospel can only be found in Christ and through Christ. But "the gospel of God" points us to God as the ultimate source of the gospel.</p><p>William R. Newell is an American Bible expositor. He told us that in the beginning of the book of Romans we only find the name of Paul, not Silas, Timothy, or other brothers. Only he was called by Christ to be an apostle to the Gentiles (Gal. 2:8-9) and a herald of the gospel in that age. The book of Ephesians also bears only the name of Paul. This is because he was the only one who saw the great revelation of Ephesians. At the beginning of Romans, he calls himself a slave, one bought with a price. This expression speaks of his most noble aspiration. The word called is used three times from verse 1 through verse 7. Calling is God's act of designation and separation. In verse 6 the saints are "the called ones of Jesus Christ." The believers are given to Christ by the Father (John 17). They were joined to Him before there was even the history of the world: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world" (Eph. 1:4). Romans 1:7 speaks of the called saints (not called to be saints). This does not mean that we are asked to become saints&mdash;a teaching of the Catholic Church. We are called under God's sovereignty as saints. We are the holy ones, those who are washed by Christ's blood and who are created in Christ. This is what we are. Even the angels did not become angels through a process of sanctification; they were created angels. This is what Paul means when he says that he was called.</p><p>Paul was called and summoned for the gospel of God. The gospel is God's glad tidings. It is God who loves the world. It is God who sent His Son to us. Hence, the gospel is the message that tells us about God's love. This was Paul's commission.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE "APOSTLE"</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Ephesians 4:8 says that the Lord gave apostles to His church after His ascension. However, we know that the twelve apostles were appointed before His ascension. Hence, the apostles appointed after His ascension were different from the twelve apostles. Even in the kingdom age, their position will be different. The twelve apostles will not only reign and rule with the Lord, but will sit on the twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28).</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul talked about his experience of being called to be an apostle. He said that the Lord appeared directly to him and called him. In verse 5 he said that Christ appeared to "the twelve." In verse 7 he said that the Lord appeared to James, the brother of the Lord. The same verse also says that the Lord appeared also "to all the apostles." These apostles certainly were not the twelve apostles. Perhaps they refer to an ordinary group of apostles who were appointed by the Holy Spirit to continue the work of the first apostles.</p><p>Acts 13 speaks of Paul and Barnabas being called by the Holy Spirit to be apostles to the Gentiles. Of the original twelve apostles, Judas died on account of his evil. Some people do not consider Matthias to be one of the twelve and artificially put Paul as one of the twelve apostles. But Acts 1 says that Matthias was "counted with the eleven apostles" (vv. 24-26). In chapter two it says, "Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth" (v. 14). This shows us that the Holy Spirit recognized Matthias as being one of the twelve apostles. Paul was an apostle; so was Barnabas. Even Silas and Timothy were called apostles. Romans 16:7 shows us clearly that Andronicus and Junia were apostles also.</p><p>Revelation 2:2 speaks of false apostles. This book was written between the end of A.D. 95 and the beginning of A.D. 96. At that time John was old, and most of the apostles of that age were dead. John was the only one left. It was difficult to know who were real apostles and who were false. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that apostles must be tested.</p><p>Apostles are those who are sent out by God's grace. The death of the twelve apostles did not terminate the lineage of apostleship. In Roman Catholicism, the pope at the Vatican appoints himself as an apostle. The term apostle carries a special significance and status because of this. This is wrong. One item to be recovered in the Bible is the producing of apostles. Neither Paul nor I can be counted as one of the twelve. Yet we can still be apostles. The proof of apostleship is first in God's sending and then in the church's confirmation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">ON KNOWING THE PRINCIPLE<br />OF GOD'S WORK</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:February 22, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Exo. 4:2-9, 17</h1><p>A song of repentance:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;<br />My heart by mighty grace compelled<br />Surrenders all to Thee;<br />Against Thy terrors long I strove,<br />But who can stand against Thy love?<br />Love conquers even me.<br /><br /></li><li>If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,<br />And light'nings flash, to blast my soul,<br />I still had stubborn been;<br />But mercy has my heart subdued,<br />A bleeding Savior I have viewed,<br />And now I hate my sin.<br /><br /></li><li>Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,<br />Come, take possession of Thine own,<br />For Thou hast set me free;<br />Released from Satan's hard command,<br />See all my powers waiting stand,<br />To be employed by Thee.<br /><br />(Hymns, #434)</li></ol><p>This is a hymn of repentance by John Newton. Although some people have used it as a gospel song, it remains a very useful hymn in the congregation of believers.</p><p>Newton was born in 1725 in London, England. His father was a seafaring man and was away from home most of the time. The responsibility of raising the children fell on the shoulders of his devout and loving mother. She always led John by the hand to kneel before God to pray and to consecrate himself to the Lord. She also taught him to read the Bible and to memorize the hymns. At the age of seven, his mother passed away from exhaustion and sickness. Such a blow drove the young man into waywardness. At the age of ten he followed his father and took to the sea. He spent over twenty years as a wandering prodigal. At an early age he adopted a sailor's life of debauchery, drunkenness, and gambling. He heard the gospel many times. Every time he heard it he remembered the face and teaching of his loving mother, and he was pricked in his heart. But he was never able to pull himself out of the sea of iniquity. Later, he went to Africa and engaged in the slave trade. A brawl broke out and resulted in his being sold as a slave instead. He was tormented and harassed. The sufferings in mind and body drove him to become a runaway, but the result was more whipping and imprisonment. A few years later, his father found him and paid a ransom for his release.</p><p>While on a ship on his way back home, he encountered a sudden storm. At that instant, the Lord answered his mother's prayer when she offered him to the Lord as a youth. The battering of the fierce storm warmed his cold heart. The tossing of the waves awakened his slumbering spirit. He recalled the sins and evil he had committed. The stories he heard from his loving mother in his youth about a loving Savior who is God's Beloved flashed back, including stories of the One who had shed His blood and died for him. What grace this was! He could not help but call on the Lord's name aloud. He prayed to God, repented for his sins, believed in the Lord, and accepted Jesus as His Savior. Soon after, he consecrated himself to God and served Him faithfully until he died.</p><p>He wrote many songs. From the many he wrote, we have selected this hymn of repentance. It is one of the best hymns on repentance. Hell and God's punishment may be fearful to others, but they are not fearful to the writer of the song. Even though God can do so much to such a one, He does not threaten men with punishment but compels men to repentance with grace and love. Many people have entered the gate through believing. But Newton did more; he entered the gate through obedience. Paul's repentance was accompanied by humiliation and obedience. The same can be said of Newton. We sing this hymn now whenever someone has some hesitation in consecration.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR GOD'S SERVANT<br />TO KNOW THE LAWS GOVERNING HIS WORK</h2><p>Witness Lee: I feel that as long as Brother Nee is here, I do not have any burden in my spirit. My spirit seems to be resting, sleeping, yet Brother Nee wants me to say something. I guess I have to say something.</p><p>We have to know that God works according to His laws. In order for us who are engaged in His service to be useful, we have to know the laws governing God's work. If we want to become useful in His hand, we have to know the laws governing His work. I have met many brothers and sisters. I cannot say that they have not prayed. Nor can I say that they are lacking in love, godliness, or gifts. They have all these things, but very little of God's work is manifested in them. I feel that there has to be a reason for this. Eventually, I discovered that these ones do not understand the laws governing God's work.</p><p>If I want this room to be filled with sunlight, I should not only open a window that faces north, but windows that face east, south, and west as well. The more windows I open, the more light I will have. On the other hand, if I want light to come in but do not open any window, I can pray all I want for light, but I will not see any result. The same can be said with regard to God's work. We have to work according to God's laws before we can receive His blessing. If we do not work according to His laws, we can pray all we want and be as godly as we want, but nothing will happen. If we have a clear understanding of the laws governing God's work, we will become useful servants in His work. After many years of training, many brothers and sisters have become very clear concerning the laws governing the Lord's work through us. There are at least a few points we must take note of before we can serve Him properly. Of course, we need to know the laws governing His work not only individually but among the co-workers and the church as well.</p><p>Seven or eight years ago, I was meditating one day on this question. I was considering the kind of laws one should know concerning God's work. Strangely enough, during that time of meditation, I seemed to hear a voice saying, "Read Exodus 3 and 4 about Moses' calling and how God used him." Immediately I went to Exodus 3. I did not feel anything dramatic upon reading it. But after reading chapter four, I felt that every sentence burst forth with God's light. I dare not say that I received a great shining, but I dare say that I saw some great principles there.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THREE LESSONS MOSES LEARNED</h2><p>Moses can be considered the model servant of God in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, we can consider Paul the model servant. Both in the Old Testament as well as in the New, Moses was considered faithful in all God's house (Num. 12:7; Heb. 3:2). In terms of spiritual principle, Moses' service as a servant of God has nothing to do with the period in which he lived; it has nothing to do with whether he was in the Old Testament or the New Testament. The principle governing his work is the principle governing the work of all God's servants. We all know the background of Moses. I do not need to repeat it here. He came from an excellent background. He was raised as the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, and he had a heart to serve the Lord. He acquired all the knowledge of Egypt in order to equip himself for the deliverance of God's people. Although God ordained that Moses would be the one to deliver His people Israel out of Egypt into the good land, his desires, knowledge, and eloquence did not qualify him for such service. God had to stir up the environment in a sovereign way to force him to escape to the wilderness in Sinai.</p><p>After Moses was driven to the wilderness, he felt that God had put him aside. During the years he spent in the wilderness, he lost faith in himself (Exo. 3:11; cf. 2:11-13). He admitted that human life is at its end at the age of eighty (Psa. 90:10). It seemed that there was no more time or space before him and that his life would end in the wilderness. Just when he thought that his life was going to be wasted away, God came in and called him in Exodus 3 and 4. When God appeared to him in the burning bush and called him to His work, he considered himself unqualified for any work. He excused himself by saying that he was a man slow in speech. God prepared Aaron and Miriam to be his helpers. But in Exodus 4:1 Moses replied, saying, "They [the Israelites] will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee." This shows that Moses was not yet motivated or convinced. Then God revealed Himself through three miracles. These miracles were the sure proofs that God had called Moses. Moses was told to do three things. In the first act, his rod was turned into a serpent. In the second act, his hand became leprous. In the third act, water was turned into blood (Exo. 4:2-9, 17). The three things&mdash;the rod, the flesh, and the water&mdash;were all useful. But they were turned into three harmful things&mdash;a serpent, leprosy, and blood.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lesson of the Rod Turning into a Serpent</h2><p>Let me first speak on the miracle of the rod turning into a serpent. To Moses, the first function of a rod was for shepherding the flock. Later, it was used for leading the Israelites on in their journey. At that time Moses was eighty years of age. The rod was his support, a necessity for his existence. Although we may not have an actual rod in our hands, we all have something upon which our livelihood depends. A merchant may have his business as a rod. A student may have his studies as a rod. A wife may have her husband as a rod. Our rod is what we depend upon. It is our very support. We have many rods. They may be our parents, education, business, or money. These can be very useful and can be of service to the Lord. But once we touch God, we will see that these rods upon which our livelihood depends must be cast to the ground.</p><p>From my own calling and from the calling of other useful servants of the Lord, I can see that in order for a man to be used by the Lord, he must first cast away the rod he holds in his hand. Once the rod is cast on the ground, the serpent hidden behind the rod is exposed. The serpent is hidden behind the rod all the time. By casting the rod on the ground, the true form of the serpent is exposed. This miracle shows us that under God's shining and the operation of His power, the rod of our support is exposed of its true serpentine nature. The serpent has been coming to us in disguise from the beginning. From the Old Testament until the time of Revelation, the serpent always disguises himself behind, below, or between certain things. His goal is to occupy and usurp the man created for God's own purpose. In Moses' eyes the rod was his support, but in God's eyes it was the embodiment of Satan. Its purpose was to occupy and usurp man.</p><p>When Moses cast the rod down and saw that it had become a serpent, he fled from it. He dared not touch it. God told him to take the serpent by the tail, and the serpent became a rod in his hand once again. Before this time, Moses had been holding that rod for many years. It was something very precious to him. But when he cast it on the ground, he discovered that it was a serpent, something that had occupied him for many years. This experience showed him that his past support was nothing but a serpent, something that was hurting him.</p><p>Please notice that God did not tell Moses to discard the rod, but to cast it on the ground. The purpose of this casting was to reveal the true nature of the rod. Then God told Moses to take the rod, which had become the serpent, by the tail. In Nanking one responsible brother was a businessman. Later he saw the danger of going into business, and he dared not touch it again. But God does not say to discard the rod, but to take it by the tail. We must still have the rod, but we have to take it by the tail. In the past the rod was our center. Today the Lord has to be our center. In the past we struggled for our living. Today we strive for the gospel.</p><p>In the province of Shangtung, an elderly brother once said that his wife, his lifelong companion, was an old serpent, and his children were little serpents. He was ensnared and could not serve the Lord or consecrate himself to the gospel freely. He became afraid of the serpents and dared not take them up by the tail. But the Lord does not tell us to discard the rod and give it up forever. It is easy to drop the rod. It is easy to migrate to northwest China for the gospel and to leave the wife, the children, and all the serpents, large and small, behind. But the Lord does not tell us to do this. Instead, He wants us to put forth our hand and take the serpent by the tail. After the true nature of the hidden serpent is exposed, we have to grab it by the tail. This is the best way to deal with the serpent. If we take a serpent by the head, it will bite us. But if we can turn it around and take it by the tail, it will lose its power and become limp. In the end it will become a channel through which we exercise our authority; it will control us no longer (Exo. 4:4, 17; Luke 10:19). If we cannot take it by the tail, we will not have any authority.</p><p>The four Gospels say that in order to follow the Lord, we have to forsake our parents, children, etc. (Matt. 19:29). In the Epistles, Paul says that we have to love our parents and honor them (Eph. 6:1-3). The forsaking in the Gospels is the casting down of the rod, while the teaching in Ephesians is the taking up of the rod by the tail. This rod becomes the rod of authority. Eventually, Moses performed all the miracles in Egypt and led the children of Israel out of Egypt with this rod.</p><p>Over two hundred brothers and sisters have handed themselves over in the church in Hong Kong. The first lesson you have to learn is to cast all that you have and all your support on the ground and then take it by the tail.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lesson of Knowing the Self</h2><p>Following this, God told Moses to put his hand into his bosom. He put it in his bosom, and when he took it out, it was leprous as snow. This is the second lesson. First, we have to cast the rod in our hand on the ground to expose the true face of the serpent and then take it by the tail. Then we have to do a second thing. It is not enough for us to follow Moses in casting down our rod. We need a second lesson, which is to follow Moses in putting our hand into our bosom. When we take out our hand, it becomes leprous. The bosom signifies what we are in our inward parts. Leprosy signifies our sin (Rom. 7:17-18). This tells us that there is no goodness within ourselves. We have to see that we have nothing and are nothing. In the church I see many brothers and sisters who criticize, judge, and complain. I am quite angry at this. I believe these brothers and sisters do not realize that leprosy is hidden in their bosom. If we know our flesh, we will not dare criticize the brothers, even when we feel the urge to do so. We know our own leprosy. We know that people of the same kind congregate together, that we are the same as they, and that we are equally unclean within ourselves.</p><p>As long as our praise, love, and sympathy come from ourselves, they are leprous. Newton's hymn says that he hated his sin. Once a man sees himself and knows himself, he will not dare criticize others easily. He will see that he is not qualified to criticize others. The Lord forgives me for saying this: Every time I want to say something about my brothers and sisters, the Lord shows me my own leprosy, my uncleanness, and my defilement. No matter how wrong the brothers and sisters are and how hurt I have been, I dare not criticize. There is nothing within me that qualifies me for the Lord's calling. It is the grace of God that makes me what I am (1 Cor. 15:10). If I know myself this way, I will put up no resistance and will humble myself. This will remove the leprosy from among God's children. We should not be dissatisfied with anyone. We should only hate ourselves. Those who see a clear picture of themselves will realize that they are but a heap of dirt, trash, corruption, and filth. They are nothing but the embodiment of sin. Except for the mercy of God, they are not worthy to work for Him. Once we see this, we will have many confessions and prayers.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lesson of Knowing the World</h2><p>In order to know God's work, not only must we know the usurpation of Satan and the corruption of our own flesh, but we must also know the evil of the world. The third miracle that God showed Moses was this: "Take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land" (Exo. 4:9). The river refers to the Nile which irrigates the entire land of Egypt. It signifies the fallen worldly enjoyment. Egypt is a type of the world. According to the Bible, Egypt was rich with produce and enjoyed its abundance through the supply of the river Nile. The Nile was the very life and life supply of Egypt. Blood is a sign of death. On the surface the Nile brings supply and enjoyment. But in God's eyes it is death. The world may enjoy its abundance and excellence, and we may be poor, stricken, and destitute. We may see our classmates prospering. They might not have done so well in school, yet today they are enjoying everything. This makes our pain all the more acute. But once we see the water turning into blood, we will realize that man's enjoyment of everything&mdash;houses, cars, etc.&mdash;is but the drinking of blood.</p><p>Once we see that our support is a serpent, that there is nothing but uncleanness within us, and that everything is blood, we will no longer remain in delusion. The Lord said that only the water that He gives will make men thirst no more (John 4:14). A thirsty man will never be satisfied with the water of this world. Only the water that the Lord gives will quench man's thirst, and only this water will meet the needs of our work for the Lord. May we remember these three principles.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE MUST HAVE REVELATION BEFORE HE CAN WORK</h2><p>Watchman Nee: The above three basic lessons can be summarized under one basic principle&mdash;seeing. Once a man sees, he will spontaneously be separated. Without God's revelation, we will only see the rod, we will see that our hands are clean, and we will regard the supply of Egypt as nothing but river water. But once we have God's revelation, we will not feel the same. We will see that the rod in our hand is a serpent, that our hands are not clean, and that the world is full of death.</p><p>Exodus 4 is a chapter of contrast between God's revelation and man's view. Many people have asked me, "How can I have God's revelation?" This is a matter of whether or not you have seen that the rod is a serpent, that there is leprosy in your hand, and that the water is blood. Young people have ambitious dreams. I hope that you can wake up from your beautiful dreams. God not only commanded Moses to see and perform these miracles, but to go to the Israelites and perform the same. God's intention was for Moses to bring deliverance to the Israelites. This was an impossible task to Moses. But once he received God's revelation, his feeling changed. Suppose there is a worm at the bottom of this cup. Being thirsty, I drink from this cup. When I get to the bottom of the cup, however, I see the worm. When I want to drink again, what will I feel when I see the cup? I am afraid I will have the "feeling" of the worm inside me. This is what revelation will do to us. Originally, I had no feeling about a certain thing. Moses did not have any feeling about his rod before the miracle. But after it was turned into a serpent, his feeling about the rod changed.</p><p>We can say the same thing about our feeling for the flesh. We have to know that sin is not only in the world but also in us. Violence is not only in the world but also in us. In the past we did not have this feeling. One day we took our hand out from our bosom, and we discovered that we were leprous. From that day onward, every time we stretched forth our hand, we would think of leprosy. Some people pretend to be humble, weak, and obedient. But their performance is artificial. If a man does not have revelation, he can be humble only when he consciously acts this way. But once he forgets to act, he is no longer humble. He has to be on guard all the time. When we speak a word of exhortation or rebuke, we have to realize that the words from "our bosom" may be leprous. Please remember that the Lord did not call us to the work based on how much we have handed ourselves over, but based on how much revelation we have received. A brother once said to me, "Even if I am weaker than I once was, I am still stronger than those two brothers." I am afraid he has never seen his own depravity.</p><p>A servant of the Lord must also have a feeling for the water of the world. The quenching of thirst is for the purpose of satisfying our need. Perhaps some of us have been praying for years for a worldly position or blessings. I hope we will have a burning revelation from God to see that every fulfillment from the world is nothing but blood. In the eyes of those who have revelation, water is nothing but blood. It is possible to have water turned into blood even in such minute details as shopping for towels and socks. If we want to serve the Lord, we should not remain in Egypt and drink the water of the Nile. We should instead go into the wilderness to drink of the flowing water from the rock.</p><p>Here we all have to see what we did not see previously. All those who have received a revelation will say that they have witnessed something mysterious. To man, it is a rod, a hand from the bosom, or water from the Nile. But once we have God's revelation and vision, we will know the true nature of things, and we will see that they are a serpent, the flesh, and blood. We will run away from them. We will be afraid and shrink back. Only God's revelation will give us the true knowledge of the things that we put our trust in. Only God's revelation will show us that our greatest sin is the self, and only His revelation will show us the evil of this world. In the world a rod is something to rely on, the self is good, and the water is drinkable. But I would join Brother Lee to implore you to receive a clear revelation from God. You have to see the world, the self, and the true picture of everything around you. Only then will you be able to work for God, and only then will you be acceptable to Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE CHRISTIAN PATHWAY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Evening, February 23, 1950<br />Place: Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers: Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">KEEPING ONE'S SECRET COVENANT BEFORE THE LORD</h2><p>Watchman Nee: When John Wesley married in his twenties, he made a secret covenant with the Lord. This was the only time he adjusted the standard of his living. (Before he was married, he was called to the Lord's work. Later, he went full-time to serve the Lord.) From that time until his death, he never changed the standard of his living. After his death, others listed his income. His earning in later years did increase. Every year he earned ten to twenty thousand pounds. (Both he and his brother Charles were songwriters, and they had income from royalties.) The year before he died he earned the most&mdash;over twenty thousand pounds. But he maintained the same standard of living throughout. All of his excess was spent on the gospel, on literature, and on tracts. He also offered what he had for the Lord's work by training more people and sending them out for the Lord.</p><p>All the brothers and sisters who are in business, who hold jobs, or who are housewives at home should have a list. They have to make a vow before the Lord as to the standard of living they want to maintain. Once they have set the standard, they have to maintain it with an unfeigned conscience. They should not regret later and say, "I cannot make it. I do not have the faith or the resources, etc." Not only must the husband and the wife discuss among themselves, but the two must go to the Lord together to seek His will and to make a covenant with Him. One brother in Fukien has set a limit of four dollars per month for himself. Many brothers have praised him for this, but I say that this was wrong. There is no need to mortify ourselves or purposely starve or freeze ourselves to death. If this brother continues this way, he will get sick one day and have to spend even more money on himself. Many brothers and sisters are very smart when it comes to their money. They are very clever, but they do not understand a thing about spiritual matters. Some people have no spiritual understanding before they consecrate themselves. But once they hand themselves over, their spiritual understanding is enlightened. Therefore, we should not underestimate the practice of a secret covenant before the Lord.</p><p>To the world, forsaking everything to follow the Lord is a reckless act. But this is only one small part of a Christian's overall service to God. Our career, body, time, and future must also be consecrated. We will not make public the lists that the brothers and sisters have handed over to us. They are a means for the responsible brothers to get to know you and render proper help to you. Some people may be offering too little. Others may be offering too much. The responsible brothers can render help according to your list.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REAL CHRISTIAN STANDARD&mdash;<br />WALKING ACCORDING TO<br />THE DEMAND OF CHRIST WITHIN</h2><p>Witness Lee: I have often thought that God's love is very much misunderstood by man, but Christianity is also very much misunderstood by man. In the Bible there is no such term as Christianity. The Bible only says that individual believers are Christians, and the whole Body of believers is the church. There is no such term as Christianity. A Christian is one who believes in the Lord and who possesses His life. Many brothers and sisters have become Christians, but they do not know what it means to be a Christian. If we ask a Christian what a Christian is, many will give strange answers. Someone may answer, "As long as a man has Christ and His life, he is a Christian." Even this answer is not easy to comprehend. We may say this with our mouth, but we are not this kind of person. One day when God opens our eyes, we will know what a Christian is. Today it is as rare to find a person who knows what a Christian is as it is to find the morning star.</p><p>What is a Christian in man's concept and view? Some think that a Christian is one who follows the teachings and creeds of Christianity, attends Sunday morning service, and tithes. Strictly speaking, being a Christian has nothing to do with these outward things. Christianity is not a religion or a teaching based on the Bible; it is not to zealously practice teachings that are based on the Bible. Christians are those who pay attention to the inward things. They pay attention to the things that are in Christ. A Christian is one who is in Christ. This may sound objective, abstract, or general. Let me put it another way. A Christian is one in whom Christ dwells. Today you are a Christian. On what standard do you practice your Christian life? Does Christian conduct consist solely of keeping ordinances? Is his standard merely the Bible? We have to say, "No." Let me ask Miss Nee, "Do you take the teachings, slogans, and beliefs of No. 7, Jordan Road as your standard of Christian life?" (She shakes her head.) Brother Ma, what would you say? (Brother Weigh answers, "According to the demand of the Christ within us.") There are two answers. One is to act according to the teachings of the Bible. The other is to act according to the sense of the inward leading of the Holy Spirit. Some say that a Christian is one who imitates Christ, but it is not easy to imitate Christ. It is not a matter of seeing Christ jump in front of us and copying Him. The genuine experience of a Christian is not outward; it comes from within. Although we may have outward activities occasionally, the source of these activities must come from within.</p><h2 class="head2">Consecration Being a Demand of Life within Us</h2><p>Let me ask Brother Chia why he consecrated himself. (He answers, "Because I love to do it inwardly. This is like a child loving chocolate.") Let me ask you why you love to do it. (He answers, "Because the life within me loves to do it.") That is right. We consecrate ourselves because the life within us loves to do it. When we do it, inwardly we feel happy and joyful. In 1943 we witnessed the tide of handing oneself over in Chefoo. At the end of the previous year, I saw clearly that the matter of money must be settled within God's children. Unless this matter was settled, it would have been impossible for God's gospel to spread, and there would have been no way for the brothers and sisters to have a genuine revival. On December 12, 1942, the Lord did a marvelous work in Chefoo. That afternoon I gave a message on consecration. From that time onward, the Lord began to inwardly touch the brothers and sisters to consecrate their all. This lasted for three and a half months. Six to seven hundred people consecrated their all to the Lord. Some handed themselves over to be sent out for migration. All the brothers and sisters were swept away by this revival. Many people dared not touch their garments when they went home for fear that the Lord would ask them to offer them up as soon as they touched them. The brothers and sisters handed themselves over because they wanted the inward peace. If they had not handed themselves over, they would not have had the peace. The same thing happened in Foochow in 1948. All the brothers and sisters handed themselves over as a result of answering the call of the life within them.</p><p>I can give a little testimony of my own. Twenty-three years ago in 1928, I was still a young man in my twenties. I often went to the mountains and the wilderness and shouted to the Lord that I would consecrate everything to Him. In 1933 the Lord came to me and actually touched me to consecrate myself for His work. I struggled and reasoned with the Lord, but He only answered me with His presence. On the day I agreed to give up my job, many tears poured out from my being. I knelt before the Lord and told Him that I was willing to drop everything and to give it all up to Him. The Lord's name became very sweet and rich to my mouth. Inwardly I was filled with joy. I felt that nothing could stop me from giving my all to the Lord. The sense of joy, release, and relief at that time was heavenly. I cannot describe that feeling even today. In short, I felt happy and right when I did it. I had never heard a message about handing over everything and forsaking all to follow the Lord, but when I obeyed the inward demand, I forsook everything spontaneously. In the same way, if we are living the life of Christ, the very mention of "handing over" will "bankrupt" us. Yet we will feel inwardly relieved, because we have answered such an inward call.</p><h2 class="head2">Being an Inwardly Happy Christian</h2><p>Let me ask you another question: "Why do you want to be a Christian?" (Brother Ma answers, "If I were not a Christian, I would not be happy.") But my answer is that I am a Christian because I want to be inwardly happy. If I become a Christian merely because I want to go to heaven or to be forgiven of my sins, I cannot be a thoroughly happy Christian. In order to be a happy Christian, we have to be resolute and absolute. Unless we forsake everything to follow the Lord, we will not feel inwardly happy and elated. What an inward relief we have when we drop everything!</p><p>Madame Guyon was willing to forgo all her possessions and forsake everything to please the Lord who lived within her. Even her beauty was stripped away by the Lord. To man she was a pitiable sight, but within her was indescribable joy. Count Zinzendorf, George Muller, and Saint Francis of Assisi all lived their lives this way. They were willing to drop everything to follow the Lord. As a result, they all satisfied the inward demand and achieved inward peace. The word forsake means to let go. This shows us how severe Christ's demand within us is.</p><p>May we all yield to the demand of the life within us. It is not enough for a Christian to merely keep biblical truths and ordinances, practice Christian virtues, or be zealous for the Lord. If we are zealous for the Lord yet not inwardly happy, or if we are ardent yet do not feel the sweetness, there is something wrong with us as Christians. It is wrong for a Christian to not feel sweet, happy, or relieved. If a Christian acts properly, morally, sinlessly, and humbly, yet does not taste any freshness, sweetness, and joy, his problem is not with sin but with the fact that he has not answered Christ's inward call. The power of preaching the gospel comes naturally from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. But a greater power comes from answering Christ's call. A man who forsakes everything is powerful in the gospel. The amount we forsake determines the amount of power of the Spirit we possess. If a Christian is dull towards spiritual things, it is because he cannot get through in this matter. He is probably reluctant to let go of certain things or too fond of certain items. If a man is slow or dull in his spiritual feelings, he must have a problem with his forsaking. The more we mean business with the Lord in following Him, the more we will answer His demand within us.</p><p>A Christian may not appear to have any problems outwardly. However, if he does not shine inwardly, is slow to react, or is not happy, he must have some problems. A piano may look good from the outside, but if its strings are not properly calibrated, the sounds it produces will be out of tune. The only reason that a Christian is dull in his feelings is because he has not answered Christ's demand within. If we feel that we are bound, that our fellowship with the brothers and sisters is blocked, and that the supply of the brothers and sisters produces little effect in us, we do not have to think of things we have to do for the Lord. All we need to do is ask what things we have to drop. Once we drop them, we will meet the Lord's demand. The things that we cannot drop are the very things that bear down on us. If a Christian feels dark, stifled, sour, or dull, it is because he has not answered Christ's call within.</p><p>We should not think that all of Christ's sayings in the Gospels were outward demands. They are actually His speaking and demands within us. All the requirements of Matthew 5&mdash;7 are Christ's demands within us. I do not believe a man can come to the Lord without touching His demands. All of the words spoken by Christ in the Gospels are His demands within us. If we answer His first demand, that is not enough. He will give us more demands. Like the young man who told the Lord that he had kept all the commandments, the Lord will always answer by saying, "Still you lack one thing" (Luke 18:22).</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEMAND OF CHRIST<br />BEING THE SUPPLY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Some may say that a person as demanding as Christ is too hard to approach. But once we answer His demand, we will feel refreshed and happy within. Whenever we feel that Christ has a demand within us and we answer this demand, we will feel happy. When He demands, He also supplies. Only such ones can testify of and share Christ's riches, transcendence, and excellence. The Christian life should be like a piano; the important thing is not how it looks outwardly but whether or not it plays the right tune. (I am not saying this to encourage you to be loose in the outward things.)</p><p>I hope that more brothers and sisters can be raised up to touch Christ's inward demands. Some brothers and sisters have heard messages concerning consecration and the handing over of one's all. They may have witnessed the burning consecration and handing over of the other brothers and sisters, and they may have decided to follow suit and do the same. However, it is not enough for them to be zealous, to consecrate themselves, and to hand themselves over. Their consecration and handing over must issue from a genuine demand within. Handing over enables us to become sensitive to the Lord's demands; it also enables us to enjoy the precious Lord in a richer way.</p><p>Once we meet the Lord's demand in an absolute way, we will find His demands easy and light. If we only partially answer it, we will find it hard to fulfill. It is very difficult to answer sixty or seventy percent of the Lord's call. But it is easy to answer one hundred percent of His calling. If a man does not answer His call, he will not be happy. If he answers His call only halfway, he will be even less happy. If he answers His call reluctantly, he will find himself struggling. Only those who lay everything on the altar receive the most abundant joy and supply. Today we should only worry about not answering His call enough. It is hard for a Christian to go on if he drags his feet. May the Lord be merciful to us. May we be clear that the Christian pathway today has everything to do with Christ within us. We should follow Christ; we should answer His demand within. This is our way to serve. This is the way of life. Let me repeat: We judge our Christian life by the sense of strength, sweetness, comfort, clarity, and light.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OUR FAILURE<br />TO ANSWER THE LORD'S DEMAND</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Today we can find two kinds of brothers and sisters in the church. Many brothers and sisters are happy, but a few are sad. Perhaps you can find both kinds of Christians sitting right beside you. If I were to ask you to nominate the happiest people here, the ones who have no problems would surely say that they are the ones. If anyone is not happy and if anyone has doubts about himself, surely he must have some kind of problem, some kind of spiritual sickness. The main reason for this sickness is that the Lord has a demand that has not been answered. This is a matter of experience; it is not a matter of doctrine. If you say, "Before you two brothers spoke, I was quite happy. Now your speaking has taken away my happiness," this is because our message conveys the demand of Christ. If a Christian does not answer this demand, he will be sad. Our doctrine, speaking, and exhortation do not serve the basic need. Our voice is like the sound from the loudspeakers; we only amplify the demand of Christ within and make it clearer.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TODAY BEING TO OBEY THE INNER VOICE</h2><p>If the brothers and sisters hear this voice but are reluctant to answer the Lord's call, then I can only say that it is too late. If you do not want to be a Christian, it is better that you never started. Today the life of Christ is in you; it is impossible for you to no longer be a Christian. Since you are a Christian, you should resolve within to follow the brothers. Why can you not answer the call of the Lord's great love? For many years, you have quenched, suppressed, and limited the inner voice with money, the world, and worries. None of our teachings are new doctrines in these days. We are merely telling you what you should be hearing every day. We are not speaking fresh words here, and we have no interest to speak anything special. We are telling you the facts. The more things a Christian holds in his hand, the more he suffers. In the end he will be like the young ruler, going away in sorrow. If you forsake everything, however, you will rejoice like Zaccheus and experience salvation (Luke 18:1-9).</p><p>If an unbeliever is brought here and hears such a word, he will surely go away, saying, "These speakers must have something wrong in their mind. How can they ask anyone to give up everything?" When unbelievers hear such a word, they will not be pricked; some may even consider our words to be a kind of joke. Only those who truly have Christ in them as life will know the meaning of our word. To be a Christian, we have to be one in such a reckless way; we have to take such a reckless pathway. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would see the Christian pathway now.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE WHOLE CHURCH SERVING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Evening, February 24, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Eph. 4:11-12, 16</h1><h2 class="head1">EXPLANATION OF A HYMN</h2><p>Watchman Nee: What is a hymn? A hymn is the expression of a person's spiritual sentiments. When a man expresses his spiritual sentiments in songs, many times his mind is not very clear, but his spirit is clear. For example in Hymns, #974, it is unclear whether the "he" refers to the Lord, to Abraham, or to us. They are all mixed together. Whatever it may be, we can touch the spirit of this hymn.</p><h2 class="head1">HANDING OVER TO RUN THE CHRISTIAN RACE</h2><p>After you have believed in the Lord, you have to deal with two things. The first is sin. Formerly, sin followed and entangled you. You were not able to free yourself from sin. Once you believed in the Lord, your sinful acts were forgiven. Now you must also deal with sin itself so that you can be free from its domination. The second category includes things that should be terminated. You have to deal with all the things you have acquired from the world. Some of these things relate to sin. Others are not related to sin, but are a burden and hindrance to running the Christian race. All these have to be dealt with and cleared up. Hebrews 12:1-2 says that in running the race, a Christian must first put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles him. No one runs a race wearing an overcoat and dress shoes. No one runs with things in his hands. In the same way, after a man believes in the Lord, he has to sell everything, forsake all, and remove every hindrance to run the race before him.</p><p>How do we deal with the things that are still in our hands? When men went to John the Baptist to ask what they should do, he replied, "He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise" (Luke 3:11). Anything that we owe others should be returned with recompense. If we have acquired our fortune by unjust means, it is wrong to keep it. It is equally wrong to spend it. We have to deal with it in a clear way. Everything that we own and everything in our house must be dealt with and cleaned up thoroughly. If a Christian wants to run the race before him, he has to deal immediately with the many burdens that entangle him. Forsaking everything is not only an expression of our love for the Lord; it is mainly for the purpose of preparing us to run our Christian race properly.</p><p>We know that a man cannot be a Christian if sin remains in him. But if many material things remain in him, he cannot be a Christian either. Sin in us will hinder us from living a proper Christian life. In principle, material things remaining with us also will hinder us from living a proper Christian life. Sin makes us sick organically; material things make us sick functionally.</p><p>Things that the brothers and sisters own, such as gold, silver, precious items, jewelry, etc., must be handed over. Concerning the lands and houses that the saints have handed over, there should be suitable arrangements and proper disposition. Many Christians have lived loosely and carelessly in the past. Today they can no longer be so reckless. In these days, the brothers and sisters must be very busy. We all must learn to be absolute and strict Christians.</p><p>We believe that the church is beginning to take the final step of God's recovery. May we do well in this way. Thank the Lord that He has put us in this rich age.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEMAND OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST WITHIN&mdash;<br />THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><p>Witness Lee: Ephesians 4:11-16 is on the building up of the Body of Christ. Verse 12 says that all the gifts should be unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. Verse 16 follows by saying that all the members, joined and knit together through every joint of the rich supply, cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. First, the building is carried out by the gifts given by Christ. Then the building is carried out by the members functioning together. A Christian is a person with Christ in him, living in him and abiding in him. Since Christ is in us, He has demands. He has demands because He is living in us. What is the church? Many people say that the church is the totality of the believers. This is much better than those who say that the church is a building with towers and crosses. More accurately, the church is the Christ living within me plus the Christ living within you, plus the Christ living within all the other members. An individual Christian is not the church. Since God became flesh, we have Christ. This Christ entered into many people. When we add up the Christ within you, me, and many others, we have the church. We are not saying that the sum total of these people is the church. We are saying that the Christ within these people added together is the church. An individual Christ is not the church. The church is the corporate Christ.</p><p>Let me ask another question: What is the service of the church? In Taipei a brother who has been fellowshipping with me for many years told me once that he was very unhappy about the fact that we are so opposed to the denominations in their election of elders and deacons. We have to realize that such a denominational system is absolutely different from our kind of arrangement and coordination. Our coordination spontaneously issues from the functioning of the life of Christ. It is produced by the demand of Christ who lives within all the brothers and sisters. Christ in the church is its service. Every saved believer can serve according to the life he has received from Christ. Christ is life within us. As we give more ground to Him, we are delivered from many sinful and worldly things on the one hand, and we participate in more service on the other hand.</p><p>The life which we have received is the life of the Body of Christ. In my body the blood in any member is as good as the blood in the whole body, because all the members have inherited the same life of the body. In the same way, the life within us is the life of the church. From 1934, we began to see clearly that Christ is our life; that is, He is our life in service. If a young sister loves her dresses more than the Lord, her desire for serving the Lord will spontaneously be reduced. No Christian can say that he is free from the love of the world, sin, and the flesh, and yet have no burden for man's soul; he is only waiting to go to heaven. Once a man drops the world, surely he will serve. The more the life of Christ functions within us, the more we will serve.</p><p>Christ within us is life, and Christ within the church is service. For the past few days I have been quite pressed. In Hong Kong there are about two hundred brothers and sisters who have received our fellowship and who have handed themselves over. I felt pressed because I asked myself why these ones were not serving yet. We have been listening to messages for over ten days, and we still want to go on listening. But those who have handed themselves over always have an urgent need in life to serve. This feeling is right and precious. This is the reason we have elders and deacons to make arrangements in the services. These ones, however, are not produced through election. The urge within everyone for service creates these needs. An elder does not take it upon himself to be an elder; he is appointed by the Holy Spirit (Acts 20:28). As the book of Hebrews says, the high priest in the Old Testament did not take the honor upon himself to be the high priest; he was called by God (5:4). The source, basis, and nature of our arrangements are different from the way of organization in the denominations. We are not a human organization; we are members in the Body. Everyone coordinates together by spontaneous arrangement, not by human organization.</p><p>I will summarize the above words in this way: The Christ within us is not just our life. This life has its demands. Once we answer the demand of this Christ within us, we will be led to serve Him. Moreover, we will not serve Him individually, but in coordination in the church as the Body. We must pay attention to more than just answering the demand of Christ within us. We must see that this demand leads the whole Body to serve in coordination. The more we answer Christ's demand within us and coordinate with the brothers and sisters, the more comfortable we will be. If a Christian forsakes his money, career, and future but does not serve in coordination in the church, he will not have peace and joy.</p><p>If we pay attention to Christ's demand within us, we will realize that this Christ is leading us to the service of the church. If a man is not saved, he does not have the life of Christ within him. Therefore, an unsaved person does not have a heart to serve the Lord. But a Christian who has Christ's life within him always has a heart to serve God, even if he has fallen miserably into the world. The responsible brothers in the church must treasure this desire for service within the brothers and sisters. The church must discover and stir up this desire. If a church cannot help its brothers and sisters to rise up to serve, it is a sick church. The church is the aggregate of the life of Christ within the brothers and sisters. This is the Body of Christ. The life of Christ within everyone spontaneously demands that we serve. If a church does not take the lead and render the help to the brothers and sisters to serve the Lord, it is a sick church. This is like the life in a physical body. Under normal circumstances, it has to work and exercise. Other than when it lays down to rest, the body has many activities. If a church does not work or serve, it is sick.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT GOD IS AFTER TODAY&mdash;<br />A TESTIMONY OF THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><p>Why did we leave the denominations in the first place? We left them because we felt that our need for serving the Lord was not met. God wants the whole church to rise up to serve Him. God has put such a desire within every brother and sister. Therefore, the responsible brothers in the church must pay attention to this matter. If we frustrate and stop the brothers and sisters from serving, we are offending the Holy Spirit. This is a very serious thing. This is true not only for the testimony of the Body in one locality but also for the testimony of the Body in the universal church. If the entire church in Hong Kong does not rise up to serve now, one day the tide of universal service will sweep to Hong Kong. You will be forced to take the way of universal service. What is the preaching of the gospel? What is edification and visitation? It is the actual carrying out of the universal service of the whole church.</p><p>A church must arrive at Ephesians 4. It must not only have the first kind of service&mdash;that of the gifts&mdash;but the second kind of service as well&mdash;that of the functioning of all the members. If there is only the first kind of service, the building of the Body is not complete. The first kind of service through the gifts is the initiation. The second kind of service through all the members is the universal service of the entire church. If every member in the church rises up to serve, there will be a very sweet testimony of oneness in the church.</p><p>Please forgive me for mentioning something related to myself. My son is about twenty years old. One day he asked me, "Why are you so busy? Other preachers and pastors are very free. Why are you so busy, not only in the church, but at home as well?" I answered by telling him about the demand of the life within us. I have to shout at the top of my voice today: I wish I could have twenty lives to go to all the churches to coordinate and serve with all the brothers and sisters. Within me I feel that this is the sweetest employment on earth.</p><p>Let me ask Brother Hsia: "Would you like to be a king today?" I believe we would consider this a most glorious calling. If we are given the chance to be a king on earth, we would feel very honored and privileged. But today we are called to serve our God! Once we touch the service of the church, we touch heaven, and we have the presence of God. We must allow that serving spirit to come out of us. We must allow the serving life within us to have an outlet, to break through our own limitations, and to serve freely. The church service is a service in which Christ flows out of our being. Once God moves in the church, there is service. Once we see God working in the brothers and sisters and in the church, we have to be prepared; the universal service is just around the corner. When the Holy Spirit operates within the saints, their service will be like the moving of mighty winds and billowing waves; nothing will stop it. Therefore, if we ignore the Body coordination and service in the church, we bear a great responsibility. The greater the coordination, the more manifestation of the Body testimony there will be. The deeper and more thorough this coordination develops, the more God's glory will be expressed. We have to pay attention to all the responsibilities that the brothers and sisters are able to bear, whether they are great or small. We have to follow them up, give them a free hand to serve, watch over them, and help them to serve. We should never frustrate them, stop them, or replace them. If we are faithful to practice this, God will have a way. Otherwise, I am afraid we will be a hindrance to hundreds of souls in their salvation. If we go along with God's flow, it will be very easy for men to be saved. We must not only urge and remind the brothers and sisters to go on, but we must learn to usher them into the service. Personally, I feel that if the heart to serve in all the brothers and sisters is stirred up and if the whole church rises up to serve, it will not be hard to gain a thousand souls by the end of this year. We can neglect many things, but we can never offend the serving spirit of the saints. If my words are too strong, please forgive me.</p><p>Let me give another testimony. On April 15, 1942, I went to Tsingtao from Chefoo for some meetings. At that time I asked how many brothers and sisters were in fellowship with us there. Seventy to eighty were in attendance. I then asked how many saints were in the entire church. I was told that there were a little over one hundred thirty. We met that day until the evening. All the co-workers and responsible brothers and sisters were brought into one accord. No one had any resistance in his spirit concerning the service of the church. At that time we had not baptized a single person. But by June 15, two hundred people were baptized in Tsingtao alone. By the end of the year, the number increased to six hundred. In 1943 the number increased to over a thousand. Because of the invasion of the Japanese, the meetings were stopped, and saints began to meet in the homes. By 1950 there were over three thousand saints in Tsingtao. Later, the brothers and sisters from Tsinan visited Tsingtao. They saw the situation. There was resistance among them because they did not have the same spirit of one accord, and the spirit of service could not get through in Tsinan. Even now the number in Tsinan is still under five hundred. The brothers and sisters from Tsinan did not express any opposition outwardly, but they did not agree with the practice in Tsingtao in reality. For this reason, the church did not get the blessing. We cannot offend the Holy Spirit. In order for the service to grow and expand, we must never offend the serving spirit in the church. If we offend the serving spirit in the church, we offend the Body of Christ. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT OFFENDING THE CHRIST WITHIN THE CHURCH</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Time is almost up. I will only say a few short words. The offenses God's children commit against the Christ in them are much less than the offenses they commit against the Christ in the church. It is easy for a Christian to be recovered if he offends the Christ within him, but it is not as easy to be recovered if he offends the Christ in the church. I say this because these two things are basically different. If we offend the Christ within us, we have not touched God's plan in this age. This is the reason it is easy to be recovered. But if a man offends the Christ in the church, he has offended God's plan of administration in that age. This is a serious thing. The damage is great. It may frustrate the salvation of many souls. Let me say this to the responsible brothers and especially to the elders: We can never offend the Christ in the church.</p><p>If we offend the Christ in the church, on the one hand, we close the door to God's gospel. On the other hand, we frustrate those whom God may possibly use in a great way. We block the gospel and annul the gifts in the church. Therefore, we must never offend the Christ in the church. This is a very serious matter. We must have a godly fear and understand that it is a grave matter to block Christ's way within the church.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Brother Bau: Lord, be particularly merciful to us. Every one of us has Your life, and every one of us has a desire to serve. Without service, there is no manifestation of the life of Christ in the church. Lord, draw us so that we will consecrate ourselves to You once again. We want You to have a clear way in the church through our service. Lord, may You express Your glory through the church, and may You work through the church. Be gracious to us. May none of us be a hindrance to You. Be merciful to the church in Hong Kong. Be merciful to us. We admit that we are useless servants. We are prepared to go on with Your present flow today. Lord, may You gain the full glory.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Lord, we give ourselves to You. Grant us no peace within when our spirit is dull. Whenever we are wrong, may we sense death. May our mind, spirit, emotion, and will be completely open to You. May You gain a free way within us. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(5)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Morning, February 25 (?), 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF HOME MEETINGS<br />AND THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THESE MEETINGS</h2><p>Watchman Nee: I would like to say something about the meetings of the church in the homes. Suitable homes should be located within each district for conducting these meetings. Meeting in the homes is a practice recorded in the Bible. When Peter was in prison, the church prayed earnestly for him (Acts 12:5). At that time the number in the entire church in Jerusalem was very big. They did not gather in one place to pray but prayed in the homes. When Peter came out of prison, he had to "consider" (12:12, KJV) which home he should go to before proceeding to the house of Mary the mother of Mark. Many were gathered together to pray there. This shows that there were many homes that he could go to at that time. This is the reason Peter had to consider before deciding which house to go to.</p><p>At Pentecost over three thousand people were saved. Day by day, they continued steadfastly with one accord in the temple and broke bread from house to house (Acts 2:46). Due to their great number, the believers met regularly from house to house. They met in the temple only when they all needed to gather together. Other than these times, the brothers and sisters assembled in different homes.</p><p>Of course, we have to be on the alert that our next generation does not make the district subdivision a tradition. When this happens, it will be difficult to change things around again. All the brothers have to act according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. There should not be any set form. A district meeting can have fifty people or a hundred people. Such a division is convenient, but this is not a legal number. We are merely saying that fifty or a hundred is a convenient number. The Lord did not feed the multitude by dividing them all into groups of fifty or all into groups of a hundred. Rather, there were groups of fifty and there were groups of a hundred. This shows us that the Lord was merely supplying a convenient number. Based on this principle we should have some arrangements. When the number becomes big, we should subdivide into districts. There can be fifty to a district or a hundred to a district. Such meetings are very convenient because the number is small, and it is easy to care for and visit everyone. It affords more opportunities for everyone to function in the meetings. The advantage of the home meetings is that they give more opportunities for the brothers and sisters to open their mouths to speak (cf. 1 Cor. 14:31).</p><p>A few days ago we announced that the bread-breaking meeting would be conducted in five districts or "homes" [Translator's Note: home is another term for "district" in the usage at that time.] Now we want to increase that to six districts.</p><p>The main responsibility of the elders is to oversee. They should all be headed up by Brother Witness. Together they should oversee the entire church in Hong Kong. The leadership in the various districts is: Chu Zhi-yuen for the Jordan Road meeting hall, Hsu Jin-ching for Hsu's home, Cheng Him-yuen for Bao's home, Chan Shi-re for Chan's home, and K. H. Weigh for Shen's home.</p><h2 class="head1">A FELLOWSHIP<br />FOR ALL THE "HOME" RESPONSIBLE ONES</h2><p>Witness Lee: I have a word of fellowship for all the "home" responsible ones. Concerning the practical affairs in the districts, such as the preparation for the meeting facilities, the arrangements before and after the meetings, the supply of drinks, etc., we should not overburden the hosts of the homes where the meetings are held. Instead, we should share the work by assigning different brothers and sisters to do the various jobs. We have to identify the various responsibilities and come up with proper ways to discharge them. Do not wait for the hosts to ask about them and do not overburden them. From today forward, the works in the "homes" are officially passed on to the various districts. We have to write down everything we need to do and should not allow anything to slip through our fingers.</p><p>Do not try to be too spiritual in conducting the meetings. Do not try to be non-spiritual either. On the one hand, we have to function aggressively and positively. On the other hand, we have to touch the flow of the Holy Spirit. Conduct everything in an orderly way in spirit, following the Spirit's leading in such a way as if being borne on the wings of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ATTITUDE IN A MEETING</h2><h2 class="head2">Knowing the Lord's Will</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Before every meeting, the responsible brothers must come together to open their hearts to the Lord. You have to ask the Lord together: "What do You want to achieve in tonight's meeting?" In every meeting the Lord goes on. He has a purpose. Do not take anything for granted. Do not think that since the meetings are regular, one can be loose. Brother Weigh plays tennis. Surely he does not make his plan at the last minute before the game. He has to consider beforehand. The same is true with spiritual things. We cannot meet in a routine way or leave things to chance. We have to learn to touch the Spirit of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Exercising Human Hands Too Much</h2><p>The responsible ones should not take the attitude of a spectator; they should not sit back and watch what the brothers and sisters are doing. The responsible brothers cannot be passive. They must be active. Their heart must be open to the Lord. In leading the saints on, they should not exercise human hands too much. They should not monopolize everything. They should learn to wait and give the Holy Spirit the opportunity to inwardly lead the saints.</p><h2 class="head2">Believing in the Holy Spirit<br />and Touching the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The responsible ones should also believe that the Holy Spirit will work as long as we do not hinder His work. We do not need to encourage or stir up the Holy Spirit. The heart and spirit of every responsible one must be open. They must push their spirit out in the meetings. Some people never open their mouths. This means that there is something wrong with them. There are times in the meetings when the saints cannot lift up the spirit. We have to charge forward at such times. Sometimes the brothers and sisters go off on tangents, and we have to bring the meeting back on course with hymns, prayers, or speakings. On the one hand, the responsible brothers cannot be too artificial. On the other hand, they cannot be too loose. We must learn to touch the Spirit ourselves first and learn to conduct the meeting according to the leading of the Spirit. The elders and district leaders must come together often to study together. They should make adjustments for the meetings and correct the meetings as needed. They have to discuss the way the brothers and sisters selected the hymns, prayed, and spoke in the previous meeting. They may observe that if a brother had stopped his prayer at a certain point, it would have been most excellent. There was no need for the brother to go on. The same thing can be said about speaking. They have to adjust and correct the saints one by one. Some people should stop at a certain point; everything they say after that point is redundant. A person should stop his prayer at the point where the "amen" is the loudest. But some people pray until all the amens are drained away, and even then they do not stop. If everyone learns this way, we will be more accurate in touching the Spirit in a meeting.</p><p>The Holy Spirit in the church works beyond what we can ask or think. Therefore, we should not expect to receive merely what we hope to receive; we should expect something higher, not something lower. In the meetings a brother may stand up to correct something. His correction may not be accurate, but he may consider himself to be perfectly right. If, in the course of their fellowship, all the brothers feel that something was wrong with this one's correction, he should put a question mark on what he thinks is right. Such fellowship will deliver us out of subjectivity and enable us to touch the thought of the Holy Spirit more.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Flesh, yet at the Same Time<br />Encouraging Everyone to Function</h2><p>If a brother or sister is in the habit of speaking contrary things, the elders alone may not be that effective in dealing with him or her. There is the need of a few more brothers and sisters to speak the truth in love to this brother or sister. It is wrong to have love without the liberty to speak the truth. Sometimes a man speaks the truth, but he does not have love. This is also wrong. If you want to correct anyone, you must learn first to pray and then correct him in a spirit of meekness (Gal. 6:1). At the same time, you cannot do this in a sectarian way. You cannot base your decision on the idea of a few people. You cannot say that anyone who opposes your will is automatically wrong. You have to be clear about the will of the Spirit and touch the flow of the Spirit. A brother may decide not to pray after he is rebuked. You have to exhort him and encourage him to pray again. On the one hand, we have to believe in the leading of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, it will be easy for the flesh to be set loose if we give the brothers and sisters too much liberty. Hence, we must exercise authority to deal with the flesh. If we do not exercise authority, the meetings will be in confusion. At the same time, we must not allow the brothers and sisters to quench their spirit; they must function.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING VISITATION</h2><p>Witness Lee: Visitation is the most important work in the church. We ask all the responsible ones in the districts to make arrangements for the brothers and sisters to make visitations.</p><p>There are two kinds of visitations. The first is the visitation of new believers. As soon as a man believes in the Lord, the responsible brothers have to arrange for brothers and sisters to visit him, to strengthen his faith, and to make him feel that the church cares for him. The second is special visitation. This includes visiting saints who have lost their jobs, who are sick, or who have problems with their studies or their living. It also includes visitation under special occasions like death in the family, celebrations, or marriages. If we can cover these two kinds of visitations in a proper way, the church will be strong and will grow.</p><p>Visitation requires all the brothers and sisters to work together in coordination. In a district there may be twenty brothers and sisters on the list who are somewhat indifferent, cold, or passive toward the Lord. The responsible ones have to find the zealous, compassionate, burning, and positive ones among the fifty saints meeting in that district and coordinate them together to make the visitations. If possible, visitation should also cover all the other brothers and sisters in the form of regular fellowship. The more fellowship there is among the brothers and sisters, the better it is, and the more blessing we will see. The Lord promised His followers that they will receive a hundredfold of everything, including parents, children, brothers, and sisters (Matt. 19:29).</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2><p>The saints should not return home right after the meetings. They should stay behind and fellowship with the other brothers and sisters, or spend twenty to thirty minutes visiting other saints. The time for the bread-breaking meeting should not be too long; it should be at most one hour. As soon as we bring the saints' spirit to a high peak, we should briskly move on to the worship of the Father. After the bread-breaking meeting, we can leave half an hour for fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING EATING TOGETHER</h2><p>We should encourage the brothers and sisters to come together to eat more often. They should open their homes and invite three to five brothers and sisters over for meals and fellowship. But they should not prepare anything special. If they prepare too much or too elaborately, the elders have to step in and intervene. Many brothers and sisters encounter problems and weaknesses in their daily life. Sometimes a little spiritual fellowship will bring the saints through these trials. This is like the circulation of blood in the human body. Where the circulation goes, germs and waste materials are eliminated. Sometimes it is not necessary to mention the problems at all; they go away spontaneously through such spiritual fellowship. Dr. Stearns in Chefoo once said that it is an easy thing to invite people over for a meal. All one has to do is to add a pair of chopsticks. There is no reason we cannot do it more often. We have to encourage the brothers and sisters to open up their homes to others. If many people practice this, we will accomplish ninety percent of what we set out to accomplish with the visitation work. Single brothers and sisters can also use the married ones' homes to invite others for a meal and fellowship. In such fellowship, there is no need to touch problems or weaknesses. All we need to do is to exercise loving concern and provide spiritual nourishment one to another. Spontaneously, the guests will be stirred up, and something will happen within them.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO ASK OTHERS FOR THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DOING THINGS, AND TRUSTING IN<br />THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT FOR THE DETAILS</h2><p>The above few matters is a general fellowship of principles related to our service. The brothers and sisters should not act presumptuously; they should ask the elders. After the elders have laid down the principles, they should act accordingly by the leading of the Holy Spirit when they set out to execute the fine details. If the brothers and sisters do not learn to ask, they will be in confusion. But if everyone asks, there will be no confusion even if a thousand or two thousand people are serving together at the same time. The brothers and sisters must keep learning. In doing everything they must learn to ask the elderly brothers and sisters, but they should only consult them as far as the general principles are concerned. As for the small details, they have to learn to touch the leading of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes young people can ask too much. They give the older ones a headache. Some people even ask if it will rain tomorrow, and if they should bring an umbrella with them. The young people have to learn to touch the feeling of the Holy Spirit. They should also learn to adjust themselves according to outward needs while moving according to the principles set forth by the elders' fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR</h2><p>We have said that the brothers and sisters should beware that they do not build up any friendship outside the love of the Lord. In doing something, we may come across some knowledge of the brothers and sisters. Other than trying to understand what we need to know, we must avoid trying to know too much about the brothers and sisters. Even if you do know something, you should not tell others about it lightly. Man has a lust to know and to probe into other people's business. For example, we may see two brothers talking to each other, and within us there is an urge to eavesdrop. This lust must be dealt with strictly. We have to remember that the Lord Jesus' Spirit knows everything that goes on in man's heart (Mark 2:8). Yet the book of Isaiah tells us that he is a blind and deaf servant (42:19). Our Lord seemed to be ignorant about many things. For example, Judas was a thief, yet the Lord asked him to take charge of the purse. We have to learn from our Lord's example. We should only pick up knowledge of other people's business under the Lord's sovereignty. If a man has a craving to know others' business, he is a very fallen man indeed.</p><p>Moreover, the responsible ones should not lightly talk about the spiritual strengths or weaknesses of others. We have to learn to speak under the leading of the Holy Spirit. Our speaking has to be discreet, and we have to be in fear and trembling when we speak. Unless God measures the knowledge of the saints' problems to us, we should not probe into them. We should not scheme to know the brothers' and sisters' problems. Even if they reveal their secrets to us, we should keep this information secret. We must all learn to speak under the restriction of the Holy Spirit. These rules should be adhered to closely.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ADVANTAGES OF FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Watchman Nee:The most intimate kind of fellowship is the fellowship in the homes. Hence, there is much profit to the saints opening up their homes for fellowship. The responsible ones in a district should set a good example for the other brothers and sisters to follow. When Timothy and Silas reached Paul, he was constrained by the word (Acts 18:5). Later, Paul went to Troas for the gospel. When he did not find Titus, he had no rest in his spirit, and taking leave of them he went forth into Macedonia (2 Cor. 2:12-13). Paul had intimate fellowship with Titus. When Paul did not see him, he had no rest in his spirit. Christians do not necessarily have to communicate their problems with each other through words. Many times because of intimate fellowship, they are able to touch each others' condition in their spirits. Some brothers and sisters are reluctant to obey the Lord and forsake the world. But through fellowship their problems are solved. It is not our ability that solves the problems but the flow of God's life through fellowship that spontaneously washes others' feet, renews and invigorates them, and solves their problems.</p><h2 class="head1">DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>The meals among the brothers and sisters cannot be an ordinary meal together. They must be a kind of agape as described in Jude 12. That word can be translated as "love feast." In the original language, there is only the word love, not feast. It is in the eating that the love is expressed. In the early churches, the believers often took meals together for the sake of fellowshipping and worshipping together in love (Acts 2:46). Such feasts were often linked to the Lord's supper (1 Cor. 11:20-21, 33); they were called the agape. Hence, when we come together to eat, we express our mutual love one for the other. We break bread together for mutual fellowship; this is our communion. This is the meaning of our breaking of bread. The Lord never charged individuals to break bread by themselves. He gave this commandment where at least three or five people are gathered together (cf. Luke 22:19-20). The breaking of bread is for remembering the Lord on the one hand and for fellowship among the believers on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head1">SUPPLYING OTHERS WITH LIFE</h2><p>It is not too hard for the leading brothers to lead the saints with the truth. Since the feeling within each person's spirit varies, you have to learn to touch the feeling within man's spirit. The brothers and sisters may be depressed or elated in their spiritual feelings. The degree of depression and elation may be different. In fellowshipping with them, you have to have some spiritual discernment. With discernment you will render them some practical spiritual supply in life. Man's real need is the supply of life, not zealous words. A man cannot be zealous all the time. The responsible ones have to be sensitive in their spirit. They have to feel what the brothers and sisters feel.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW REMINDERS</h2><p>In dealing with the brothers and sisters, you have to act in the principle of "two or three." If the feeling of the whole church is to deal with a certain brother, it will be easy to touch such a person's conscience.</p><p>The responsible brothers must learn to be bold on the one hand and to be in fear on the other hand. They must not be loose with themselves. When the Holy Spirit is in control and He wants you to be bold, you can be bold. When the Holy Spirit is in control, no one will dare be loose even if you allow him to be loose. Some brothers make mistakes all the time, but when they come to the meeting, they do not make any mistakes. The difference lies in the control of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit is in control, even wrong things can be turned right. Those with little faith often hold the meetings tightly in their hands and do not let go. But you have to learn to allow the Holy Spirit to have the full authority. Do not keep everything in your own hand.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SANITATION</h2><p>Concerning the cup that is passed around during the table meeting, some have asked if we should disinfect it a little before passing it on to the next person. Even if the air is disinfected, it will contain many germs after an hour. From the hygienic point of view, this matter is a hard call. We have three doctors here; they are the director of the Health Department, the director of the Army Medical Department, and the principal of a medical school. I believe they can give us a clear understanding of the subject. For example, Dr. Mei said that he is not afraid of drinking from the same cup because he believes that God is sovereign to keep germs away from us. Even if we touch the germs, we will not be infected. In His divine arrangement, God has not ordained that man isolate himself from germs. We have germs around us everywhere, and those who are healthy are not harmed by them. We should fear not, but only believe (Mark 5:36). But we should allow those who are weak in faith to do what they want to do. We should not condemn or stop them.</p><p>If a person is sick, we can ask him to sit in the last row. This is for the sake of practicing brotherly love. We have to take care of those who are weak in faith. This is not a legal requirement. If any outsider who smokes comes, we can ask him to sit in the last row in order that the weak brothers and sisters will not be affected. This is like a family with a son who has tuberculosis. When he speaks, others have to cover their mouths. Of course, the parents love the children and want to be close to them, but neither do they want the whole family to get tuberculosis. Our brothers and sisters have to learn from the Lord Jesus, who in His compassion touched the leper with His hand (Mark 1:40-42). We have to believe in the power of the Lord's protection. We should not be afraid of infection. If we do not have faith, we can be infected anytime, not just through drinking from the cup. Men living near the North Pole can die from the cold, but no one dies of a cold. Cold viruses are everywhere, but not everyone who comes in contact with them catches a cold. We have to believe and trust in the Lord's protection.</p><h2 class="head1">A QUESTION OF CHURCH SERVICE</h2><p>Witness Lee:The responsible brothers have to pay attention to the standard of the church service. If they set the standard too high, they may create a problem. Some problems arising in the service must be dealt with according to general spiritual principles. When a problem arises, it cannot be dealt with as an isolated case. There are, of course, exceptions when things that do not edify the saints occur in the church. But if such things happen again and again, something must be wrong within the church or with the leading brothers. If something happens only occasionally, there is no need to pay too much attention to it. But if it happens again and again, something is wrong. Therefore, this is not a matter of dealing with isolated cases. It is not a matter of dealing with things case by case. The elders have to make confessions before the Lord. They have to be dealt with, to receive enlightenment, and to follow the spiritual principles. When the immune system of the church is strong, it will not worry about germs.</p><p>Hong Kong is a civilized country. If the service in the church is strong, many problems associated with modern civilization can be overcome. The responsible brothers should turn the saints' attention to the big things. Do not pay too much attention to the small and secondary things. If we can show the saints something more important than hygiene in the church, their attention will be turned. Once a man is enlightened by the heavenly light, he will not be bound by earthly worries.</p><p>In Shanghai we have a lady who grew up in a very protected environment. She is like a bulb in a little pot; no one can touch her. Such kind of people get sick very easily. Those who are used to a rough and rugged life, however, can overcome many sicknesses. Sickness is a tool of Satan; he applies it especially to those who are weak. We are not talking about hygiene. If the church is heavenly and strong, it will transcend earthly hygiene and human weaknesses.</p><p>Brother Chien's concern is mostly a psychological fear. His inward spiritual capacity is not big enough. This is the reason he is worried about physical hygiene. Those who are spiritually strong judge things according to the science of spirituality. Those who are spiritually strong can sleep with the dead, put their mouth upon his mouth, their eyes upon his eyes, and their hands upon his hands (2 Kings 4:32-35). But those who are spiritually weak can only weep before the dead (Mark 5:38). We have to learn to be strong in our spirit and learn to transcend all physical and fleshly limitations.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE GENUINE SERVICE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Evening, February 25, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Eph. 4:11-12, 16</h1><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING A FRESH CONSECRATION</h2><p>Watchman Nee:These are sobering days. Some of you have handed yourselves over to the Lord and are willing to rise up to serve Him. You might have struggled a little at the beginning. During your struggle you might have experienced pain and sadness, but once you offered yourself, you were filled with joy. I can sense your feeling. Many people have filled out a consecration slip and indicated a willingness to offer all, including future, career, time, and body to the Lord. But today I want to ask a question: Is your feeling different today from when you handed yourself over to the Lord ten or twenty days ago? It seems as if your feeling tonight is not as strong as it was a few days ago. Whenever we slip back in our consecration, we slip back in our Christian life. Every day we have to ask ourselves, "Am I still fresh? Am I still shining inwardly?" The Christian life is like polishing shoes; they must be polished again and again to maintain a shine. If we feel that we are no longer shining inwardly, we have to ask the Lord if something is wrong with us. We have to find out why we have lost the heavenly taste. We must learn to maintain a fresh consecration all the time.</p><p>In the Old Testament, the fire in the outer court was lighted only once. After that it needed wood and sacrifice daily to keep the fire burning day and night (Lev. 6:12). The fire could only be lighted once. One does not wait until the fire goes out to light it again. The fire on the altar is an unceasing fire. In order to keep it burning, there must be sacrifices every day. In the New Testament we offer ourselves as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). In order to keep the fire burning, we need to offer ourselves up continually as a sacrifice. A living sacrifice means that we offer ourselves to God as a sacrifice while we are living. If there is sin, reservation, or staleness in us, or if we forego our consecration, the divine fire on the altar will stop. If we do not do anything that hurts ourselves, if we will not inflict pain on our feelings, love, will, ambition, human aspirations, desires, and hopes, we have stopped offering ourselves as a living sacrifice. If we have never hurt ourselves once, we can claim that we are filled with joy, but this joy will be unreliable. Once we offer up everything as an offering, we have sacrificed ourselves. We will suffer loss, pain, and wounds, but God will gain something. Therefore, if you feel that your joy in the last few days has waned, you can try giving away some of your cherished items again. When you give them away with one hand, you may be filled with pain and hurt, but you will receive joy with the other hand. It seems as if you are acting against yourself, but this is the only way to ensure that your joy remains.</p><p>Please forgive me for saying this: The joy in some people's face changes all the time, but when others make a decision, they never change back. If our consecration does not change, our joy will not change. Those whose joy has changed have changed their consecration. If we want to maintain and even deepen our joy, we need a constant consecration. A Christian's face is a window. From this window we see his consecration. It is one thing to fill out a consecration slip. It is another thing to draw a sword to kill. We admit that we are too slow in reviewing and processing your consecration. The brothers and sisters who are responsible for this work are not experienced enough. But what we have offered to the Lord belongs to Him forever. We cannot regret and try to take it back. We must never eat what we have vomited. Otherwise, we will lose the blessing of the Lord which we are entitled to receive from Him.</p><h2 class="head1">ONENESS AND COORDINATION<br />BEING THE ISSUE OF THE LIFE WITHIN</h2><p>Witness Lee: A few days ago we fellowshipped about answering the demand of Christ within us. This is the genuine service of the church. Our service in coordination is not something artificial. Many people talk about the teaching of oneness. When I hear it, my spirit feels uncomfortable. Many people are not clear about oneness. The principle of oneness is actually the same as the principle of coordination. First, we have to understand that the oneness of the church is not something manmade. If I am not one with a few brothers, I cannot be exhorted to be one with doctrines. If oneness can be achieved by exhortation, this oneness is false and artificial. We may pass on some doctrines to the brothers, telling them that we are all for the Lord, for the saints, and for the church, and as such we should drop our opinions. The brothers may say, "Okay, this word has convinced us. We give up. We are willing to be one." This is still human oneness; it is not the oneness that issues from life. But if we sense a spontaneous demand within us, and we willingly allow the life within us to flow out, we will have the genuine oneness. The genuine oneness of the church is the coming forth of Christ within each one of us. When this outflow of Christ is added together, we have the oneness. If none of us answers the demand of the Holy Spirit within us, we do not have the oneness. Only as Christ comes forth from all the saints is there the genuine oneness.</p><p>The coordination in the church is not a kind of piling together but the result of us handing ourselves over willingly to the Lord and serving and working together under the sovereign arrangement of the Holy Spirit. If we call three or five brothers and sisters together and assign them some service, this is merely a kind of organization; it is not genuine coordination. Coordination is having the grace to bring out the Christ in Brother Chang and the Christ in Brother Lee and then serving together. If we harbor a sin, if we have some worldly cravings or carnal objects that we have not given up, or if we still jealously guard our self, ideas, inclinations, and concepts from His dealing even though they were touched by the Spirit, we may say that we are one with the brothers and sisters, but in reality we cannot be joined to another lover of the Lord. This is because this lover of the Lord has forsaken the world, rejected sin, and dealt with the self, but we have not. We must realize that outward oneness is manmade and false.</p><p>Let me repeat: The coordination of the Body is not organizational; it is something that issues from the life within. For the past few days I have had a heavy burden within me, hoping that Brother Nee would say a word concerning coordination. However, Brother Nee has asked me to speak. I can only obey. I feel that there is one thing which I have not yet been able to release. This cannot be covered in one or two words.</p><p>What the Lord has done through Brother Nee in Hong Kong is a great thing, an unprecedented thing. This is something that the Lord has done; it is not something that man's exhortation can achieve. Some have handed over their possessions. Others have forsaken the world and handed over their future, their career, their body, and their time. For this I truly worship the Lord. I am afraid, however, that some will think that this handing over is a procedure to get into the coordination. Actually, by handing ourselves over, we open a way for Christ to flow out of us. Coordination is when the spirit within all of us is released. Coordination is an event in our spirit; it liberates the life that lies within our spirit. I would ask the saints in Hong Kong, as well as the responsible brothers, to give me the liberty to say a word. I feel that you have paid too much attention to the practical affairs and have neglected the spirit. I dare not say that you have ignored it, but at least you have neglected it. All of you have handed yourselves over. But your spirits have not been handed over yet. Hence, you are still not in the coordination. The church is the Christ within every Christian being added together. Church service is the Christ within everyone being released. When the life of Christ comes forth from the brothers and sisters, we have coordination.</p><p>When we were in Foochow, twenty to thirty workers handed over not only their material possessions, but their work as well. Once they handed themselves over in this way, they were able to coordinate together. As long as we hold on to anything, whatever it may be, we cannot coordinate, and there is no oneness or one accord. Oneness, one accord, and coordination are nothing but the coming forth of the Christ within us. If the life of Christ in the believers in Hong Kong cannot come forth, nothing will happen even if the gospel teams parade through the street with bullhorns and even if we make all kinds of arrangements for visitation and service. I hope that the saints here in Hong Kong can be taught by God in this particular point.</p><p>The church in Taipei registered itself as "Christian Assembly Hall" with the government because of political expediency. Later some people came from Shanghai and used the same name. They even imitated our gospel teams, and they practiced head covering as well. They can be exactly the same as we are in everything, but the release of the Holy Spirit is not something that one can contend for. Our service to the Lord depends on whether or not the Spirit has a free way through us. All outward imitation and mimicking are artificial; they are not the genuine service of the church. The church's service in coordination depends entirely on the release of the Holy Spirit from within us; it has nothing to do with how closely we can imitate one another. The problems of the churches and the co-workers cannot be solved any other way. They can only be solved in the Body, in the Holy Spirit, and in life. When Christ within us is released, life flows and problems go away.</p><p>If all the brothers and sisters can be one and if they remain in harmony and in coordination, there will be power in the church service. If a man works much, yet does not sense the Holy Spirit's operation within him, this is like eating food that contains no vitamins at all. We may hold tightly on to anything in our hands or in our hearts. It may not be money. It may be the work, our view, or our feeling. As long as there is something that we will not let go of, some area where we refuse to be dealt with in, it is impossible to have power or to coordinate with others. Coordination is not outward activity. This standard is too low. Coordination is absolutely not for taking care of outward works. It is for spiritual building up. It is something that issues from the life within. In order to serve in coordination, the life within us has to come out.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF COORDINATION</h2><p>How can we be coordinated? Ephesians 4:15b says that we have to be joined to the Head Christ in all things. This includes our fellowship with Him. We have to ask ourselves all the time: Do we have a constant sweet fellowship with Christ? We should not only ask if our conscience is at peace, but ask whether or not we have fellowship with Christ. Peace in the conscience only fulfills a negative requirement. On the positive side, we have to have fellowship with the Head. Many times we have not committed any sin and there is no condemnation in our conscience. Yet inwardly we are depressed; there is no way for us to have fellowship with Christ. Perhaps there are some hindrances between us and Him. In order to have fellowship with Christ, we need to have clearances and dealings. When every member is joined to the Head Christ, the whole Body will be fitly framed together in Him. This means after we have fellowship with Christ, we must still ask ourselves whether or not we are fitly framed together with the brothers and sisters. On the one hand, coordination depends on our fellowship with Christ the Head and, on the other hand, with our relationship to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Today there are many saved Christians, but there are not too many who have fellowship with Christ. There are less who are joined to the brothers and sisters in their fellowship with Christ. A man may not err that much in his outward conduct, but fellowship with the Lord is a very sensitive and tender thing. As long as there is a little isolation, fellowship will stop. A worker can lose his fellowship with God just because he has held on to his work. This is a terrible thing. It is possible for us to lose God's fellowship yet still be successful in our outward work. It is possible for us to have God's blessing yet be void of the fellowship of life. If we have fallen into this condition, our outward contact with the brothers and sisters will be nothing but human endeavor. If the life within us is released and we have fellowship with the brothers and sisters, spontaneously there will be the coordination. Coordination is a matter of fellowshipping with the Head and being properly joined to the brothers and sisters. Our spiritual sense within, our fellowship with the Lord, and our relationship with the other members have to be strengthened and sustained.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STANDARD OF SERVICE<br />BEING ONE'S SPIRITUAL CAPACITY</h2><p>The extent to which we can say that a service in the church is right or wrong and the seriousness to which such mistakes should be viewed is judged purely by the amount of spiritual capacity we possess. For example, when the floor is dirty, we must not only deal with the person who is cleaning the floor but also with the spiritual principle. Usually when we encounter such a situation there are two ways to deal with it. The first is to deal with the ones who are responsible for the cleaning. Is this the right way to deal with it? All the brothers are clear that this is not enough. The second way is to deal with the spiritual principle. In the church it is more important to deal with things according to spiritual principles. The goal is that the one responsible for the floor would touch the Lord. It is useless to rebuke him so that he mops and cleans the floor but does not have any spiritual fellowship with the Lord or find any spiritual supply.</p><p>As the brothers and sisters are cleaning the floor, they should pray that the Lord would sanctify the spots where they are cleaning. They should pray that those who stand on it would fear the Lord, that an unbeliever would believe in the Lord, and that he would realize that he is standing on sanctified ground. If the brothers and sisters do this, an outward thing will be made to carry spiritual weight. Church service is not merely outward activities; it is for Christ to flow out of us through the Holy Spirit. This matter alone shows us the high standard Christ puts upon church service.</p><p>Suppose we have fellowship with the Head in the morning. By two o'clock in the afternoon, Christ may have a new demand within us. If we argue with Him and do not yield to this new demand, we will lose our intimate fellowship with the Head. When we come at four o'clock in the afternoon to clean the floor, we will not have any fellowship with the Lord, and our cleaning will be like the cleaning of any ordinary person. If a church only pays attention to outward activities, and is slow, dull, and dim in spiritual feelings, it will not carry much spiritual weight. Our service must be a service in the Holy Spirit. Although we can have many activities outwardly, the life of Christ within us must come forth. If we can do this, the church will be established in a real and genuine way, and we will see the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM HUMAN ARTIFICIAL SERVICE</h2><p>Watchman Nee: During the past few days Brother Lee has been urging me to speak, but I do not know what kind of thoughts are within him. Today I feel to say something. Please forgive me for saying a frank word to you. For the past ten days at least, I have been in a quandary. This is not a matter of whether or not the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over. I feel that a basic problem is still unresolved in all those who have handed themselves over. We can even pinpoint the problem: Too much of our service is human and artificial; it does not have its source in the life within us.</p><p>I have been speaking for the Lord for about thirty years. I know that no sinner can be saved without confessing his sins. Similarly, I can say that no Christian can know the reality of the church without making confession for his artificial and human service in the church. There were three brothers (a co-worker, a brother, and a leading one) who were dissatisfied with the church in Hong Kong. They often criticized many things in front of me. I am not saying that the critical ones are right. But if we do not let go of one or two things and if we would not deal with them, our service and coordination are equally wrong. Unless we deal with these basic issues, our coordination and service will be nothing but an outward show.</p><p>Suppose I make a model of a bee out of wax. It may look exactly like a real bee, but even a child can tell that it is not a real bee. A real bee has life. In the coming days, what we need is not to make a bigger wax bee but to have some real bees. We should not think that we can justify ourselves once we have handed ourselves over. It is true that our sins are to be condemned, but our righteousness is equally ragged before God. George Whitefield said once that even our tears of repentance need the washing of the blood. It is not just our evils that must be condemned and dealt with. What little bit of good that we possess must be destroyed also. We should not think that we have the real thing as long as we have the proper, outward appearance.</p><p>I beg you to believe that we know what is artificial service and what is genuine service of the Holy Spirit. I had no thought of saying such a word, but during the past few months, I have felt that many of the services in the church are artificial and manmade; they are void of any spiritual touch. Many people are paying too much attention to activities. They do not have a basic understanding of service, yet they come to serve. It seems as if all of us have become wax bee makers. I am not saying that we have a problem with our behavior. This is a matter of nature. The issue is whether something is human or spiritual.</p><p>I have been waiting for one kind of prayer, but I have not heard it during these days. We must all admit that many of the past messages were wax-like, and the services were wax-like. Many of the services and the coordination were false. In the world we can be false about anything because the flesh has a place in the world. But in the church there should not be any falsehood. We can be false in a very honest way. During the past few days, I have felt extremely terrible about many things. I read your consecration slips over ten times. On top of the pile are those from the co-workers and the responsible ones. Following these are the slips from all the brothers and sisters. Every time I look at them, I ask myself whether or not they handed themselves over because of the urging of the Spirit or because they were going along with some outward activities. No dealing in the course of the remission of sin is glorious. Similarly, no service of the flesh is to be boasted of. Let me repeat: This is not a matter of changing any methods but a matter of the very nature of things. I ask that the brothers and sisters not care so much for their "face"; they should go to the Lord for shining and dealing. On the one hand, I am very happy that the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over. On the other hand, I feel sad that they are not able to differentiate real things from false things. I hope that in these days you will learn to have the genuine service, that is, service that issues from the Holy Spirit within.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Lord, we admit that we are not qualified to take the lead among the brothers and sisters. We cannot meet their needs, much less Your demands. In the past we had many thoughts and concepts which we deemed right and good. We ask that You forgive us. We admit that our consecration is behind that of many brothers and sisters, and the dealings that we have received are much less than what they have learned. We need Your special mercy. Lord, we are no better than the other brothers and sisters. We admit that we have made the ground useless (Luke 13:7). It is a small thing that we have offended You personally, but, Lord, we have offended the church, the Body of Christ. This is too serious. We have been appointed as the responsible ones. The burden is too heavy. We truly need Your sufficient grace and Your empowering.</p><p>Lord, we do not know where our confession should begin. We ask Your light to shine on what we have confessed and on what we are too slow to understand and confess. Forgive us for all these things. We ask that You accept anything in our service that is from You. We are willing to tear down all wood, grass, and stubble in our services. We want to have services that are gold, silver, and precious stones. We admit that there was no release of the spirit and of life in our services in the past. We admit that we did many things, but we forgot that we were serving You. We have done much, but we have not learned the lessons of service. Gracious Lord, be merciful to us!</p><p>Lord, we believe that since You have begun this good work, You will finish it. Today You have spoken through Your two servants. This is Your grace and great mercy to the church in Hong Kong. It is also Your mercy and grace that You have given us a spirit of repentance tonight. Your servants have not held back one thing that they should speak. It is Your great grace that they have not withheld their speaking from us. If Your servants were to become silent, we would be like dead persons. Since You have spoken, fulfill Your word. May our prayer tonight count towards Your plan of the ages. Grant us a fresh turn, a new beginning in the church in Hong Kong tonight.</p><p>May You work on us anew. We all give ourselves to You in a fresh way as a living sacrifice. Lord, although we are the overseers, we need Your mercy more than the other brothers and sisters. Your servants have spoken strong words, and this is a sign of Your love to Your church. Lord, even our repentance needs the cleansing of Your blood. We need more revelation and shining to expose our corruption and natural constitution. May our service and coordination in the church issue from the spirit, and may they bear the element of life. May You be fully satisfied. Amen!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(6)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:February 27, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE BODY AND ONE SPIRIT</h2><p>First Corinthians 12&mdash;14 is mainly on spiritual inspiration. Although chapter thirteen deals specifically with love, it speaks of the relationship between love and gifts; it is not just an expos&#233; on the doctrine of love. This is proven by the last verse of chapter twelve. I show to you a most excellent way refers to the love spoken of in chapter thirteen.</p><p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit." The previous verse says that men from different backgrounds are baptized into the same Holy Spirit and are all given to drink one Spirit. Although each one of us has received Christ, we can act independently. For example, the church in Philippi was in one accord for the furtherance of the gospel on the one hand, and yet found itself not being of one mind and not thinking the same thing on the other hand (Phil. 1:5; 2:2; 4:2). Hence, we must not only receive Christ, but also we must be baptized in one Spirit into one Body and must drink one Spirit. We can find an analogy in ice cubes. A block of ice can be broken down into small ice cubes, and each one of us can hold a piece. But when we put these cubes into water and melt them together, they will become one piece of ice again after freezing.</p><p>Ephesians 4 speaks of seven factors of oneness of the Holy Spirit. Two of these seven factors are one Body and one Spirit (vv. 3-6). First Corinthians 12:13 explains this one Body and one Spirit. The one Body comes from baptism, and the one Spirit comes from the common drinking of the saints. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit." In this verse we find three main points. First, we are all baptized into this Spirit, who is a person. Second, we are all baptized into one Body. Third, we are made to drink of this one Spirit to whom we belong. The last two points&mdash;the baptism into one Body and the drinking of one Spirit&mdash;come from the Holy Spirit in the first point.</p><p>We have to see that the second and third points are in apposition to the first point. Just as the one Body comes from the one Spirit, our drinking also comes from the one Spirit. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the driving force. The result is the one Body and the drinking of the one Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 specifically explains how the one Body and one Spirit come about.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h2><h2 class="head2">Visitation</h2><p>In addition to the need for zeal and earnestness, there are two crucial qualifications for those who are engaged in visitation work. The first is love, and the second is wisdom. If a man has zeal and nothing else, he will only generate commotion. Only those who have love can care for others, and only they can comfort the brokenhearted and strengthen the weak. Those who have problems generally have a story in their heart to tell. If we have love, others will pour out their hearts to us. A person engaged in visitation must not only have love but also must have the wisdom to say the right thing and respond the right way.</p><h2 class="head2">A Principle Governing Church Service</h2><p>One principle governing church service is that the work and the service must be assigned; they must be placed in the hands of the brothers and sisters. The affairs of the church cannot be in the hand of just a few people. The more people are involved in the church, the stronger the church service will be.</p><h2 class="head2">Selecting the Right Person to Do the Job</h2><p>In selecting the right person to do the job, the first qualification we should consider is a person's willingness to do the job. The next thing we should do is to teach this person how to work and to work together with him. The qualification for working in the church is not ability, but willingness. It is all right if a person does not have the skill to do a job. As long as he is willing, he can be trained. The most important thing in church service is to select those who are willing to work. The next thing to consider is whether or not they are good at what they do.</p><h2 class="head2">Making Arrangements for the Services</h2><p>In order for the whole Body to rise up to serve, all the brothers and sisters have to be busy with something. Hence, we have to make arrangements for the majority of the saints to get into some areas of service. First, all the brothers and sisters have to be assigned to some service. Second, the responsible brothers have to carefully look into all the arrangements with the responsible ones of each area of service. Third, there is the gospel parade team and the gospel visitation. This is a service in which all the brothers and sisters can participate.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:February 27, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS</h2><p>Both Brother Lee and I have felt that many brothers and sisters are lacking in spiritual consciousness. In order for God to have a way through the church, His children must recognize the authority of the Holy Spirit. Whether or not a man knows the authority of the Holy Spirit depends on his spiritual consciousness. If he is lacking in spiritual consciousness, he will not know anything about the authority of the Holy Spirit. Even if he speaks and acts in the most sincere way, he cannot be truly spiritual. Something may appear spiritual outwardly but not be so in reality. We must learn to discern this matter clearly. We can see men as trees, and we can see a piano as an organ. However, no tree can walk, and no organ will play like a piano.</p><p>If we are lacking in spiritual consciousness, we will never be submissive in our heart. Many people believe too much in their own eyes. They do not see, but they think that they have seen clearly. They cherish their own subjectivity. It is hard to say the same thing twice to such a person. If none of the responsible brothers and sisters have any spiritual discernment and if they merely coordinate by assigning works to the different groups, they may think that they have a spiritual consciousness and that they are sincere in their coordination, but in reality they are in big trouble. Today both Brother Witness and I have the same feeling that there is a lack of spiritual consciousness among the brothers and sisters. I hope that all the brothers and sisters will learn to touch their spirit's feeling. They should learn to know what spiritual consciousness is. We can explain red to a blind man all we want, but he will still not understand it. Even if the entire population of Russia explains red to a blind man, he still would not know it because he has never seen it. There are certain laws in the spiritual pathways. The operation of the Holy Spirit can only be realized by those with spiritual consciousness. This is like saying that the Bible is God's breathing. But the entire Bible can also become letter and form. Once spiritual consciousness is absent, the Bible becomes letter and form.</p><h2 class="head1">DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SPIRIT AND THE LETTER</h2><p>What is spirit, and what is the letter? What is the difference between the feeling of the spirit and the knowledge derived from the mind or from one's judgment? In the Bible the letter is not a good thing. The letter that Paul refers to in 2 Corinthians is the Old Testament Scripture. Although the Old Testament is part of the Bible, it is nothing but letter if one does not touch it in spirit. Something as good as the Bible can become letter. For something to be letter means that it was worked on by the Holy Spirit once, but the Spirit is no longer present when applied again. This makes it letter. For example, yesterday Brother Lee read two verses from the book of Romans. You might have felt the voice of the Holy Spirit in that reading. But when you explain the same verse to another person, it is not under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and it becomes nothing but letter.</p><p>A man can be in the book of Romans every day of the year. He can understand all the objective truths, but he cannot tell you when the Holy Spirit speaks or moves in him. To him, the book of Romans is the letter. He may wake up early every morning to read the Bible. He may set aside time every day to pray. But if these are merely rituals, he possesses nothing but the letter. Although outwardly the spiritual shell is still present, inwardly nothing of the spirit is present. This is the letter. We must have a consciousness of the spirit within before we can release something of the spirit. Only then will our words not be the letter. Suppose Brother Lee read Romans 2:18-19 on the Lord's Day afternoon. There might have been the spirit within Brother Lee, but there was not the consciousness of the spirit within me. I listened with my mind. As a result, I only received the letter. If I want to touch the spirit, I must have the spirit myself. Brother Lee had the spirit and the word. When I listened, I had to have the spirit and the word as well. Only spiritual organs can realize spiritual things. The objective letter that Brother Lee read, when mingled with the spirit, became God's word. Subjectively, I have to understand his word with my mind, but I must also touch the spirit behind Brother Lee's word with my spirit. If I do not touch the spirit behind the word, his word will only be letter to me. Hence, this has nothing to do with whether or not a man's mind understands. It is a matter of whether or not we are touching the Spirit with our spirit. We may expound God's word clearly, and others may understand it perfectly. But if we do not touch the spirit of God's word with our spirit, we have merely the letter. If a doctor operates on a patient in the way of letter, the sick man may turn into a corpse. This is more true in the spiritual realm.</p><p>When Brother Lee gives a message, the first thing I notice is not how well he expounds the Bible or how appropriate his illustrations are. In listening to him, I first touch his spirit with my spirit. The main question is whether or not the spirit is released. Whether a message can supply others depends on the release of the spirit of the speaker. It has to do with whether or not the message touches others' spirit. This has nothing to do with whether or not the message is well delivered and whether the explanations are clear. Often I hear young people boasting: "If Brother Lee can say ten things about this topic, I can say twenty things about it." You may have a loud voice, balanced logic, and a clear mind. But if you do not have the spirit, what you have amounts to nothing but the letter. Hebrews 5:12-14 says that in order to discriminate between the divine words of righteousness and the elementary words of the beginning, one's faculties have to be exercised. He also has to be experienced in the practice. In order for a person to run fast, he must not only be able to walk well but must practice the skill of running all the time. In order to develop spiritual consciousness, one must not only use his spirit but must touch the feeling of his spirit all the time. Only then will he be experienced in his practice.</p><p>Everything of the church must be conducted in the spirit. It is not a matter of getting things done and establishing right procedures. Even if the church in Hong Kong copies Taipei's mode of service, it will only be letter if the spirit is ignored. My main concern all these years in the church is not sin, but the letter. Many spiritual things look alike from the outside, but within there is no spiritual reality at all.</p><p>In Shanghai a brother once said that a certain person's message is not bad. But others do not touch life when they hear him. The same can be said of our spiritual service. It is not enough to do things well outwardly; there must also be spiritual reality. Others must receive life inwardly; they must be edified. A church can have zeal. It can have good doctrines. Outwardly everything may be in very good order. But if there is no spirit, everything is letter. The church cannot just have an outward show of spirituality; it must live in the spiritual reality.</p><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul said that the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Paul was opposed to the letter, which is the Old Testament Scripture. We can say the same thing today. We must realize that everything is letter without the Spirit. This does not mean that we are spiritual as long as we can give a spiritual message. Being spiritual means that we have touched the spiritual reality. In order for the church to remain in the reality of the spiritual realm, we must first learn to pick up a kind of spiritual consciousness.</p><p>In the meetings, in listening to a message, in prayer, and in preaching the gospel, we have to train our spirit to be sensitive. If others have a spirit and our spirit does not respond, it means that there is something wrong with us. If we cannot use our spirit, our spiritual life will surely wilt away. John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." We do worldly things by our flesh. When a man cannot exercise his flesh, his life comes to an end. In the same way if a Christian cannot use his spirit, he falls to a very low point.</p><p>I do not say this because I have any desire to rebuke you. I am merely trying to share something more related to the matter of spiritual consciousness. We are releasing a burden concerning spiritual consciousness. Paul's quotation of the Old Testament was different from the Pharisees' quotation of the Old Testament. Paul had the spirit, but the Pharisees did not have it (John 5:39-40). In spiritual matters, sameness is not a matter of having common doctrines; there is also a matter of inward reality. Sameness is not merely being the same in everything. Similarity is not the same as to be fully identified with something. There is a world of difference between sameness and similarity. One person can imitate another in voice, tone, and doctrine. All these things can be similar. But without the spirit, all that one has is the letter. The foundation of Christianity lies in the presence of the Holy Spirit. In Matthew 7 the Lord says that before the judgment seat, some will claim that they prophesied, cast out demons, and performed works of power in His name. But the Lord will tell them, "I never knew you" (vv. 22-23). We can be zealous for the Lord's work. We can even cast out demons and perform works of power by exercising authority, but the basic question is not how much we have done, but whether we are born of the flesh or of the Spirit. Only by knowing and cultivating a spiritual consciousness will our action be something born of the Spirit. Only this will be accepted by the Lord.</p><p>Hence, outward sameness does not necessarily mean that we have the same thing. Many people come to Hong Kong and have many things to say about the church. I know that these criticisms are wrong. They are mainly reasonings and opinions. It is absolutely useless to argue about outward practices; there is no spirit in it. One brother came to Hong Kong and criticized the practice here; he considered it inferior to the practices in Shanghai and Taipei. But the real question is whether or not there is the spirit. If there is the spirit, we have the sameness, and everything is well. Today in Hong Kong everything is good, but there is a great shortage in spiritual consciousness. We must thoroughly learn our lessons here. Some may think that this is a very hard lesson to learn. Actually, this is not hard at all. It may not be that easy to discern the proper pathway from the positive side, but we can at least discern our mistakes from the negative side.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS</h2><h2 class="head2">One Must Be a Regenerated Person</h2><p>Brother Chu: How do we exercise ourselves to develop a spiritual consciousness?</p><p>Watchman Nee: In order to answer this question we have to come back to the starting point&mdash;regeneration. Suppose we try to explain the colors white and red to a man who is born blind. We may tell him that something that looks white is white or something that looks red is red. But He will not understand what we are saying. Even if the blind man is very intelligent, he will not understand what color is. Intelligence and color are things that belong to two different worlds.</p><p>In John 3 the Lord Jesus said that unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God (v. 3). He meant that in order to know the things of God's kingdom, that is, in order to know the spiritual things, one must be born again. The things related to God's kingdom, the things of the spirit, cannot be understood by a man of flesh. One can only understand it as his spiritual consciousness develops. In order to have spiritual consciousness, one has to begin from regeneration. After a man is regenerated, the Lord plants a spiritual consciousness within him.</p><h2 class="head2">A Thorough Consecration</h2><p>Second, you must have a thorough consecration. This is what Romans 12:1-2 speaks of in presenting ourselves as a living sacrifice, being transformed by the renewing of the mind, and then proving God's will. Some people are indeed saved. In fact they have been saved for many years already. But we cannot get through with them concerning any spiritual thing. They are like a piece of wood or stone when it comes to spiritual things. They have no spiritual feeling at all. This is because they have a problem with their consecration. In the church we can find brothers and sisters who experience a sudden opening of their understanding. If we trace the cause of this opening, we will discover that these ones have made a thorough consecration before the Lord. To a Christian, consecration is the necessary step after regeneration. We can talk to some people about any worldly matter from music to politics to philosophy. They may be good at them all, but when you talk to them about spiritual things, they may not understand anything. Only spiritual ones can discern spiritual things. Worldly wisdom and human cleverness cannot discern spiritual things (1 Cor. 2:8, 10).</p><p>The word mind in Romans 12 is nous in Greek. It can be translated as understanding. Formerly, our spirit was dead. Through the quickening of the Holy Spirit, it is now able to communicate with God. But we still need the renewing of our understanding before we can know the good, well pleasing, and perfect will of God revealed to us in our spirit. Our understanding needs to be renewed all the time. The spiritual consciousness of the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong is weak because their understanding is not renewed.</p><p>Please forgive me for saying a frank word. A person is dull in his spiritual consciousness because his understanding is not renewed, and his understanding is not renewed because he has a problem with his consecration. I have not seen a man who is truly and thoroughly consecrated who has a dull spirit. A thoroughly consecrated person is one who is a living sacrifice all the time. The stronger the consecration, the more the understanding opens up. Only consecration will give the Holy Spirit the proper ground He owns in the church. Once we hold back anything in our consecration, the Holy Spirit is frustrated from gaining the full ground in the church. Hence, consecration is an indispensable step in removing the negative hindrances.</p><h2 class="head2">Having the Faculties Exercised</h2><p>After one has a renewed understanding, he must still have his faculties exercised. He must be able to touch the spirit's feelings. Hebrews 5 says that the faculties must be exercised for discriminating between both good and evil. To be exercised means to learn to follow the feeling of the Holy Spirit. Romans 12 speaks of the renewing of the understanding, while Hebrews 5 speaks of the exercising of the faculties. This means to learn to respond to the sense of the Holy Spirit within us. This is analogous to the growth of a child. In the process of his growth, he learns different things, and he develops different sets of feelings. When he is young, he has one set of feelings. When he grows up, he has another set of feelings. A brother or sister starts his or her learning from the time he or she is regenerated. A young man of twenty years old must be very careful about how he develops his emotion and mind. He has to grow in the right direction. By forty years old, he can be considered a grown up and mature person. The same can be said of our spiritual consciousness; we have to exercise ourselves to develop it as early as possible. You have to know what is the restraining of the Spirit, what is the urging of the Spirit, the leading of the Spirit, and the forbidding of the Spirit. If you do not know these things, you are still a child as far as being a Christian is concerned. You are like a forty-year-old man with a sensitivity of a ten-year-old boy.</p><p>A Christian is different from a person in the world. You cannot live by the set of feelings you acquired in your physical growth. You have to acquire a new set of feelings, the spiritual feelings you received at the time of your regeneration. Let me repeat this word again and again to the elders: If the leading ones are not quick and sharp enough in spiritual consciousness, the whole church will be led astray; there will not be the manifestation of the authority of the Holy Spirit. If you do not know the activities of the Holy Spirit within you individually, there is no way for the Holy Spirit to get through in the church. A blind man has one set of feelings. However, once his eyes are opened, he will have another set of feelings. The set of feelings a Christian acquires after regeneration is very special. If you do not learn to exercise them, you will not be able to help the brothers and sisters develop a spiritual consciousness. There are many feelings which are hard to explain; you can only acquire them through practice. If you do not practice, you will not be conscious of anything even when your feelings go astray. This is like a blind man whose consciousness of everything is black.</p><p>We have to pray to the Lord that He would maintain our consecration. This is a lesson that goes on for the rest of our life. No one can say that he has graduated in the matter of consecration. We cannot make any mistake in our consecration. We have to maintain its freshness. After this we have to learn to exercise our spirit and acquire spiritual feelings. We should not try to touch things with our mind. A blind man is very exercised in his auditory faculty. He exercises his ears not only to listen to the radio but to everything around him. But once his eyes are open, he will try to see everything; he will exercise his seeing faculty. He will even try to examine the radio receiver with his eyes. Before a person is saved, he pays much attention to his mind, emotion, and will. He uses these faculties a great deal. But after he is saved, he can no longer be carried away by the vain mind, the old emotion, and the weak will in discerning the spiritual things. Instead, he has to exercise his spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP REGARDING SERVICE</h2><p>The responsible brothers in a district should only bear responsibility for spiritual matters. They should step forward only when the other brothers and sisters cannot fulfill their functions. Even then they should not monopolize everything. The meetings should be under the control of the Holy Spirit. Whether they act or not, they have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. For this reason the elders must have spiritual feelings and must be able to direct the meetings in the right direction. All the other brothers and sisters should be trained and taught how to meet. In the meetings the sisters cannot teach, but they can call hymns and testify. In the prayer meetings and bread-breaking meetings, the sisters should pray in the middle of the meeting. They should not initiate or conclude the meetings with their prayers. They should also avoid calling hymns as much as possible, unless they are clear they have the prompting of the Spirit. If anyone makes a mistake in the meeting, there is no need to correct him immediately unless, of course, the mistake is very serious. After the meeting those who made the mistakes should be given some fellowship in love. If a brother does something wrong in the meeting, it is improper for others to keep silent in the meeting yet speak behind his back after the meeting. We should speak to the erring one. But it is not love when we speak behind his back, not to his face. It is inevitable for some to make mistakes in the meetings. The only way we can be sure that everything is right is if we call the hymns, pray, and do everything ourselves. But then we will monopolize the entire meeting. On the one hand, we have to allow the brothers and sisters to function. On the other hand, all of them need to be adjusted and perfected. Otherwise, they will never learn. All the responsible ones in all the "homes" (i.e., districts) should meet once a week. At other times there should be many love feasts in the small groups. The number in each group should not be too large.</p><p>The sixth "home" has too few saints because the brothers and sisters there were somewhat separated from the church in the past. In the future we need many gospel meetings in this district. The brothers and sisters must also bring new ones to the meetings. Do not ask people to sign in all the time. The districts in Chan's home and Shen's home should take care of the new immigrants as soon as possible. They should arrange visits to these new arrivals within the shortest possible time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL FEELINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Evening, February 28, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Scripture Reading:Gen. 2:7; Ezek. 36:26-27; Luke 9:55; John 3:6; 4:23-24; 6:63; Rom. 7:6; Phil. 3:3; 1:19; Gal. 5:25</h1><p>Witness Lee: Lord, how we need the cleansing of Your precious blood. There are still many unclean and impure things within us. Lord, we need Your mercy. Forgive our past shortcomings. May we come to You once again with full assurance to receive mercy and grace for our timely help. Lord, grant us Your revelation and shine into our hearts. Unless You do this, our understanding will not be open even when we have Your word. Open our understanding even tonight so that we will see what we have not seen before. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH GOD</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Today we will speak on the subject of spiritual feelings and how to walk according to the spirit. The feeling in our spirit originates from the Holy Spirit; when the Holy Spirit moves within our spirit, we acquire a certain kind of feeling. Our mind, however, does not require the Holy Spirit to activate it. It can think and consider by itself. A Christian communicates with God through the spirit. God's Spirit lives in our spirit. We sense the move of God's Spirit by our spirit, and we communicate with Him, know Him, and know His will through this spirit. It is understandable for a person to exercise his mind all the time before he is saved. But it is inexcusable for a saved person to use his mind to replace the operation of the Holy Spirit. If a Christian has never learned to follow the Holy Spirit, he will not know what the feeling of the Spirit is. As the Holy Spirit moves within us and we touch the feeling of the Spirit, we exercise our mind to think and to translate this feeling in our spirit. This is the right way. It is useless, however, if the Holy Spirit prompts us and our mind is still occupied by our own things.</p><p>Many people think that clever ones understand God's things faster, and dull ones understand them slower. But this is not what the Lord's Word says. The Lord's Word says that He will destroy the wisdom of the wise and set aside the understanding of those who understand (1 Cor. 1:19). The Lord places the wise and the foolish on the same level. The wisest mind and the most foolish mind are equally worthless before God. Both need to be renewed. God does not need man to be His counselor. "Who has become His counselor?" (Rom. 11:34). Who can be God's advisor? God only acts according to His own will; He does not act according to man's reasons. God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" (9:13). Again He said, "I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion" (v. 15). This means that God only acts according to His will; He does not act according to reason, judgment, or fairness. If we follow God according to reason, judgment, and fairness, we are asking Him to follow our reason. But we are God's slaves; we are nothing but dust. We can only prostrate ourselves before His throne. How can we reason with Him?</p><p>There is no other way than to obey and follow the Holy Spirit's prompting within us. We can only stand on the ground of obedience. We cannot stand on the ground of interference. We cannot be God's counselor. The mind only reasons and argues. It only considers whether or not reason allows and permits something. God does not want us to argue with Him. He wants us to walk according to His will. A man can argue with his friends, but a father of thirty or more years does not need to argue with a three- to five-year-old child. If the child asks why they have to move, the father does not need to give a reason. Our God is far greater than us. His glory is unapproachable to man. Even if He revealed only a millionth of His glory to us, we would have no place to go but to fall on our face and drop our reasons. To follow God, we cannot exercise our reasoning faculty, that is, our mind. We have to use another organ, our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE ORGAN TO KNOW GOD'S WILL</h2><p>The organ or faculty by which we know God's will is the spirit; it is by the sense of the spirit that we know God's will. Only the spirit knows God and contacts God; the mind cannot know God. If we only exercise our mind, we cannot touch or feel the Holy Spirit. This is like a blind man who does not respond to color at all. Only our spiritual organ can touch the Spirit and feel Him. It is as useless to apply the mind to God's things as it is for a blind man to try to identify color with his ears. First Corinthians 2:11-12 says that no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. We can know the things of God because God gave us a new spirit when we were saved (Ezek. 36:26). This spirit enables us to feel and touch His Holy Spirit. He also gave us His Holy Spirit, who reveals to us the things of God.</p><p>When the Holy Spirit is in us, He puts feelings within our spirit. He prompts us to be quick, slow, move, or stop. By exercising our spiritual sense, we know how to act and move. This is like a horse with a bridle in its mouth. The rider only needs to hold the reins to direct the move of the horse. As soon as he pulls the reins a little, the horse knows whether to turn, to move forward, to slow down, or to speed up. The horse only needs to know a few kinds of tugs to move according to its rider's directions. The rider only needs to urge or pull back a little and the horse will be under his full control. In the same way, the Holy Spirit gives us feelings within. As soon as we speak too much, He disciplines us. Once we deviate, He rebukes. A brother once said that before he was saved, he was the star of every banquet, but he could no longer act the same way after he was saved. If he spoke one word too many at a banquet, he would lose his joy when he returned home. Formerly, the more others listened to him, the happier he felt. Now the more others listen to him, the worse he feels. This is the leading of the Holy Spirit. Suppose you feel that you should preach the gospel to a certain person. The Holy Spirit has prompted you and directed you. He has given you this feeling in your spirit. If you act according to His leading, you will have joy and peace. Walking in the Holy Spirit means following the inward move of the Holy Spirit. A horse does not need to consider what it should do. It only needs to follow the instructions of the rider on its back. It only needs to learn a few feelings. It can act boldly according to these feelings. Once we know the various feelings of the Holy Spirit in our spirit, we can walk according to the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING EXERCISED IN SPIRITUAL FEELINGS</h2><p>Every saved person has feelings in his spirit. But these feelings must be exercised before a person can become experienced in them. A man who is born blind has very sensitive fingers and ears. In the church in Shanghai, a few blind brothers lived next door to the meeting hall. As soon as we mentioned any one of them by name, they would come over and ask what we were talking about. But once a blind man's eyes are opened and he sees the colorful world around him, he will adjust the feelings of his other faculties to accomodate the feeling of his eyes. He cannot replace his visual sense with the senses of his other faculties any longer. Similarly, after we are saved, the feeling of the spirit is recovered, and we must learn to not substitute the spirit's feeling with the senses of the other faculties.</p><p>A blind man cannot appreciate the beauty of a gold-edged Bible. If you ask him to touch the Bible, he cannot feel the gold edge. The hand cannot replace the eyes. In the same way, the mind cannot replace the spirit to feel the leading of the Holy Spirit. If a blind man's eyes are opened today, he may still depend on his touch to "feel" objects. Although he has acquired a new seeing organ, he is not used to it. Similarly, although many Christians have received a new faculty&mdash;a spiritual sense&mdash;after regeneration, they cannot understand spiritual things because they are still inexperienced in their practice. It would be a joke for a blind man's eyes to be opened and he still not exercise his seeing faculty. When he is blind, he can only touch the Bible with his hands; he can only feel its shape. But once he sees, he only needs to exercise his eyes to see the shape and form. Before a person is saved, he can resort to the methods of the blind, guessing God's will with his mind and reasons (Acts 17:27). But once he is saved, he has a new spirit, and he should no longer resort to the methods he employed before he had this new spirit. He should no longer guess at the will of the Holy Spirit with his mind and intellect. To do so would be like setting aside the faculty of the eyes and touching the Bible with the hand to see if it is red. This is foolish. If we do not use our spirit, we will not be able to discern many spiritual things. The Holy Spirit directs us by "remote control" through our new spirit. Without the spirit, we cannot receive the signal the Holy Spirit is sending us, and we cannot move in God's direction.</p><p>John 3:6 says that once a man is regenerated, he receives a new spirit from the Holy Spirit. John 4:24 continues by saying that God is Spirit, and that we have to worship Him in spirit. In addition to our new spirit, there is another Spirit&mdash;the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit who is in God is today also dwelling in our spirit. When the Spirit in God moves, the Holy Spirit within us also moves. Such a move becomes a prompting in our spirit, gives our spirit a consciousness, and directs it to move. By this we learn to communicate with God through the feeling in our spirit. Suppose a man is born blind, but at the age of thirty his eyes are opened. In a manner of speaking, his other senses have reached the age of thirty already. But his seeing faculty is younger than that of a child in kindergarten. In the same way, a saved and regenerated person may be fifty years old physically, but his spiritual age may only be one or two days old. If a man has been regenerated for fifty years, his spirit has been exercised all this time, and he has been following the feeling of the Holy Spirit, his spiritual faculty may be fifty years old as well. A man with good eyes can stretch his view as far as twenty miles, but his hands can at most extend two to three feet. If he does not exercise his eyes, preferring instead to only use his hands, his sphere of perception will not extend very far. Hebrews 5:12 says that according to the amount of time some believers have spent in their learning, they should be teachers, but they are still babies. This tells us that our spiritual senses have to grow. Our spiritual consciousness has to be exercised. The church in Hong Kong is short in the exercise of spiritual senses. Many brothers and sisters are very inexperienced with their spiritual senses. Personally, the foundation of our Christian faith is built upon our spiritual senses. If a Christian constantly exercises his mind, intellect, reasoning, and memory, and does not exercise his spirit, he will remain an outsider as far as spiritual things are concerned.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE MIND</h2><p>Some may ask about the function of the mind. I am not saying that the mind is useless. The function of the mind is very much related to the function of the spirit. God communicates with us in our spirit, but He also communicates through our mind. What is the relationship between the function of the mind and the function of the spirit? The mind is the organ by which we understand the feeling of the spirit. Before the Lord we must first have an open spirit to establish a living communication with Him. After we understand the leading of the Holy Spirit, we need to exercise our mind. After a blind man's eyes are opened, he does not discard his ears and hands from that point onward. Instead, he has to learn to adjust his eyes so that they will coordinate properly with his other faculties. Before a man is saved, he lives by his mind. After he is saved, it does not mean that he no longer will need to live by his mind. Rather, he has to learn to coordinate his mind with his spirit. A man whose eyes are opened needs to learn to adjust the other faculties of his body to his eyes. When he needs to use his eyes, he should use his eyes. He should no longer be the same as before, touching with his hand and listening with his ears instead of seeing with his eyes. We should deal with spiritual things the same way. After we are saved, we should not deal with spiritual things only with our mind. We should instead coordinate our faculties with our spirit, feel with our spirit, and then understand and express these feelings with our mind. This is what Paul meant when he said that he prayed and sang with his spirit and he also prayed and sang with his mind (1 Cor. 14:15).</p><p>There are two functions related to the exercise of our mind:</p><h2 class="head2">Translating the Thoughts of the Spirit</h2><p>First John 3:24, Romans 8:9, and 1 Corinthians 2:12 all speak of the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit. This is the "divine output" of God. The Holy Spirit in our spirit joins us to God. On the one hand, the Holy Spirit is in God. On the other hand, He is also in our spirit. We can say that this Holy Spirit is our spirit because He dwells in our spirit. But we can also say that He is God's Spirit because the Holy Spirit is of God. This is the reason that the original text in the Epistles often does not clearly point to the Holy Spirit or to our spirit when the word spirit is used. In reality, it is hard to differentiate between the human spirit and God's Holy Spirit because His Holy Spirit is now living in man's spirit.</p><p>Therefore, when the Holy Spirit of God moves within our spirit, the latter feels it immediately. But even though our spirit feels it, our outer man does not know about it, and we have to interpret it with our mind so that we can understand the meaning of this move of God's Holy Spirit within us. Suppose we are doing something, and there is a prompting within our spirit to stop. Our spirit has been touched, but we have to interpret it with our mind before we know that it is wrong and that we should stop immediately. This is the function of the mind. The same is true with our speaking. Suppose we ask a certain person if he wants to go to another place with us. The Spirit may touch us to not ask this question, but our mind has to interpret it before we realize that He does not want us to go on. Then we should shut up. The function of the mind is to enable us to know the feeling of the Holy Spirit in our spirit. We can call this function a kind of interpretation. It interprets the will of the Spirit to our outer man.</p><h2 class="head2">Fulfilling the Ministry of the Word</h2><p>The second function of the mind is to help us in the ministry of the word. The move of the Holy Spirit in our spirit is like sending Morse code. In order to understand this code, we need a code book to interpret it. Our mind must have this interpreting ability before others can understand what God has revealed in our spirit. In order for the mind to have such a capacity, it must be trained and it must learn. Suppose there is a kind of prompting in our spirit. We feel that God wants us to say something about consecration. Yet in our prayer and study of God's Word, we do not feel any breakthrough; there does not seem to be the utterance. Afterwards we feel that we should speak about faith instead. Once we make this decision, we feel released, and the utterance flows out of us; our spirit begins to respond, and everything falls into place. When we come to the meeting, we speak according to the feeling in our spirit. Perhaps the Holy Spirit will help us to continue with the speaking, or the feeling in the spirit may stop, which means that we should stop as well. This is how we exercise the faculty of the mind. At the beginning we select one topic out of many topics. Afterwards we refine the search and pick out the words that God wants us to say. Finally, we speak the very things that God wants us to speak.</p><h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>In our daily life we have to walk according to the leading of God's Spirit. Our mind can help us in receiving guidance from the Holy Spirit; it can help us to make decisions in our daily life. Suppose we are responsible for keeping the record of the saints in the church. What kind of form should we use? There are over ten different kinds of forms we can choose from. When we pick up one, we feel peaceful within. That is the right one. That is the one that God wants. After we have selected the form, we have to decide when we will print it and when we will pass it out to the brothers and sisters. In all of these matters, we have to act according to the inward feeling. If we need a form, yet do not have the right mind to design or choose one, our spirit will be bound because God's will is not being carried out. This shows that man's mind can aid the spirit. Suppose we saw a thief crawling into our neighbor's house last night. Today the police station summons us, and we are shown many photographs of suspects. In examining them, we find one which resembles the man we saw last night. We can identify him because he left a strong impression on us. This is the way the mind works with the spirit. When the mind comes across something that matches the feeling of the spirit, the spirit is released. Sometimes people come up with many points in their mind, but their spirit cannot say amen to these points. Another may present a few points from his mind, and the spirit responds immediately. This shows that our mind must be properly trained. Otherwise, we will be like a policeman presenting an identifier with eighty thousand pictures. If there are too many choices, whatever impression we have may vanish. We have to train our mind to the extent that our spirit will respond with an amen as soon as we touch a matter. Many times saints ask, "Why am I always wrong and other persons are always right in our coordination together?" I always answer, "You have all the reasons, but something within you cannot say amen. What are you going to do?" We are not here to know whether our reasons are good or bad. We are here to see if our spirit says amen.</p><h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE WITH THE SPIRIT<br />AND PRAYING BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Let us now consider how we can follow the sense of the spirit in our reading of the Bible and in prayer. There are two ways to read the Bible and pray. One way is by the mind. The other way is by the spirit. If we only use our mind, not our spirit, the words of the Bible will become letters to us. This is like a body that is without life; it is merely a corpse. It is true that the mind helps us understand teachings and doctrines, but if the Holy Spirit does not move, we will not receive any life (John 5:39-40). The Holy Spirit is in God. The Spirit is also in the words of the Bible (6:63; cf. 2 Tim. 3:16). Within us there is also the Spirit. If a man does not have the Spirit within him, he does not have life. If a word of the Bible does not have the Spirit behind it, it is not God's speaking. The problem is that there are two kinds of words of the Holy Spirit. One is the outward word of the letter. The other is the word of the Spirit. The word we have touched depends on which organ we are using. We can only touch the Spirit in the Bible if we exercise our spirit. Suppose Brother Ma and Brother Chia are colleagues at work. They only have business contact with each other in the office; there is no spiritual communication or fellowship. Although both are Christians, neither knows about the other's conviction. One day they meet each other in the cashier's office, and each wants to preach the gospel to the other and bring the other to the church to hear the gospel. Then they discover that both are Christians. In this way they become related to each other on a different level&mdash;the spiritual level. From that time onward, the two not only have business contact, but spiritual contact as well. In the same way we have a spirit within us, and the Spirit is within the letter of the Bible. If we do not use our spirit, our outer man will only touch the physical Bible; we will not touch the Spirit within the Bible. The Bible says that a prophet is not without honor except in his own country (Matt. 13:57). This is because one's own countrymen know his background and everything related to him. They can only know him by the outward flesh; they cannot know him by the spirit. When we come to the Bible, there are doctrines, teachings, and knowledge. But if we know it only by these outward things, we only will have doctrines, teachings, and knowledge. We will not touch the Spirit which speaks from behind the Bible.</p><p>Our fellowship is not merely a matter of inviting a brother over to eat and drink; it is the communication of our spirit with others' spirit. Fellowship is not a few cups of tea, a dish of snacks, or five hours of conversation. Fellowship is the communication of spirits. Our spirit must be always ready, like a weak and hungry man ready for food. If we come to the Word thus prepared, we will receive the supply of life from God's Word. There are two kinds of words in the Bible: black and white letters, and words that supply our spirit with life and power, satisfying our inward needs. In reading the Bible, we should not touch the doctrines of the Bible only but also should receive the supply in our spirit.</p><p>Likewise, listening to a message requires the exercise of the spirit. If we listen to a message and are only impressed with the eloquence, the clarity of mind, and the lucid logic of the speaker, we only have knowledge and doctrine. In order to receive supply from the speaker, we have to exercise our spirit to contact the spirit behind the words. Then we will receive help not only from his words but from his spirit as well.</p><p>The proper attitude in reading the Bible is to have our spirit stronger than our mind. We should be like the baby bird during times of feeding; its mouth is bigger than its head. The mind is one mouth, but there needs to be another mouth&mdash;the spirit's mouth. If we practice this, our spirit will be greatly uplifted and fully nourished after a meeting. This is the reason our spirit must be wide open. If the spirits of all the brothers and sisters are wide open, we can tell whether or not a speaker is exercising his spirit. This does not mean that those who speak louder and stronger are exercising their spirit. It is not a matter of how loud the voice is or how polished the eloquence is. It is a matter of the echo in the spirit and the supply in the spirit. A man's mind can be deceived, but a man's spirit cannot be deceived. If we have the spirit, we have the spirit. If we do not have the spirit, we do not have the spirit. Some messages are structured with good introductions and conclusions, but they do not necessarily convey the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2><p>In reading the Bible and listening to messages, we have to learn to exercise our spirit. In our daily life, we have to ask ourselves continually, "Do I have the spirit when I am doing this?" The temptation of young people is to use their mind and to neglect their spirit. The first fall of man came about when he used his mind and neglected his spirit. A young man once asked me, "I have been studying theology for eight years. Every day I study the Bible for over ten hours. Why do I still not have any light?" I answered him, "Your mistake lies in your presupposition; you suppose that you will receive light by spending more time and effort. This is not possible. If this were the case, unbelievers could read the Bible and receive light as well." Only spiritual men can understand spiritual things. Only they can grasp the spiritual things. The same can be said about the practice of the ministry of the word. Only a spiritual man, one who exercises his spirit, can have light and revelation. In every aspect of our spiritual living, we have to exercise our spirit more than our mind.</p><p>A man can speak humble words, but this does not mean that he is a humble person, even though a humble person will always speak humble words. Similarly, a man can deliver spiritual messages, but this does not mean that he is a spiritual person, even though a spiritual person always delivers a spiritual message. A speaker should bear the Holy Spirit "upon his shoulder" and carry Him to others. The Holy Spirit is willing to let Himself be carried with some people, but He is not willing to let Himself be carried with others. If we want to carry the Holy Spirit, we must be spiritual persons who exercise the spirit. Some people may not be that clear with their messages. Their grammar may be all wrong. However, the Holy Spirit is able to use them to subdue others because they have the spirit. It is wrong for anyone to try to substitute the spirit with the word. This is actually impossible.</p><p>Some people have spirits that are of high, reliable, and of sterling quality. Others' spirits are low in quality. Mr. T. Austin-Sparks's words do not match his spirit. His spirit is of very high quality. When you hear Mr. Sparks pray, you can sense that his spirit is high, clean, and pure. We need a clean and strong spirit. Some people have a clean spirit, but it is weak. In my whole life I have only met two people who prayed with a strong and clean spirit&mdash;Brother Sparks and Miss Barber. The young ones must begin learning now. They must ask themselves again and again, "Does my speaking have the spirit? Is my spirit strong? Is it clean?" All the brothers and sisters must practice this until they become very experienced.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2><p>In order to have sensitive spiritual feelings and to walk according to the spirit, there are three conditions which we have to meet. First, we must be genuinely regenerated. Second, we must have an absolute consecration. Third, we must practice. If we have these three things, our spiritual consciousness will greatly increase after three months. In the coming days, when the brothers and sisters work together in coordination, they must not only take care of the business but also take care of their spirit in the course of their work. Learn to do nothing apart from the spirit. Whatever we do in the meeting, we must first ask, "Am I doing this apart from the spirit?" Whether we are singing, praying, or testifying, we have to do it with the spirit. Otherwise, we may be exhausting the brothers' and sisters' spirit. It is not a matter of opening or not opening the mouth but a matter of following the spirit. It is wrong if we open our mouth but do not use our spirit. It is also wrong, of course, if we do not open our mouth. We are not exhorting you to open your mouth, and we are not exhorting you to shut up. We are exhorting you instead to follow the Holy Spirit and to exercise your spirit. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit. If all the brothers and sisters can learn and practice this lesson, our spiritual feeling will become very keen, and God will do great things in the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(7)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: March 1, 1950<br />Place: Jordan Road, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Principles Operating in the Church</h2><p>There are two spiritual principles in the church. The first is authority. The other side of authority is submission. If the church does not have authority, it will be filled with the flesh. If there is only authority, however, the church will be full of the law; it will be like a law court. Therefore, the second thing is love. Only love builds up.</p><h2 class="head2">Arrangements for the Services</h2><p>In order to carry out the visitation work in an orderly fashion, we have divided the visitation into a few smaller groups and asked a few brothers and sisters to take charge of them: 1) transportation of out-of-town visitors, 2) special visitations, 3) correspondence, 4) &ldquo;nursing mothers,&rdquo; and 5) love feasts. (In Greek the word <i>agape</i> means &ldquo;love&rdquo; only.)</p><p>The scope of service of the deacons&rsquo; office includes all the details of the business affairs of the church. The affairs of the church are complicated. Therefore, we cannot ask one individual to head up this matter. Instead, the fourteen deacons should take turns heading up this work.</p><h2 class="head2">Neither Democracy nor Authoritarianism</h2><p>Every institution in the world has rules of conduct for the facilitation and order of conducting business. In order to facilitate and order the spiritual things in the church, there are also rules of conduct. Before the brothers and sisters handed themselves over, it was impossible for the whole church to rise up to serve; many held to the concept that as long as someone was taking care of the responsibilities, they could sit back. Now everything is different. All the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over, and the whole church has risen up to serve. Every brother and sister must have a part in the things related to the church. There is the need of some kind of arrangement because so many people are serving in the church. Without this, it will be easy to fall into confusion. In making decisions, the worldly way is to vote by hand or ballot. The minority yields to the majority. In some places authoritarianism prevails. In such places one man or a few men decide everything. Today there are ways of conducting business in every secular society. The way to serve in the church, however, is different from the way of the world. Church service is according to God&rsquo;s revelation in His Word. We must take the biblical way of making decisions in the church. If the church does not take the biblical way of making decisions, I am afraid worldly ways will creep in.</p><p>The last church spoken of in Revelation 2 and 3 is the church in Laodicea. It comes after the church in Philadelphia. The Lord&rsquo;s word to the last church is very strong. The word <i>Laodicea</i> is <i>Laodikeia</i> in Greek. It is made up of two words: <i>laos </i>and <i>dikeia.</i> <i>Laos</i> means the people, and <i>dikeia</i> means three things according to the lexicon: 1) customs and habits, 2) rights, 3) demands, judgments, and revenge. Hence, the word <i>Laodicea</i> means the people&rsquo;s customs, rights, and judgments. The best way to express it is &ldquo;people&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo; In Revelation 2 and 3, the word <i>laos</i> is used three times. Two times it is embedded in the word <i>Nicolaitan.</i> In the original language, <i>Nicolaitan</i> is <i>nikolaos.</i> Its root <i>nikos</i> means to subjugate. <i>Laos,</i> of course, means people. <i>Nicolaitan,</i> therefore, means those who subjugate the people. In Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord specifically pointed out His rejection and hatred of both <i>Laodikeia</i> and <i>Nikolaos.</i> It is wrong to resort to pressure and subjugation in the church services. It is equally wrong to resort to the principle of the majority. According to the opinion of the majority, Christ was condemned and crucified (Matt. 27:21-23). It is wrong for church affairs to be determined by one person or a few persons. In the Catholic Church, the pope decides everything by himself in the Vatican. This is the work of the Nicolaitans.</p><h2 class="head2">The Pattern of Acts 15</h2><p>On what basis then do we serve in the church? The Lord has not left it to us to decide the method of making judgments in the church. He gave us one chapter as a pattern&mdash;the conference in Acts 15. The conference in Acts 15 is spiritual, not worldly. It is neither autocratic nor democratic. In Acts 15 the church discussed and deliberated by spiritual methods. Without the record of this conference, we would not know what to do with our service or the management of our business.</p><p>We should first consider the background of this conference in Acts 15. The church in Jerusalem can be considered the &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; among all the churches. Christ once ministered there, and the twelve apostles labored there for a long time. Even the gospel spread out from the Christians in Jerusalem. Many Christians were produced through Jerusalem. Later, after Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch from their first mission, they faced a great trial; some from the church in Jerusalem came to Antioch and taught that all believers had to be circumcised according to the law of Moses and that if they were not circumcised, they were not saved. Paul and Barnabas debated with them fiercely. The two were clear that if a man who believes in Christ cannot be justified and remains a sinner, it means that Christ has died for nothing (Gal. 2:17-21). For this reason, the church can never mix salvation with things of the Jewish background, including circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, and ordinances related to eating, etc. If such things were allowed to mix with salvation, other teachings would eventually come in. A man would be told that he could not be saved unless he did other things, such as obtain a university degree or practice vegetarianism, etc. In China, if the teaching of Confucius is allowed to come in, many will say that a man cannot be saved unless he honors his parents or practices universal compassion, etc. But this is not the gospel of Christ. The gospel says that anyone can believe in the Lord and be saved. The teaching that one can only be saved through keeping the law came from Jerusalem. Therefore, Paul and Barnabas had to go up to Jerusalem to fellowship with the church. They were not the only ones. Other brothers from the church in Antioch also went with them.</p><h2 class="head3">All the Brothers Can Speak</h2><p>After Paul and Barnabas arrived in Jerusalem, they did not go to Peter immediately. Instead, they went to &ldquo;the apostles and elders&rdquo; (Acts 15:2). &ldquo;They were received by the church and the apostles and the elders&rdquo; (v. 4). Then the apostles and elders invited the brothers to come for a meeting. When something happens, the whole church comes together to fellowship about it. Everyone is qualified to speak. The responsible brothers have to listen to the other brothers and sisters. Decisions are made by the elderly brothers, but these elderly brothers must listen to all the other brothers and sisters, because among the speaking of the brothers and sisters may be found the voice of the Holy Spirit. Because the senior ones have been dealt with by the Lord, they can make the decisions before the Lord after listening to the brothers and sisters. In this conference, some believers who were Pharisees first stood up and said, &ldquo;It is necessary to circumcise them and to charge them to keep the law of Moses&rdquo; (v. 5). Around this point there was much dispute. This means that many brothers spoke and expressed their views.</p><h2 class="head3">Peter Spoke</h2><p>&ldquo;And when much discussion had taken place...&rdquo; (v. 7a). All the arguments were presented, and then Peter stood up and spoke. He told everyone of his experience at the house of Cornelius. He was saying that Paul was not the first one to preach to the Gentiles. Rather, &ldquo;from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe&rdquo; (v. 7b). Following this, it seems Peter was saying, &ldquo;We the Jews have our religious background. We think that it is a small thing to be circumcised and to keep the Sabbath. But to the Gentiles, this is an unbearable yoke. We should not place such a yoke upon these Gentiles&rdquo; (v. 10). In the house of Cornelius, the Gentiles first received the Holy Spirit, and then Peter baptized them. The Lord did something first. He confirmed what He did by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Peter testified that as soon as he opened his mouth, the Holy Spirit descended upon them just as He descended upon the disciples at the beginning (11:15). At Pentecost the order was reversed; Peter finished his preaching, followed by the disciples&rsquo; baptism, and then they received the gift of the Holy Spirit (2:38). If what happened in the house of Cornelius was the same as what happened at Pentecost, it would not have been that miraculous. But in Cornelius&rsquo;s house, Peter had barely opened his mouth before the Holy Spirit poured Himself out. This proves that the Holy Spirit was eager to do this. The Jewish Pharisaical believers were arguing about dead doctrines. Peter was talking about the work of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">Paul and Barnabas Spoke</h2><p>After Peter finished, all the attendants were silent. At that juncture Paul and Barnabas related &ldquo;all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them&rdquo; (15:12).</p><h2 class="head3">Finally James Made the Decision</h2><p>Finally James stood up and spoke. &ldquo;And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me&rdquo; (v. 13). In verse 19, James gave the conference a final verdict. In this conference, the first group&rsquo;s speaking was a kind of preparation. These were the Jewish brothers. Then Peter spoke, followed by Paul and Barnabas. Lastly, James made the final decision.</p><h2 class="head2">The Application of Acts 15</h2><p>We can apply this pattern to ourselves. A decision is not made according to the opinion of the majority. Instead, when the church comes together, all the brothers and sisters can speak and debate. At the end, the elders make a decision. Before the final decision is made, all the brothers can speak. Peter could speak. Paul and Barnabas could also speak. When James spoke, a final decision was reached.</p><h2 class="head2">The Question Facing Us Today: Who Is James?</h2><p>Our question today is: Who is James? In other words, who today has the qualification to stand in the leading position to make the final decision? First, we must consider how James became the leader. We will then know how spiritual leaders are produced in general.</p><p>In the Bible, six Jameses are mentioned. The James in the conference in Acts 15 was the brother in the flesh of the Lord Jesus. He spoke a few times in the New Testament. The New Testament mentions his name ten times. At the beginning of the church life, the leading one was Peter. He took the lead to preach the gospel. Later, Peter and John went down to Samaria (8:14). Peter also went to the house of Cornelius. After the house of Cornelius, seemingly Peter gradually lost his leading position in the church. In Acts 12 the church experienced great persecution. One of the twelve apostles, another James, was killed. Peter was imprisoned. It was at that juncture that James rose up, and Peter lost his leading position. Here we see that spiritual leadership is not a matter of experience. It is not like political elections in the world where a president may be elected for a term of six years. Rather, it is a matter of learning. Whoever learns more before the Lord and advances more takes the lead.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 15:5-7 Paul spoke of many persons. But he only mentioned the names of James and Peter. For the others, he only said &ldquo;five hundred brothers,&rdquo; &ldquo;the twelve,&rdquo; and &ldquo;all the apostles.&rdquo; Even the name of John was not mentioned. This means there must have been something special about James. This is the only reason Paul could have mentioned him. This is not all. In Galatians 1:18-19, Paul only mentioned the names of two apostles: Peter and James the brother of the Lord. In 2:9 Paul said again that James, Peter, and John were three pillars in the church in Jerusalem. He placed James before Peter. In 2:12 Paul said, &ldquo;Some came from James&rdquo; to Antioch. He did not say some came from Jerusalem or from Peter. In Acts 12:17 Peter also told the others to inform James of what had happened. At this time there were a few dozen co-workers in Jerusalem and tens of thousands of brothers and sisters. But Peter emphatically said to inform James.</p><p>From the above verses we can see that at the beginning of the church life in Jerusalem, Peter was the first leader. But after Peter was imprisoned, James rose up, even to the point of replacing Peter. This shows us the reason James was the last one to speak in Acts 15. The one who made the final decision in this conference was James, because at that time he was the spiritual leader.</p><h2 class="head2">The Decision of the Spiritual Leader<br />Being the Decision of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>In verse 19 James made the decision: &ldquo;Therefore I judge that...&rdquo; Then in verse 28 he said, &ldquo;For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.&rdquo; This opinion was actually James&rsquo;s decision. In the end it became the decision of the Holy Spirit in conjunction with the entire church. Therefore, we see that the decision of the spiritual leader is the decision of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Only the Holy Spirit Has the Authority</h2><p>When the whole church fellowships together, the brothers and sisters can express their opinion as much as they want. But please remember that expressing your opinion does not mean that things will be done according to your way. When the brothers and sisters speak, the elders must listen. The elders have to learn to listen to the brothers and sisters. They have to see if there is the voice of the Holy Spirit in their speaking. The Gospel of Luke says that when Elizabeth heard the voice of Mary the mother of Jesus, the baby leaped in her womb (1:41). No matter who opens his mouth to speak, the elders must learn to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit through such a one&rsquo;s speaking. When the brothers and sisters speak, often their words are right but their spirit is wrong. The elders must learn to listen and discern.</p><p>A debate can be loud and noisy, but debates in the church end in silence. The ones who make the final decision are the responsible brothers. They have to touch the authority of the Holy Spirit in the church with their spirit and make the final decision accordingly. Church business is not conducted on the basis of the opinion of the elders, but on the basis of what the saints speak and on the spirit of the prophets. The decision of James in Acts 15 was not based on his personal opinion. He first listened to the brothers&rsquo; speaking, Peter&rsquo;s speaking, and Paul and Barnabas&rsquo;s speaking; then he made the final decision based on the word of Amos the prophet (vv. 14-18). The way to conduct business in the church is not by dictatorship. Neither is it by representation or democracy. Decisions in the church are not arrived at through voting or the consensus of a few. Rather the responsible brothers make the decisions. But the responsible brothers must see to it that in spiritual matters, there is the order of spiritual leadership. In the church there is no democracy and there is no dictatorship. We can say the same thing about the deacons. Those who have learned more spiritual lessons spontaneously are in front. Those who have learned less fall behind. Some brothers have learned more, and they stand in the leading position, but this does not mean that they have authority in themselves. They must learn to draw their authority from the Holy Spirit. They do not fight for authority like men scrambling to get on a bus. Authority comes spontaneously. John was always behind Peter. James was at one time behind Peter, but later was ahead of Peter. In the Gospels, James was not yet a believer, but later he rose spiritually. He gained a high stature among the Jewish believers in Jerusalem, inasmuch as Paul attained a high stature among the Gentile believers.</p><p>When the church calls a meeting for fellowship and decision, it does not act on the vote of the majority. Actually, the feeling of the majority often is wrong. Among the seventeen deacons, one must be the leader. Among the five elders, one must be responsible to touch the authority of the Holy Spirit to make the final judgment. If an ordinary brother or sister says something different and the responsible ones feel that this is the will of God, the church must make the decision based on the opinion of that brother or sister. In Acts 15 there were no so-called negotiations. There was no human opinion. No ground was left for the unspiritual. Therefore, the brothers and sisters must learn to live humbly before the Lord. The elders must be clear in their spirit. In this matter the leading brothers bear a heavy responsibility. If you are proud and self-assuming and do not learn your spiritual lessons properly, God&rsquo;s business will be destroyed by your hand. In this matter the responsible ones must learn. On the one hand, they have to receive much dealing and learn many lessons before the Lord. On the other hand, they have to follow the pattern of Acts 15. They have to learn to listen to the brothers and sisters, to touch the authority of the Holy Spirit, and to make decisions before God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL<br />AND THE GOSPEL OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Evening, March 2, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><p>Witness Lee: Individually or as the church, something is wrong when there is no fruit from our gospel preaching. Church history throughout the past two thousand years shows that as soon as an individual or a church touches God's grace, many people are saved. The church in Hong Kong must preach the gospel. Today we will speak about preaching the gospel. Concerning the preaching of the gospel we have to pay attention to two things. First, the church must have the spirit of the gospel. Second, the whole church must be active in preaching.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL</h2><h2 class="head2">The Power of the Gospel<br />Issuing from the Spirit of the Gospel</h2><p>If our preaching merely stirs up men's emotions or turns men to outward activities, this gospel will never be powerful. In order to preach the gospel we must have the spirit of the gospel. This is the only thing that will bring in the genuine power of the gospel. About three years ago I spoke on this subject at a university in Shanghai. I said that if a young person would open his spirit to the Lord, he would surely receive the spirit of the gospel from God. Today the church must preach the gospel. The church must love sinners' souls. This is especially true of the young students. If the Lord gives you a burden in your spirit, when you see your classmates playing in the field, you should kneel down and pray for them. If you do not preach the gospel, you will not feel happy. Individually or as the church of God, we must be filled with the spirit of the gospel. If both the individuals and the church are filled with this gospel spirit, sinners will be saved continually.</p><p>D. L. Moody led over one million people to the Lord on both sides of the Atlantic during his lifetime. He was a shoemaker, but because he had a love for sinners' souls, he forsook everything for the Lord's gospel. He was very burdened for man's soul. Once he invited a young girl to his Sunday school meeting. The girl promised to come but did not show up. A few days later, Moody met her on the street and ran after her. The girl ran into a hotel, closed the doors to one of the rooms, and hid under a bed. But Mr. Moody did not give up. He followed her into the hotel and dragged her out from under the bed. The girl could not do anything except go to the meeting with him. After Moody died, a co-worker, R. A. Torrey, was on a train. A lady asked him, "Do you know who I am?" He answered, "No." She said, "I am the daughter of the little girl who was pulled from under the bed to attend the Sunday school."</p><p>Another time, Mr. Moody went out in the rain with an umbrella that did not have a top. Many curious ones came around him. As the crowd gathered, he began to tell them that God's judgment would come, and nothing that they had would hide them from this judgment. They would all be like a topless umbrella; nothing would keep out the rain. Many people were saved through such a word.</p><p>Many people criticize those who are zealous for the gospel. They say that zealous ones are mentally unstable. These ones who criticize are afraid that they will also become "mentally unstable" if they become zealous for the gospel. Actually, those who are zealous for the gospel are not mentally unstable. They are pressed by a gospel spirit, and they feel uncomfortable and painful if they do not preach the gospel. When I was saved, I did not have any peace until I preached the gospel to others. Every holiday I would write some gospel tracts and go to the villages to preach the gospel from house to house. At other times, I would preach the gospel to whomever I met.</p><h2 class="head2">The Characteristic of Those Who Have<br />a Gospel Spirit</h2><h2 class="head3">Not Being Ashamed</h2><p>If we have a gospel spirit, the first thing we will have is "thick skin." This means that we are not ashamed. Not only is the spirit within us strong, but our skin is thick. This means we have no sense of self-consciousness or shame. Suppose our house was on fire. We would run to the street and shout. We would not be ashamed and would not be self-conscious. If we have a gospel spirit and see men walking away from salvation, how can we shut up and be ashamed of shouting when their soul is going to hell? We cannot be ashamed of the gospel. Whether or not others like to hear us, we have to preach. Church history shows that all those who are good at saving souls are "thick-skinned." They seem to be oblivious to everything. They are like fools to others. Those who are polite cannot save too many people, but those who have a strong gospel spirit and whose faces are thick will lead many to salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">Not Being Conscious of One's Own Status</h2><p>Those with a strong gospel spirit do not care too much about their own position or status. They can walk away from their own "throne." Some people are bank managers, college professors, gentlewomen, college students, and ladies, and their status is their throne. They are not willing to walk away from their throne to preach the gospel. But once the spirit of the gospel rises up in us, we will immediately forget about our status and position. We will forget about our throne and will care only to bring people to salvation. If we are beside ourselves for the Lord in this way, we will bring many to salvation. The kind of persons we are will be the kind of person we beget; it will determine the kind of person we bring to salvation. If we are lukewarm, those whom we bring to the Lord will also be lukewarm.</p><p>If we do not have these two traits, that is, if we will not give up our "face" and status, we will not have a strong gospel spirit. In order for us to have a gospel spirit, we must go to God and pray to Him to remove any hindrances. We must forget about our "face" and ignore our status and standing for the gospel's sake and for the sake of man's soul.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In order to be effective in preaching the gospel, we must do two things. First, we must have strong, thorough, and powerful prayer before preaching. We have to carry men's souls to God. Next, we have to invite people in. We must not only carry men's names to God but also bring them in to listen to the gospel. This is the reason we must prepare a list and write the names of all the people we know on the list. Those who live around us should be invited to listen to the gospel. Those who live elsewhere should receive the gospel through the mail. I have a somber feeling that the church in Hong Kong is very much behind in the gospel spirit, in the matter of gospel preaching. If fifty brothers and sisters have the gospel spirit, we will fill our meeting hall with two hundred to three hundred people the minute we call a gospel meeting. The effectiveness of the gospel is based on two things: much prayer and a serious effort to bring in our friends and relatives. Those whom we drag in from the street are not very reliable. Friends and relatives are different. They are related to us already, and it is easy to touch them.</p><h2 class="head1">VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS IN THE CHURCH<br />IN PREPARATION FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>When the church has a gospel move, everyone has to coordinate and work together as one man. If the gospel meeting is conducted in the meeting hall, all the brothers and sisters have to do their best to invite people to come.</p><h2 class="head2">Ushering</h2><p>Ushering is very important in a gospel meeting. In particular, there is the need of proper arrangements in ushering visitors to their seats. If a preacher sees something wrong in the way his audience is sitting, the power of his speaking will be reduced by one half, even if he is a very good speaker. A gospel friend feels uncomfortable when there is too little or too much ushering. Do not pass out tracts to the friends during the meeting. This will distract their heart and spirit. The ushering brothers and sisters must be sensitive but inconspicuous. They should let their presence be felt only when they are needed.</p><h2 class="head2">Sitting beside Friends</h2><p>We need to appoint brothers and sisters to sit by every gospel friend. They can help the friends to find the right hymn and the right verses. They can sing with them or read the verses with them. If necessary, they should say a few words softly to the friends or stand up with them to pray and to receive the Lord. However, those who are sitting among the visitors should not speak too much. They should not try to set up a little separate "platform" of their own. If we do not do anything, we do not realize the technique involved. Once we do something, we realize that nothing is easy. This is like trying to keep our white shirt clean. It does not become dirty if we do not wear it. Once we wear it, however, it is hard to keep it clean. There are many things we need to pay attention to in sitting with new ones. If we are not careful, they will not receive the necessary help.</p><h2 class="head2">Getting Their Names</h2><p>We need to pay attention to helping the new ones give us their names. In helping them to leave their names, we must not only get the names but also take care of their reaction. In talking to them, our attitude and tone have to be proper and natural. We should not interrogate them like a census taker. While our friends are listening to the gospel, we should pay attention to their response. If we observe that some are touched, we should help them receive the Lord in a proper way after the message. In filling out forms for our friends after the gospel meeting, we should not only write down objective facts but also their reaction to the gospel. In this way, others can render them the proper help.</p><p>When I was in Chefoo, we had a brother who worked in the customs department. After he was revived and touched by the Lord's love, he brought many of his colleagues to salvation, but his wife was against his faith in the Lord. Once, he invited a few brothers to his house for a meal and fellowship. His wife treated the brothers coldly and only served leftovers. In spite of this, he eventually brought his wife to salvation. He did it by first inducing his wife to come to a gospel meeting. While I was speaking, he noticed that his wife was listening attentively. She was touched but dared not stand up. No one was sitting beside her. The next day she came again. She was very touched by my word. Her face turned red and tense. I was secretly keeping an eye on her. At that critical time, no one dared speak to her. Eventually, the Lord worked in her in a mighty way, and she stood up and received the Lord. If someone had been there to help her, it would have been much easier for her to receive the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Following Up</h2><p>We should not invite people to come to a gospel meeting and then let them go away easily. After the meeting, we have to follow up with discussions with them. In a gospel meeting, the message is only fifty percent of the work. Another twenty-five percent of the work lies in sitting with the friends, making various arrangements, and helping them to write down their names. The last twenty-five percent of the work consists of our follow-up discussions with our friends. We are not here to be pew members, inquirers, or nominal Christians. Every one of us has to speak the mystery of the gospel. The fire of the gospel should be as fierce as possible. The hotter the fire, the easier it is for people to get saved. This is like the fire we use for cooking. The heat should be as high as possible. Otherwise, the food will not be cooked. The conclusion of a gospel meeting is the follow-up conversation. This is a work that the whole church should participate in.</p><h2 class="head2">Gospel Songs</h2><p>In congregational preaching, we need gospel songs. These gospel songs should be one-fourth of the content of a gospel meeting. I am an outsider as far as music is concerned, but I can make a few comments because I have learned some lessons these years in preaching the gospel.</p><p>The first thing to remember in singing gospel songs is to not emphasize the music too much. If we emphasize the music too much, we may lose the gospel spirit. The tune and the rhythm must be right, but the main emphasis should be the spirit. When we sing in private, we can take care of the music. But in leading others to sing in a gospel meeting, we must have spiritual inspiration. Music is the inspiration of the soul; it can only touch man's soul. If we want to touch man's spirit, we must have spiritual inspiration. In order to have spiritual inspiration, we must fellowship with the Lord and pray. This is the only way to have spiritual power. Suppose we are singing a song about sin. As we sing it, we must have a feeling for sin. Men's hearts must be pricked. The same can be said about songs on God's love. Others must genuinely touch God's love and be moved by it. Some people are fifty percent saved after they sing a song. If we sing properly, we can touch sinners easily. Another thing we should remember is that we should not try to put too much expression on our face when we sing. Everything should come spontaneously from the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Things to Consider with Children's Meetings</h2><p>Concerning children's meetings during the gospel meetings (i.e., child care), we have to pay attention to a few points. First, the content of the children's meeting must never be the same as the content of the gospel message. For example, the gospel message may be on vanity or the futility of work in salvation. We cannot speak this to the children, because such topics are unsuitable for their age.</p><p>We should tell the children Bible stories. Use Bible stories to show them the proper standard of human life. But we have to beware of two things. First, there is the possibility of premature spiritual knowledge. Second, we can give away biblical truths too cheaply. Some teachers are too spiritual. They tell children teachings that are too high and too spiritual. For example, they may teach the children to pray, "Help us, Lord, to deal with our flesh. May Your cross work on us." This gives the children premature spiritual knowledge. It will not help them. Other teachers treat spiritual things too lightly in an attempt to make the children understand. Their speaking does not do justice to the spiritual weight of their subject. This is also wrong. This gives away the truth too cheaply. We have to use the stories in the Bible to teach the children some lessons they can apply in their daily life. We have to teach them to live a normal human life. Of course, we cannot tell too many Bible stories. Otherwise, they will only go home with a bag of stories. Before children are old enough, we should never give them things that are too high or too spiritual for them.</p><p>The teachers of the children's meetings have to be very careful with their behavior and attitude. Their attire should be neat and simple. They should not wear flashy clothing, hair styles, or make-up. Teachers sometimes set improper examples for children, and this damages the children for their entire life. Frivolous words and jokes and improper conduct and gestures should be avoided. The teaching material is not that important by comparison. Teaching by example is more important than teaching by word of mouth. The brothers and sisters who act as teachers should be very careful and sober in their character and conduct.</p><p>The young ones should remember these words. They should do more and learn more. The young people should learn to work, but they should not overdo anything. They should learn to work in the proper amount. If they become too busy they will neglect the proper spiritual education.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Preach the Gospel<br />in All Kinds of Ways</h2><p>The above things require much training and practice. In preaching the gospel, we have to touch man's spirit. We have to use suitable words and deal with people in a suitable manner. We can ask some people to kneel down to pray, but we should allow others to sit down and pray. We should not do anything by force. With some people, we can encourage them to kneel down, and when they kneel down, they are saved. But others may react exactly the opposite. We must touch man's spirit, and we must touch the spirit that is present at the moment. Some people may tell us that they are ready to leave. But if we talk to them a little more and ask them to pray, they will be saved. In all these matters we need a sensitive spirit. We have to learn more and practice more. As we practice more, we will pick up an interest for this work. I do not know anything about fishing. Often I lose my bait and the fish get away. It is not enough to know how to place the bait. One has to know the disposition of the fish. The same can be said of preaching the gospel. We can push some people a little. With others, we have to go along with them a little. If we learn more and contact people more, we will discover the law to personal evangelism.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT TO DO AFTER THE GOSPEL MEETING</h2><h2 class="head2">Taking Down Their Names</h2><p>The end of the message is not the end of the story; there are still many things to do. The most important thing is to collect the names of all the gospel friends. These are our leads for future visitation. Other items need to be put back in order. The pens have to be gathered together in bags and placed in one place. The seats and the hall must be cleaned and properly rearranged.</p><h2 class="head2">Visitation</h2><p>After a man has heard the gospel, someone needs to visit him. The work of visitation should be done as soon as possible. The sooner we visit, the better the result. Appointment of visitation can be done in the districts. It is best to finish the arrangement by Sunday (i.e., the same day that the gospel is preached) and to visit them that same afternoon. On Monday evening the brothers and sisters can come together for fellowship. There are two kinds of visitations: one in which all the brothers and sisters participate, and a special kind of visitation that should be done by specific people assigned by the church.</p><h2 class="head1">GOSPEL TEAMS</h2><p>Not only must we invite people to come to the meeting hall to hear the gospel; we must organize gospel teams to bring the gospel to others. Indoor gospel preaching is for drawing people. Outdoor gospel teams are for bringing the gospel to people. The Lord commanded the disciples to "go therefore and disciple all the nations" (Matt. 28:19). The church in Hong Kong should organize gospel teams to go out to preach the gospel. This is not only good for exercising the gospel spirit; it will bring many to salvation who otherwise cannot come to us. In Taiwan a person about to board a train saw men running after the gospel teams. He was curious, and he ran with them. In the end he was saved. Seventy percent of the saved ones in Taipei are college students. Many are out-of-town students who have come to Taipei for their education. When we send the gospel teams to the streets, we can gain those who are away from home. If we only preach the gospel indoors, the number of people saved will be very limited.</p><p>In order to organize gospel teams, we need manpower and money. We need to have trumpets, accordions, drums, banners, armbands, and T-shirts for these teams. We also need some to play the instruments, beat the drums, and shout the slogans. Our gospel teams in Taipei are big in number. We have an inner circle of ushers and an outer circle of ushers. The inner circle of ushers is responsible for sitting down and talking to the friends. The outer circle of ushers is responsible for attracting people to come to listen. Some preach the gospel on the street corners. They kneel down with people and help them to pray and repent. This brings some to tears.</p><p>Outdoor gospel preaching can build up our gospel spirit. In Nanking, one brother was a carpenter. One day he put on a gospel T-shirt. On the front was the word sin, and on the back was the word death. He passed out tracts on the street and exhorted men to believe in the Lord. Others considered him odd, but he led people to kneel down and pray on the spot. He brought many to salvation this way.</p><h2 class="head1">PASSING OUT GOSPEL TRACTS</h2><p>In Hong Kong we should be passing out gospel tracts, putting up gospel banners, and making gospel billboards everywhere. If possible, we should install gospel neon signs. Today the businessmen put up advertisements everywhere. Their goal is to make money. If we Christians do not put up gospel advertisements, it is to our shame. The merchants advertise in order to make money. We advertise for the gospel in order to gain men's souls, that others may receive the benefit of the gospel freely (1 Cor. 9:23). History tells us that the newspaper was first used by Christians. But today Christians have abandoned it. This is a pity. I hope that some will receive a burden from the Lord to give themselves to the service of gospel advertisement.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL</h2><p>The schools and the occupations of all the brothers and sisters should be related to the gospel. It is difficult to bring the gospel to a campus from outside. But it is easy if some preach the gospel within the campus. In Taichung, Taiwan, one state-run agricultural school had only a few brothers and sisters. In less than half a year, the number increased to twenty or thirty people. Outwardly, the brothers and sisters were studying in that school. Actually, they were there for the gospel. Like Paul, we must be persons who are full of gospel germs (Acts 24:5; 26:29). The gospel has to spread out through us and infect others. The same can be said about our occupation. Those who hold some kind of occupation must be clear that their real occupation is the preaching of the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2><p>Watchman Nee: I have only a little to add to what was already said. Concerning all the services, the responsible brothers and sisters must start discussing, fellowshipping, and finalizing the steps to implement the various works.</p><p>The gospel work in the schools must not be done by one person on a campus alone. We should have at least two students on a campus.</p><p>The arrangement of the brothers' and sisters' occupations requires much fellowship. This is not a simple matter.</p><h2 class="head1">PRESENTING OUR ALL FOR THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In order to have the gospel spirit, not only must we offer up ourselves, but we need to accept the Lord's dealing. I can never forget what happened at 2:30 p.m. on February 13, 1922. Prior to that time I was seeking for the filling of the Holy Spirit. For a period of time I fasted and prayed in the park every Saturday in order that I would be equipped with the power of the gospel for preaching on Sunday morning. But the Lord was dealing with my entanglements. One day I yielded to the Lord's dealing. Brother Weigh knows that I cared very much for good clothing. I had a special fondness for silk gowns with red dots. But that day I took off my nice clothes, put on some old and simple clothes, went to the kitchen to prepare some paste, took a stack of gospel pamphlets, and pasted them on the walls of the streets. I also went around the city passing out gospel tracts. This was an unprecedented move in Foochow at that time. Because of this, many people were saved. In 1923, eleven of us young people organized ourselves into gospel teams. We put on gospel T-shirts with gospel slogans in front and behind and paraded through the city for the gospel. This became quite a sensation, and there was a revival in the city of Foochow.</p><p>The fire of the gospel should not go out in us. After a man is saved, the gospel fire begins to burn within him. But many people do not allow this fire to carry them on to spread the gospel. We all must repent for quenching the gospel fire in the past. We have pursued what we should not have pursued. We must not allow the Holy Spirit to be trapped and confined by us. What we have spoken of here is based on the gospel work that we have been doing for many years. It is based on our experience. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we would all rise up to preach the gospel and save sinners.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 3, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">ARRANGEMENT OF BUSINESS AFFAIRS&mdash;<br />TAKING CARE OF THE PROPER APPEARANCE<br />OF THE MEETING HALL</h2><p>Witness Lee: In the past we thought that appearance was not important. We thought that this was a minor matter that could be handled by some hired workers. We thought that we should reserve the saints' energy for spiritual work. But the more services there are in the church and the larger our meeting place is, the more pressing are these needs. Some people do not mind if our meeting hall is dirty or messy, but some people are naturally clean and tidy. They are used to cleanliness and feel uncomfortable when they come in. In large cities everyone pays much attention to modern amenities and hygiene. If a man comes into the meeting hall, and he finds the furnishings poor and dirty, it will be hard for him to be saved. Suppose there are specks and dirt on the chairs of the meeting hall. A person who comes to listen to the gospel must wipe it with a handkerchief before he can sit down. It would be hard for such a one to be saved. A messy hall can easily stumble others. A man once came to listen to the gospel in a white shirt. He was turned off from the gospel when the back of the chair soiled his shirt. The next day he came back to accuse the church and harass it. Although we do not want to be too fancy, modern, or extravagant, we should be proper, clean, and neat.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR SPIRITUAL FEELINGS<br />IN OUR ARRANGEMENTS</h2><p>In decorating the meeting hall, we must have spiritual feelings. Our feelings should not be superficial. We should do things out of a genuine love for the Lord. In our services we need thorough prayer. We do not determine the worth of a work by the work itself but by the person who is doing the work. Mopping the floor is a small thing, but if the president of the United States, Mr. Truman, or the queen of England came to No. 7 Jordan Road to mop, this would be a very significant event. Suppose a brother comes with a rag in his hand to clean the meeting hall. If his heart is for the Lord, he will pray as he cleans the windows. He will ask that the Lord bestow grace to the church through his labor. In this way his window cleaning becomes something weighty. If enough of the brothers' and sisters' love, prayer, and service are lavished on the meeting hall in this way, will not the Lord bless us? We have to remember the words of Song of Songs 2. The Lord Jesus is standing behind the wall. He is looking through the windows and through the lattice (v. 9). If the windows of the meeting hall are not clean and if the walls are dirty and greasy, I am afraid that the Lord cannot bless us.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters were saved because they were impressed by the cleanliness of the meeting hall. One brother was somewhat messy before he was saved. When he came to the meeting hall, the very sight of cleanliness and orderliness turned him to salvation. Another person did not believe in any so-called sacred sites. But as soon as he saw our meeting hall, he was subdued and believed. Two brothers were saved because they saw the meeting hall in their dreams. In 1942 they returned home from Shanghai. In their dreams they saw themselves walking into the meeting hall. When they woke up, they went to the meeting hall and saw that it was just as neat and tidy as they had seen in their dreams, and they were saved.</p><p>In decorating the meeting hall we must not only do a good job, but also we must lavish the saints' prayer, zealous spirits, and love on it. This is where we differ from the Gentiles.</p><h2 class="head1">INCITING A LOVE FOR SERVING THE LORD</h2><p>A meeting hall that is properly decorated will incite the brothers and sisters to love the Lord and to serve Him. The job itself may be very insignificant, but if it is done by us personally, we will take personal interest in it. If we encourage the brothers and sisters to clean the meeting hall themselves, we will incite in the saints a heart to love the Lord and to serve Him.</p><h2 class="head1">USING THE SERVICE<br />AS A MEANS FOR MUTUAL FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Serving in practical affairs is not merely for the purpose of getting jobs done. Through this service, the brothers and sisters find a chance to fellowship with one another. Suppose you are cleaning the floor. You can take the chance to fellowship with the other brothers and sisters. You can ask about their names, addresses, and conditions. You can talk about some of your spiritual experiences, such as confession, consecration, reading the Bible, and prayer. Floor cleaning is a small matter, but through spiritual fellowship, this cleaning becomes a great matter.</p><p>I hope we can all start our service with cleaning the floor. If we appoint others to clean the floor, we may worry that they will not want to do it. But if we take the lead to clean it first, no one can say anything. In our service we must always have spiritual feelings and spiritual fellowship. We must bring the brothers and sisters to climb higher in their practical service.</p><h2 class="head1">THINGS TO NOTE IN OUR DECORATION</h2><p>Purchasing: There is no need to keep a detailed account of consumable items. The tangible furniture and utensils, however, should be inventoried and registered in a book. Specific people should be assigned to manage and maintain these items. Every design and arrangement should be well rehearsed so that every brother and sister knows exactly what to do. The responsible ones have to take the lead and supervise the brothers and sisters to do the same. I like to see the brothers and sisters serving in the meeting hall.</p><p>Anything that has the shape of a dragon or is too cheap or frivolous should be discarded. Things that we have no use for should also be discarded. We should not only supervise the brothers and sisters but also should put our own hands to the work. In doing anything we have to be weighty; we should gain others' respect. If the sofa is old, we should consider getting a new one. Every item and every corner of the meeting hall have to be thoroughly revamped.</p><p>The decor of the meeting hall should fit various occasions. For example, weddings, love feasts, and gospel meetings should have different kinds of banners. We cannot take care of anything by chance. We should avoid last-minute decisions. There must be careful planning and scheduling.</p><p>It is inevitable that we may need last-minute arrangements sometimes. The best way to do anything is to plan ahead. If any crisis happens, we can call the brothers and sisters involved and make arrangements on the spot. The big jobs are hard, and it is not easy to neglect them. The small jobs are easy, and it is easy to neglect them. But we must neglect neither the big nor the small jobs.</p><p>Any Bible or hymnal that has missing pages should be discarded. Any copy that is torn should be mended. We do not want anyone to come into the meeting hall and leave with a bad impression. When the saints walk into the meeting hall, we want their heart, their entire being, their prayer, and their love to pour out freely in it.</p><h2 class="head1">USHERING IN THE MEETINGS</h2><p>Not everyone can be an usher. An usher must be sober in his private life. He must be blameless outside the church. Otherwise, when someone comes to the meeting and sees such a one as an usher, he may be stumbled. An usher must not be obsequious, but neither should he be impolite. He should learn to behave properly. In ushering one has to be gracious and warm. He should not be worldly but should give others the feeling of being spiritual and heavenly. An usher should not usher too much; he should not greet loudly and conspicuously. Instead, he should be hidden and appear only when needed. An usher must mark all the new faces and give them a feeling of warmth. We must also learn to greet Christians from other denominations. We should not let them feel that we are sectarian.</p><p>The above things seem superficial, but they are actually spiritual matters. We have to learn to match the outward condition of things with their inward spiritual condition. If we can do this, the Lord will greatly bless us and be gracious to us.</p><h2 class="head1">ADDITIONAL WORDS</h2><p>Watchman Nee: On the one hand, the church has to take care of the visitation work. This takes care of the aspect of fellowship. On the other hand, the church has to preach the gospel. This takes care of the unbelievers. We have to ask God to grant us the blessing of nourishing as well as the blessing of begetting.</p><p>The most basic work in the church is the meetings. If the number of believers increases, the number of meetings will increase correspondingly. If we have a big number and many meetings, yet do not know how to make all the practical arrangements, we cannot meet the need of the congregation. If the minor affairs are neglected, the spiritual things will be wasted. By taking care of minor affairs properly, we help the meetings indirectly. Eighty percent of the so-called minor affairs are related to our meetings. Therefore, our brothers and sisters must not neglect the minor affairs. For example, in order to deliver a message, there is the need of ushers. In order to preach the gospel, there is the need to sound the gong and to invite people in. Once they are in, we need ushers to lead them to their seats.</p><p>The deacons' office is mainly for business affairs. Practical affairs can be headed up by the deacons' office. The ministers who take care of the spiritual matters are responsible for the ministry of the word, while the deacons who take care of the practical matters are responsible for the decoration, design, and arrangements of the meeting hall. The apostles gave themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word while the practical affairs were assigned to the seven deacons (Acts 6:2-5). I hope that we will learn good lessons on the spiritual side as well as on the practical side.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">VISITATION AND FELLOWSHIP</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 4, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Brother Watchman Nee, Brother Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Acts 15:36</h1><h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Thank You Lord. You are the true vine, and we are the true branches of this true vine. We feel that we are not worthy to be joined to You, but thank and praise You that through Your redemption and the shedding of Your blood, we have been joined to You. Thank You! This is Your good will. Lord, lead us to learn to trust You, look up to You, and receive all the rich elements that come from this true vine. May we truly do nothing apart from this vine.</p><p>Lord, thank You for giving up Your most precious life. Today we can have You as our life. Thank You that during this past month You have supplied us with Your word and Your light and have enlightened us in the spiritual pathway through Your servants. Your grace has exceeded our prayer of a month ago. It has exceeded what we thought or hoped for. Indeed this is Your mercy. If it is according to Your will, may we continue to have times of peace together before You. Continue to speak clearer words to us. Grant our brothers stronger and richer words so that our consecration and service can be uplifted. Grant Your servants the light so that we can serve more absolutely. Although there were frustrations from Satan in the past, some of these frustrations are over. How we thank and praise You. You have destroyed all the works of Satan. We join You to oppose all the works of Satan. Thank and praise You! Satan cannot stop us from serving You. He cannot stop us from coming to You to receive grace. Grant us more of Your mercy and grace today. Your servant prays this in the name of Christ Jesus. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF VISITATION</h2><h2 class="head2">First Fellowshipping with the Lord</h2><p>Witness Lee: Visitation is a most spiritual work. It is more spiritual than preaching the gospel, serving in the deacon's office, or various preparation works. Visitation is a kind of fellowship; it is a kind of fellowship with the saints in the divine fellowship we have with the Lord. In visiting others, if we do not have fellowship with the Lord, it will be difficult to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters. In order to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters we visit, we first must establish fellowship with the Lord in our spirit. We fellowship with the brothers and sisters with our outer man, but our inner man remains in fellowship with the Lord. Through this fellowship we bring the ones we visit to the Lord in a good way. Hence, those who visit must live in the presence of the Lord themselves.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Definite and Practical Training</h2><p>Next, we need definite and practical training. For example, we have to learn what it means to have a thorough confession. If we have never learned to make a thorough confession, we will not be able to help others have this experience. We may not be lacking in other areas, but as long as we do not have a thorough confession, there is still a lack in us. If we have never thoroughly confessed our sins before the Lord, we cannot help the brothers and sisters whom we visit to experience this in a thorough and definite way. It is only as we have learned this in a definite way that we can render definite help to others. Suppose our English is very good. If we want to test another person's English, we only need to ask him some questions and speak a little in English. Then we will know his ability. But it is only after we have learned English properly that we can test others' standards and identify their problems. In the same way we need a thorough training in spiritual things before we can render help to others. Consider the matter of consecration. If we have a thorough consecration again and again, when we fellowship with others, we will know how strong their consecration is. The same is true with spiritual feelings, the renewing of the understanding, etc. In all these areas first we must learn spiritual experiences in a definite and practical way. Then when we visit the brothers and sisters we can render suitable help to them.</p><p>In Taipei, every Monday beginning at 8:30, I spend the whole morning with the serving brothers and sisters to discuss their visitation work. They present the results of their fellowship. I ask them how they feel about the ones they have visited. Many answer, "Not bad," "Very good," or "Not too good." I pursue the matter by asking, "What do you mean by `not bad'? What do you mean by `very good'? What do you mean by `not too good'? What is `not bad,' what is `very good,' and what is `not too good'?" If a person is zealous, comes to the meetings, prays, and reads the Bible, it does not necessarily mean that he is very good. We have to point out definitely in what way he is good or in what way he is not good. For example, in the matter of reading the Bible, we have to find out the way he reads. Many people have read Genesis. Others have read Romans 6&mdash;8 many times. But they skip over 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, or the genealogy in Matthew 1:1-18. These are sloppy Christians. In visiting the brothers and sisters, we should not only look at their outward condition. We have to touch their real inward, spiritual condition. In order to do that, we must have spiritual learning and acquire spiritual reality first.</p><p>If we truly have had some spiritual experiences and learned some spiritual lessons through pain and sacrifice, we will not easily and carelessly tell others about these lessons. If we practice these things in a definite way, when we visit others we will not speak about prayer, confession, Bible reading, or consecration in a general way without at the same time giving them definite steps to practice. Of course, we have to pay a price for every spiritual lesson. But at the same time we have to learn to receive a supply from one another mutually. For this reason all the brothers and sisters should come together at least once a week. In addition to fellowshipping about the condition of the ones visited, they should also fellowship about various spiritual lessons. They should not allow anything to slip by easily. Everyone should say something definite. He must point out in which area a person is "not too good" and in which area he is "quite good." Everyone should fellowship about the condition of the saints in a definite way. Everyone should present the problems he faces and ask for opinions from the others. If a local church cannot solve a problem, it can write to elderly brothers and sisters in another locality or to another church to ask for help. We can see that this kind of visitation is very demanding. This is the reason I say that we learn the most spiritual lessons through visitation.</p><h2 class="head1">THINGS TO TAKE CARE OF IN OUR VISITATION</h2><p>The brothers and sisters should take care of a few things in their visitation.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Having the Thought of Going to Teach Others</h2><p>First, in visiting others we should not have the thought that we are going to teach. We should not think that we know more than others. A teaching spirit is a proud spirit. It will only debilitate others' spirits; it will not edify and supply others. Isaiah 50 says we must have a tongue of a learner before we can strengthen the weak with our words (v. 4). We must learn to listen, to fellowship with the Lord in our spirit, and to look to Him for light before we can help others with a suitable word.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Words Must Be Accurate and Full of Supply</h2><p>In visiting others we have to be careful with our words. Our words must be accurate. Many words should be held back, and we should not speak them easily. Often our words are inaccurate because our tongue is untamed. Many of us think that we are only wild in our thinking. Actually, we are wild in our speaking as well. If we apply ourselves to learn this lesson, we will discover that the tongue is just as difficult to bridle as the mind. In 1935 God asked me to do something. He wanted me to learn to be accurate in my speaking. At that time I felt this was very difficult. Within one day I would apologize to others many times. Once my child was filling a tub with water. About eight to ten drops of water spilled onto the floor because his hands were shaking. When I saw this I rebuked him, saying, "How can you wet the whole floor?" After I said this something within me said, "Not even half of the floor is wet. How can you say that he has wet the whole floor?" I had to apologize to my son.</p><p>Many times the Holy Spirit is released through our speaking. But many times death is also released through our speaking. Therefore, never talk about things related to church service when visiting others. If others ask us about a certain elder, we should not answer him directly. Many times such discussions turn into gossip, criticism, and complaints. The result is death. We should learn to be accurate in the words we use in our fellowship. We should only speak words that supply life and should not touch gossip, criticism, and condemnation.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Raising Arguments</h2><p>In visiting the brothers and sisters, we must be careful to not raise any arguments. If brothers and sisters have questions regarding the church, individuals, the truth, or the work, we should not argue with them at all. We visit them because we care for them. We are not there to discuss what is right and what is wrong. If arguments occur in our visitation, it is to no one's benefit. Such arguments will only bring both parties into the darkness of the mind. Therefore, in visiting others, we should avoid arguments. If our spirit is strong enough we will do our best to lead people to touch God in their spirit. In this way, we will avoid many negative problems.</p><h2 class="head1">ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING VISITATION<br />FOR SHEPHERDING</h2><p>The assignment of visitation should be based on the name lists which are distributed to the various districts. Our visitation should pay much attention to the care of the new ones and to conducting make-up lessons for them. The assignment of visitation in the various districts should be open to changes. If the number of those engaged in visitation in a district is not enough, the church should assign saints from other districts to come to the aid of this district. Church visitation is for making up the lack in district visitations. There are a few kinds of visitations which can come under the description of church visitations.</p><h2 class="head2">Special Visitations</h2><p>Visitation for special occasions includes many things, such as funerals, marriages, moving, changing jobs, starting new jobs, unemployment, sickness, etc. Anything that a man encounters which causes a change in the environment can be considered a special occasion. The most dangerous period that a man faces is in the transitional time when he experiences a change in his environment. The church has to strengthen such a one with visitations. Everyone moving to Hong Kong as well as every visitor should receive proper hospitality. The church has to pay attention to all the needs that accompany changes in the brothers and sisters. If the church can cover this kind of visitation work, it will be strong. But if it does not do anything, nothing will happen.</p><h2 class="head2">Hospitality</h2><p>Hospitality can be considered a kind of visitation and shepherding. The church has to continue in this work patiently. It should not only arrange transportation for the visiting brothers and sisters but should provide hospitality for them as well. Ten years ago in Manchuria, the rural churches were very good at hospitality. They might not have known you, but as long as you were a brother or a sister, they would receive you freely. The church in Shanghai is not that attentive to the needs of the brothers and sisters from North China and Manchuria. But the Manchurian brothers and sisters are all very hospitable. People dwelling in big cities generally have less of a heart for hospitality. The church in Hong Kong may have the heart, but it may also have obstacles. The Bible is full of records of hospitality. We have to be zealous in this work. If a Christian does not open his home for visitors, he is either short of love or has problems with his family. Giving hospitality brings light into our homes. If there is nothing wrong with our homes, why should we be afraid of light? If we say that our home is too modest, this is understandable; the church can then pick up the burden of hospitality. But church hospitality is like hospitality in a hotel; it does not have the same taste as staying in a home. It does not give others the taste of Christ's love and the blessing of heaven. If possible, we should even practice foot-washing. Suppose a worldly brother comes to Hong Kong and a family receives him. If this family is led by the Lord to wash his feet, I believe not only will his feet be washed, but his whole being will be washed as well. But the prerequisite to all this is a mutual love one for another. Today when we call each other brothers and sisters, we do not have the same feeling as the first church. Perhaps the underlying reason for this absence of feeling is our lack in hospitality. Church hospitality must be handled properly. On the one hand, this will help our guests to love the Lord. On the other hand, this will keep us from being drawn away to the world by our friends and relatives.</p><p>One basic hidden work we have to do in the gospel propagation is the receiving of out-of-town visitors. In 1934 a sister's husband and son returned from overseas. Neither of them were saved. The way they were sent away by the church touched the husband, and the way they were received by the church touched the son. In the end both were saved. Some brothers and sisters have been saved through hospitality. Hence, the church has to be diligent to practice this.</p><h2 class="head2">Visitation by Correspondence</h2><p>The third kind of visitation is visitation by correspondence. When brothers and sisters go abroad or move to another locality, the church must not only write a letter of recommendation for them and inform the destination churches about them, but the church must appoint some saints to correspond with them. In particular, those who send them off should also be responsible for corresponding with them. Their responsibility in this matter remains and continues until such saints have established fellowship with the destination churches and are fully settled down. If a brother or sister goes to a place that does not have a church, others should communicate with him and bring the church to him, thus taking care of his spiritual condition before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Love Feasts</h2><p>The fourth kind of visitation and care is love feasts. It is scriptural for believers to come together often to eat. When they come together to eat, it is easy for their hearts to be kindled and for their spirit to mingle together in fellowship. In Acts 2, at the beginning of the church life, the believers came together often to eat. Eighteen years ago in North China, I experienced this all the time. When the brothers and sisters come together in joy and bask in mutual fellowship, much profit and blessing follow. Therefore, I encourage the brothers and sisters to have love feasts all the time.</p><p>The elders and the responsible brothers should urge the saints to have love feasts all the time. We have to ask them, "Have you made arrangements for a love feast today?" If they have not, we have to ask if they have a desire to hold such a feast. If they have such a desire, we have to ask them when they will have it. If they have not set a date, we have to ask approximately when they will have it. If they say they will have it in a few days, we have to ask if they can have it the following day. If they say yes, we have to ask whom they will invite. They may say that they want to invite certain familiar ones or certain brothers and sisters. If we feel that this is not wise, we should suggest a few other brothers. In this way, we will help the brothers and sisters know each other and provide them more opportunities for fellowship.</p><p>Suppose eighty people come to a gospel meeting and are baptized. If many brothers and sisters voluntarily invite these baptized ones for a love feast, and if each baptized one has five or six people joining him for a love feast, I believe the invited ones will have no choice but to love the Lord, come to the meetings, and remain. The brothers and sisters have to look for and create opportunities for love feasts. They can set up appointments after the Lord's Day meeting. During the week they should prepare extra seats at home. If our home is open all the time for love feasts with the brothers and sisters, it will be easy for our family members to become saved. Of course, it is not enough for the responsible ones to promote this; they must practice it themselves.</p><p>In the church in Taipei, we have pre-printed invitation cards for inviting people to love feasts. If necessary, we can ask the deacons' office to take the initiative to make arrangements to have love feasts in various saints' homes. In this way the brothers and sisters can get to know each other, pray, testify, and fellowship during their meal. It is more casual and intimate to eat at home than at restaurants. During the love feasts, we can ask the brothers and sisters to give their testimonies. Some may say, "I am very happy to be invited by our host to this dinner. Since he wants me to say something, I guess I have to say something." Some may say, "Tonight I am very grateful for your love. I highly treasure your warmth and sincerity in inviting me here. It is not right for me to be on the receiving end all the time; I feel that I have to give a testimony." Others may say, "I came from a small place, and I am not used to such large gatherings. Please bear with me if my fellowship is not too good." Whatever the guests say, their hearts will be warmed up and everyone will be refreshed.</p><p>Our love feasts should take care of nutrition, not extravagance. If we are too extravagant, we cannot have such feasts often, and some may be too intimidated to come. If our love feast is too sumptuous and extravagant, others will not dare to do the same, and they will be discouraged from coming. Try as much as possible to not spend too much money on love feasts. If we can save a little, we can offer up what we have saved for greater needs elsewhere. We should restrict our spending in everything and should save our money for more important needs in the church. We should not live one day in ease and comfort. We should save as much as we can for the gospel's sake. We have to conduct love feasts frequently and make this our habit. But we should only serve ordinary food; there should not be any excess. Since we need to eat three times a day, we might as well eat in each others' homes.</p><p>The best kinds of people to invite to a love feast are gospel friends and saints whom we are unfamiliar with. If brothers and sisters invite the same familiar ones to the same houses day after day, the money spent on these love feasts will be wasted on each other. In reality this money belongs to the Lord. We must invite those brothers and sisters whom we do not know more frequently. Such love feasts are worthwhile. A love feast that is filled with love will incite us to love even more. If the brothers and sisters prepare such love feasts all the time, more testimonies will come out of the saints when the church comes together for fellowship, and they will render more praises and thanksgiving in their remembrance of the Lord and their worship of the Father. Those brothers and sisters who are responsible for the love feasts must remember to remind the saints of this practice.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP IN THE HOMES</h2><p>The responsible brothers and sisters have to learn to have the heart of a nursing mother. We know that women who have children of their own are more enlarged in their heart; they have a greater capacity for love. We have to ask God to increase our capacity for love toward others. The young brothers and sisters should learn not only to fellowship with their parents, but also with other parents. They should also learn to open themselves to the responsible brothers and sisters. The church should have the atmosphere of a home, and the brothers and sisters should be as free to fellowship as at home.</p><h2 class="head1">VISITATION BEING THE SUPPLY LINE TO THE CHURCH</h2><p>Watchman Nee: The church is like an army; it must have the proper supply line. Without the supply line, it will be defeated easily. The supply line of the church is its visitation work. When all the saints are involved in visitation, it is a mark that the whole church is mobilized in the gospel work. In order to preach the gospel in a prevailing way, the word must go out in many ways. Today new businesses come up with all kinds of ways to promote their products. This is their declared goal. As long as they can promote their product, they will use any way. The gospel is our product, and the sinners are our customers. We cannot work as we did before, limiting ourselves to just one method&mdash;podium preaching. Today we need to preach the gospel by every means. No matter where we are and what method we use, our goal is to save more men. We do not necessarily have to use the same method all the time. This is what it means by total mobilization for the gospel work.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH<br />BEING A MATTER OF THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><p>Today the church is taking the way of recovery. We cannot remain sixteenth-century Christians today. It is not enough to be a Christian of Luther's time. We have to return to the nascent condition at Pentecost. At Pentecost church service was a matter of all the one-talented ones rising up. It was the service of the whole Body. In Luke the Lord said that we have to invite people, even if by force, to come to the gospel feast. Men have to come in order to receive salvation, and for this there is the need for some to go to the streets and lanes of the city and to compel the poor, crippled, blind, and lame to come in (Luke 14:16-24). Once they come in, they are saved. The more the servants go out to invite and compel others to come, the more men will be saved.</p><p>Why must there be so much fellowship and visitation in the church? The fellowship and visitation that the church practices today is a kind of basic training; it prepares and equips all the brothers and sisters for service. The fifty-two Messages for Building Up New Believers are the basic course work. These lessons cover basic Christian practices; they provide a kind of basic training for the believers. As long as we are saved, we have one talent, and we need to be trained. The verdict has been passed: We all have one talent. The conclusion is drawn: We are all useful. All the brothers and sisters have to accept our arrangements. No one can bury his one talent in the ground.</p><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEW BELIEVERS' MEETING</h2><p>To a nearsighted person, it makes a great difference whether or not he has glasses on; it determines whether or not he sees. The new believers' meeting is as important to us as glasses are to a nearsighted person. Topics such as prayer, reading the Bible, and rising early have much to do with the building up of our Christian character. Before my heart became weak, I used to rise up before 5:30 every morning. Sometimes when I rose up a little late, I would punish myself the next day by waking up earlier. We cannot be loose with ourselves. If we are loose, it will be hard for us to teach others or to train them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MORE ADVANCED ONES<br />TEACHING THE MORE RECENT NEWCOMERS</h2><p>We cannot advance to new lessons unless we have first finished the fifty-two Messages for Building Up New Believers. For this reason we have to learn every one of these lessons thoroughly. Then we can help the newly saved ones pass on the same teachings to the next generation. This does not mean that we have to know all fifty-two lessons and learn them all by heart within a year before we can graduate and teach others. As long as we have learned something in the last month, we can use the same material to teach the new ones this month. This is like a provisional makeshift military school where the more advanced students serve as teachers to the newcomers. When I was young I studied at Trinity College. For a while I substituted for the teacher. I could teach, but this does not mean that I could sit down and teach as a teacher. When I spoke to the class, I dared not sit like the teacher; I had to stand while I spoke. Those who have learned a new believers' lesson last month can teach the new ones who show up the next month. But they can only teach as one student teaching another student; they cannot assume the role of a teacher. All waves eventually are caught up by the waves behind them. The latter glory is always greater than the former glory. The last shall be the first (Matt. 19:30). However, if the first group does not set a good standard, the ones who follow will not be able to go on in a proper way. We have to follow the way of the army in our training; we have to raise up our own teachers and then assign them to teach. We have to make up the lessons ourselves first and then help others make them up.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF OUR LANGUAGE</h2><p>The hidden reef in our visitation and fellowship is our mouth. James said that we bless the Lord and Father with our mouth and also curse men who have been made according to the likeness of God with our mouth (3:9). Satan has his way of dealing with the world. To him, there is not enough sin in the world; there is not enough to meet his need. He wants more sins. To him, murder, theft, idolatry, etc. are not enough. This is why he creates lies to increase the sins of this world. He thinks that the sins in conduct are too few in this world, and he stirs up man's mouth to multiply sin. Of all the transgressions in this world, sins in action occupy less than one-quarter; the others are sins in words. These are produced by Satan through man's mouth when many things are said and many lies and rumors spread.</p><p>Satan multiplies the sins of this world through man's mouth. When lies multiply, sins multiply. Satan was a liar from the beginning, and he is the father of liars (John 8:44). Who are the liars? Everyone who lies is a follower of Satan. James said that the tongue is a fire that is set on fire by Gehenna; it is the very world of unrighteousness (3:6). Man's mouth can create all the sins of this world. Many people like to speak, and they like to speak inaccurate words, evil words, and idle words. These ones are helping Satan multiply sin in this world; they are followers of Satan's way.</p><p>If our mouth is clean today, Satan can do nothing in this world. If sin decreases, Satan will be out of a job; he will be unemployed. In Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus said that our words should be yes, yes, and no, no. Anything more than this is of Satan (v. 37). We should not have any gossip, rumors, or idle talk in our family. In our fellowship with the brothers and sisters, we should only speak spiritual words and words of building; we should not help Satan multiply sin with our mouth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(9)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 6, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">THE DEACONS<br />AND THE DEACONS' OFFICE</h2><p>Witness Lee: We need to make some arrangements concerning deacons and the deacons' office. First, we need to make some arrangements about the work of the deacons' office. There are two kinds of people serving in the deacons' office. The first is the person on duty. The fourteen deacons should take turns in this duty. The second is assistants. These are responsible for clerical work.</p><p>There are two requirements for the deacons. First, they must not be afraid of trouble. They should welcome trouble. They are like the businessmen who are not afraid of more customers and more troubles. The deacons must be right in their motives. Some deacons are not right in their motives. When things get complicated and work gets busy, they have a wrong attitude. Second, the deacons cannot do things according to their own ways. They have to work according to the direction of the responsible brothers. If you are a housewife in a family, you are the only person taking care of the work in the house. There is no change of personnel. As such, you can do things absolutely according to your own will. But the work in the church deacons' office is different. You are not the master. If you cannot get through with something, you cannot change it at will. You can fellowship with the responsible ones of the deacons' office, but you cannot change it suddenly.</p><p>The work in the deacons' office must be based on rules and procedures. It should not depend on the whims of individuals. Except for special assignments, everyone should serve according to prearranged instructions. Everything has to be kept in the right place. This will make it easy for the next person to continue with the work.</p><p>A deacon has to be aware of everything around him when he serves in the deacons' office. If a brother or sister comes to you and asks a question, as a serving one on duty you cannot say that you do not know. Even if the brother asks you for a nail, you have to find it immediately, wherever it may be. For every question there may be fifty related questions, and you have to learn them all one by one. In this way you will be clear about everything, and you can answer any question.</p><p>The assistants in the deacons' office must obey the one who is on duty. In the church fellowship meeting, the elders have to explain the relationship of the brothers and sisters to the deacons' office. They should encourage the brothers and sisters to fellowship with the serving ones in the deacons' office. The deacons' office is not under the deacons, but under the elders. Hence, the elders must know everything that is occurring in the deacons' office. They must make sure that all the items of service are taken care of properly. They should not take care of them in the way of control, but in the way of assignment; they should assign the work to the deacons. If they find any preassigned arrangement in the deacons' office improperly done, they should not try to change it right away. Instead, they should inform the responsible ones of the deacons' office and make the changes in fellowship. In principle, if anyone makes a mistake in the deacons' office, the elders cannot make the adjustments themselves; they have to ask those who committed the mistake to adjust it.</p><p>In the fellowship meeting, the elders have to let the brothers and sisters know that the serving ones on duty in the deacons' office are serving on behalf of the church. All the brothers and sisters have to respect these ones. They have to learn to go along absolutely with the arrangements in the deacons' office. When an assignment comes to you from the deacons' office, you have to accept it mechanically; it is not a matter of seeking for leading. You only need to move according to instruction. The serving ones on duty should also occupy themselves with some extra work at ordinary times; they should not be idle in any way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE DEACONS' OFFICE<br />BEING A BIBLICAL ONE</h2><p>Watchman Nee: First we need to ask if this kind of arrangement is scriptural. Brother Ma, Brother Chia, are we scriptural? All those who know the Bible admit that this arrangement is according to the Lord's word. Acts 2:45 says that properties and possessions in the early church were "divided..to all, as anyone had need." In order to divide to all according to need, there first had to be a survey and a census of all the people. Only then could everyone's need be ascertained. Today it is a simple thing to read these few words. But there were tens of thousands of believers in the church in Jerusalem at that time. How much arrangement and preparation work was needed to divide to all according their need? Acts 6:1 tells us that trouble arose because of the neglect of the supply of a few widows. The church has to take care of many affairs. For this reason, there must be planning and arrangement.</p><p>The Bible only gives us general principles for handling these affairs; it does not give us a detailed record. This is because things differ with age and background. God does not want us to pay attention to the arrangement of practical affairs, but to men's spirituality. God recognizes the need for arrangement, but He does not think that it is so important that all the details need to be recorded in the Bible. He wants us to live before Him and receive His revelation and wisdom. If a man is filled with the Holy Spirit, he will spontaneously know how to deal with spiritual things. In 1 Timothy 5:9 we are told that the widows had to be enrolled in a register. That is the only reference to this matter. We only know that the widows were enrolled. As to what a register looks like, we have to go to the Lord and pray for wisdom and revelation. God will not show us the description of the register in detail. If He did, it would be easy for us to carry out things, and we would not need to pray.</p><p>In feeding the multitude the Lord told the disciples to arrange the crowd in groups of fifties and hundreds (Mark 6:39-40). The disciples learned from this. At Pentecost they were able to baptize three thousand and then five thousand, and then they were able to divide to all according to their needs. The Lord trained the disciples personally; He did not write a manual of instructions for the disciples to follow. In writing the Bible, the apostles were detailed in describing spiritual things. As far as the arrangement of practical affairs was concerned, however, they only told us that there were such arrangements. They did not tell us how these arrangements were made. Paul wrote fourteen Epistles, but he did not write a single church manual.</p><p>In keeping a record of the saints, it is wrong to say that we need one book, and it is equally wrong to say that we need many books. We only know that there is a principle of enrolling. As to how to enroll, we have to seek the Lord. We must not make decisions based on dead methods. We need a register because human memory is unreliable. Paul knew that he would die; therefore, there was the need of a register. But the Holy Spirit has not left the church. He is still leading the church on in practical matters. We have to know of the need for a register, but we have to look to the leading of the Holy Spirit in preparing this register. We need the Holy Spirit to give us the wisdom.</p><p>Arrangements in the church are different from those in denominational organizations or in business institutions. They must be based on spiritual principles. Everything we do must be biblical; we should not go to the extreme in anything. Here we are not emphasizing a method of doing things, but a principle of doing them. Even after we have a principle, we should still seek the leading of the Holy Spirit according to these principles.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF ARRANGING PRACTICAL AFFAIRS</h2><p>Today our arrangement of various practical affairs is for the purpose of training brothers and sisters to walk in an orderly and sober manner. The church is an institution, a Body in action. It should absorb as many people as are presented to it, whether one hundred or one thousand. In order to take care of all kinds of people, there is the need for suitable arrangements. We have to have the capacity to absorb every person. If there are no arrangements in the church, there will be confusion when the number increases. However, arrangement is not our goal. It is merely for the purpose of placing brothers and sisters in the right position of service so that the entire church can rise up to serve. The combined effect of the work of the deacons' office and of the various preparation works is like the logistic support of an army. When the whole church becomes the supply line, the power of the church will multiply. We have not set up five or six items of service randomly; they have a purpose. Through such arrangements the whole Body can serve and preach the gospel, and God can begin His recovery work on earth. By making these arrangements, we are making a way for the whole Body to rise up to serve.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW THINGS THE DEACONS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF</h2><p>I must speak in particular to the deacons. You should not try to assume leadership in the church. You should only work as you are told. Whether or not the church service is pleasing to God depends not so much on the performance of your work as on your obedience. In the church we must have love, and we must have authority. May the Lord bless the church in Hong Kong and grant all of us grace to learn submission. May we all learn the spiritual principles so that the entire Body will learn to serve in coordination.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE QUALITY OF THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 8, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Scripture Reading:Luke 9:51-56</h1><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S FACE TOWARDS JERUSALEM</h2><p>Today we will consider the subject of the quality of the spirit. A few days ago we spoke of the need to check our life, walk, and service, and consider whether or not the spirit was present in these activities and whether we sensed any spiritual feeling in doing these things. Today I will say that in addition to paying attention to having the spirit, we have to pay attention to the quality of our spirit. Luke 9:51-56 speaks of the quality of the spirit. The Lord shows us the kind of spirit the two disciples had. We can draw a precious lesson from this.</p><p>In Luke 9:28-36 the Lord was transfigured on the Mount of Transfiguration. Moses and Elijah were conversing with Jesus about the things that were to come to pass after His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem. God had foreordained that Christ would go to Jerusalem to accomplish the work of redemption. The Lord's pathway was set on the Mount of Transfiguration. Now He embarked on His way. This is the reason He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem. Between the Mount of Transfiguration and Jerusalem there were many stations. The Lord and His disciples had to pass through Samaria and through the city of Jericho. When He was about to enter a village of Samaria, He sent messengers to arrange for lodging. The Samaritans had never liked Jerusalem; they were always against the Jews. When they learned that Christ and His disciples were going to Jerusalem, they refused to receive them. They did not want Jesus' and His disciples' business. During my stay in London, I was returning from Southampton one night, and it was dark. I wanted to find a hotel for the night. I had to go to a few hotels before I found one that would take me, because I am Chinese. When I was in Chicago during the International Exhibition, I went to eight hotels. All of them told me they did not want my business. It may be a common thing to be refused because of being Chinese, but the Lord and His disciples were going to Jerusalem for the gospel and for the crucifixion. This was a great matter. Yet the Samaritans would not receive them. It was a tremendous thing for the Lord to go to Jerusalem. He was going there to accomplish redemption for all men. After His resurrection, the Lord told the disciples to spread the gospel from Jerusalem through Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. Yet they were rejected in Samaria.</p><p>Our Lord was meek. When the Samaritans rejected Him, He turned away. The Lord could take this, but the disciples could not. James and John even had the Scriptures to back up their indignation. They respected the Scriptures very much, and they referred to a story in the Scriptures and wanted to resort to a scriptural method to deal with the matter. They thought they would act as Elijah did in 2 Kings 1:1-12, calling fire down from heaven to consume the Samaritans. They thought that here was a man much greater than Elijah. How dare the Samaritans refuse the Lord! James and John asked the Lord if they could perform a sign to show that He was the Christ appointed by God. They had a basis for their indignation; they were not acting blindly.</p><p>But the Lord turned around and rebuked the two disciples. He did not rebuke them because they were scriptural or zealous. He rebuked them for their wrong spirit. A man can love the Lord, walk according to the Bible, and be zealous; he can act according to the teaching and ways of the Old Testament prophets and still be wrong in his spirit. There was nothing wrong with James's and John's love and zeal for the Lord. But their spirit was wrong. The Lord had to rebuke them. They were zealous, and they loved the Lord, but their spirit was wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A RIGHT SPIRIT TO SERVE THE LORD</h2><p>Here we face a problem: What kind of spirit is a right spirit? What kind of spirit is a wrong spirit? The above passage tells us that it is not enough to serve the Lord, love Him, and be zealous for Him. We have to know how our spirit is. We have to realize that a man is disapproved not because his conduct is wrong but because his spirit is wrong. The disciples were right in their zeal and love for the Lord; they were very scriptural, but because their spirit was wrong, everything was wrong. Man approves others based on conduct. But if a Christian approves others based on conduct, he has lowered the standard of spiritual things to its very lowest point. With many people the controversy is conduct, but the Lord looks at a man's spirit. The disciples might have been zealous for the Lord, but they were rebuked because their spirit was wrong. The Lord pays attention to our spirit. Man pays attention to conduct, Bible knowledge, zeal, and love, but the standard of the Christian life is based on the spirit, not on these things. The issue is the spirit, not events and work. Many young people argue about events and work. But the Lord's eyes are not on these things.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO THE RIGHTNESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that they did not know their spirit. Here we see a strange thing. James and John were speaking. They were asking on behalf of the Lord for God to send fire from heaven. The Lord did not rebuke them for saying the wrong words. He only rebuked them for having a wrong spirit. Among the saints, the most frequent controversy we hear is whose words are right and whose words are wrong. But I never argue about these things. Many times the brothers and sisters hear me say, "Your words are right, but your spirit is wrong." The Lord was not concerned about the rightness of the disciples' words. Behind the words, however, was the expression of the spirit. Was the spirit right? Whether or not our words are right is a separate issue. Our spirit comes out as soon as we open our mouth. The spirit that comes out of us may be a right spirit or it may be a wrong spirit. We should not emphasize merely the rightness of our words, but should consider the spirit as well.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>The Lord's words show us that a man can have a wrong spirit yet be completely ignorant of it. A man may be completely ignorant of himself. James and John trusted in themselves too much. They wanted to repeat what Elijah had done. They did not realize that their spirit was wrong. It is not surprising for a person to have a wrong spirit, but it is a strange thing for a man to have a wrong spirit yet not know about it. It is easy to recover a person who has erred in his spirit, but it is hard to recover one who does not know that he has erred in his spirit. The most horrible thing is not to sin but to sin and be ignorant of it, thinking all the while that you are doing good. It is hard to awaken those who are in darkness. A child may have a black face without knowing anything about it. When he comes into a room and others laugh at him, he may think that others like him. I tremble for those who have a wrong spirit but do not know about it. The trouble is not the mistake itself, but the absence of revelation and light. The words a man speaks tell us the kind of spirit he has. But often a man does not know what kind of spirit he has. Solomon said no one knows his own heart. Only foolish ones say that they know their own heart (Prov. 28:26).</p><p>A man cannot say that he does not have a spirit just because he does not know that he has a spirit. In the same way, a man cannot say that there is nothing wrong with his spirit just because he does not know that his spirit is wrong. If a man's spirit is wrong, it is wrong. When he speaks, his spirit is exposed. The disciples volunteered to vindicate the Lord. But the Lord's word shows us that they did not know their spirit, they did not know themselves, and they did not know that their spirit was in their speaking. When we speak, we may not know our spirit, and we may not know that our spirit is wrong. But those who listen know immediately that our spirit is wrong. The experienced ones who stand next to us know immediately. A man's word can be very scriptural. He can be zealous for the Lord, but if he does not have a right spirit, those who are in fellowship with the Lord will know immediately. I hope our brothers and sisters will learn before the Lord that God's standard for the Christian life is not just something scriptural, moral, and upright. Our walk should issue from a right spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Let us consider this matter from our experience. Man's spirit is very unique. In the Bible man's spirit is neutral. Its characteristics take on that of the outer man, that is, the characteristics of the soul. The spirit itself transcends good and bad, right and wrong, yes and no, and good and evil. The spirit is the new capacity that God gives to the believers. It is special in the sense that it bears no characteristics of its own. It takes its characteristics from other things. When the self life is added to the spirit, the spirit manifests a certain characteristic. In one sense it does not have any characteristics of its own, but in another sense it does have its characteristics. Its characteristics are the characteristics of our soul. We judge the characteristics of the spirit by the characteristics of the things that are attached to it.</p><p>For example, water is colorless; it is pure. But if we add colored sugar to it, it will have a certain color and taste. The same can be said about our spirit. It is pure in itself. But the kind of person we are produces the kind of characteristics our spirit carries. Many times the brothers and sisters are right in their words and conduct, but their spirit is wrong because their very person is wrong. John 3 says that our spirit needs to be regenerated. John 4 follows by saying that we have to worship God with our spirit. A wrong spirit cannot serve the Lord.</p><p>D. L. Moody was a shoemaker's apprentice. He was an inexperienced and uneducated person. His sermons were patched together from what he heard here and there. He took note of these things and made them the content of his sermons. Once, in a gospel meeting, about five to six hundred people stood up to accept the Lord. A middle-aged lady came to him later and criticized him for saying the wrong thing. When Moody heard this, he said to her with tears in his eyes, "You know me the best. You should pray for me." She only knew how to criticize. While her words to Moody were right, her spirit was wrong. Moody was the opposite. His words might have been wrong, but his spirit was right. At that time Moody was at the height of his ministry. His humility was an outflow of his life. Some people are humble, but they are still soulish. Moody was a person who was always ready to deal with his soul and purify his spirit. This is the reason God greatly used him.</p><p>In Shanghai there was a brother by the name of Lee who did something wrong. Another brother by the name of Chow learned about it. He was sad and sorrowful and prayed desperately for Lee with fasting and tears for a whole week. Afterwards, he went to Lee to exhort him, intending to recover him with love, tears, and a meek spirit. He persuaded Lee to repent. Lee was convinced and repented, but it was only an outward repentance. Within he was still not subdued. After two years Chow committed a mistake similar to Lee's. When Lee found out, he wrote a letter to Chow immediately with only three words in it: "What about now?" If a man has the right spirit, he has tears, and he can rebuke others and recover them. But here was a person who could only exhort others. Although he only said three words, his spirit was wrong; it was an evil spirit. After Chow received Lee's three-word letter, he replied immediately, saying, "From this experience I have learned that man is weak and prone to fall. Without the Lord's mercy and grace, no one can stand. Therefore, we have to fear God." Here we see a right spirit.</p><p>A right spirit is something that God gives us; we do not have it in ourselves. When God gives us a word, we will not be self-assuming or proud. When we accept and obey such a word, we acquire a right spirit on that point. I hope we will learn to open up our spirit to receive the divine Spirit. If there is any mixture of our soul-life, our spirit will be defiled.</p><p>Saint Jials (?) was a simple man. He was a cook in a monastery in northern Italy in the Middle Ages. He was not educated and did not have much Bible knowledge. But he loved knowledge and was very fond of learning. He requested of the abbot that he be allowed to listen in on the sermons. The abbot did not grant him his wish and told him to be satisfied with being a cook. One year later there was a special conference. He requested of the abbot again but was turned down again. Later, he prayed to the Lord that he be allowed to attend the meetings. He came up with an idea. He had been baking bread and preparing food on a daily basis. He gathered the food he would need for two months, such as potatoes and ducks; then he cooked them ahead of time. When the mealtime came, he took the cooked food and warmed it up in a big pan. The monastery had never tasted food with such a strange taste. When the abbot heard about this, he rebuked the cook. That night Saint Jials could not sleep. The Lord shone on him, and he realized that every circumstance is from God. He saw his mistake, and he repented. He knew that the abbot had lost his voice, and he felt sorry for him. He prepared a bowl of porridge with sugar, took it to the abbot, and said to him, "I was wrong with the food. Please forgive me. You have lost your voice. I have prepared this porridge for you." The abbot was greatly touched by Saint Jials's word. He touched the spirit of self-denial in Saint Jials. That was the greatest supply the abbot had received in his whole life. Humanly speaking, when Saint Jials was rebuked, he could have resented it, but he did not have such a feeling. Instead, he felt for the abbot's pain and loss of voice. He volunteered to prepare food for him in the middle of the night. This is a clean spirit before the Lord. Its quality is very high.</p><p>Before the Lord, we must not only ask if we have a spirit but must pay attention to the quality of our spirit. From church history we find many brothers and sisters who had an excellent spirit, something that no ordinary men and women possess. If we learn our lessons thoroughly, and if we fellowship with God often enough, it will be easy for us to have a right spirit. But if we have not lived before the Lord all the time, our words will convey a defiled spirit. The quality of every person's spirit is very much related to his cumulative experience before the Lord during ordinary times.</p><p>Here I would like to say a word to the elders. In dealing with the young people, we should not ask whether or not they are smart. Human intelligence is useless. You do not have to deal with their gifts and functions either. All you need to do is consider if their spirit is clean. When disputes arise among the brothers and sisters, the issue is not who opens his mouth first or what the terms of settlement are, nor is it a matter of the rightness of words or conduct, but a consideration of the spirit. If you try to base your judgment on man's word, you will find it hard to determine if it is accurate or exaggerated. If you base your judgment on his conduct, you will find that the standard of right and wrong differs in different people. The law courts in the world are concerned with facts and conduct. However, our emphasis is not on words and conduct but on the spirit. In dealing with the young people, we have to see if they have a strong spirit and what kind of spirit they have. Sometimes they have a strong spirit, but such a spirit is also a defiled spirit, a coarse spirit, and an arrogant spirit. May the Lord be merciful to us that we would pay attention to man's spirit more than to his words and conduct.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p>Witness Lee: I want to ask a few questions. First, why must a servant of the Lord have a spirit? Second, how do we differentiate between rightness of motive and rightness of spirit? Third, how can we have a noble, clean, and pure spirit? Fourth, what is the result of having a clean spirit?</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for the Spirit in Serving God</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Why must we have a spirit in serving God? This has to do with the levels of life. Different lives have different levels of life, and it is hard for different levels of life to fellowship with each other. For example, the lower forms of animals and the higher forms of animals belong to different levels of life. It is hard for them to communicate with each other. Both birds and insects fly, but the way they fly is different. Every level of life has its own characteristics. It is hard for things with different characteristics to communicate with one another. This does not mean that as long as a life has a good characteristic, it can fellowship with other lives. A dog has a keener sense of smell than man, but this does not mean that it can fellowship with man. Its life is on a different level than man's. We can ask the dog to guard the house, to look for lost objects, or to find people, but it is fruitless to try to fellowship with it or to talk to it about our family affairs or feelings. We cannot fellowship with it.</p><p>Suppose Brother Yu has a dog named Tido. It only has a name, not a surname. We cannot give it a surname and call it Tido Yu, because it does not have a life relationship with Brother Yu. It is not a matter of the dog being good or bad. Its life is on a different level than Brother Yu. Man is a creature mainly of the soul, but God is Spirit. We have to say respectfully that God is also a form of life. Of course, He is the highest form of life. Even if man's wisdom is very great, he cannot possibly fellowship with God. This is the same as saying that Brother Yu's dog may be very clever, but it can never be called Tido Yu, because it is on a different level of life. Brother Yu's son may be very foolish, but he is still Brother Yu's son, and he is still called So-and-so Yu because his life is on the same level as Brother Yu.</p><p>John 4 clearly reveals that God is Spirit and they who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in reality. Everyone who seeks to serve God must serve Him in a spirit that bears the same quality as His Spirit. Our dog is lovely and our son is also lovely. We love them both, but the love we have for our dog is different from the love we have for our son. The Gentiles say that religion is something in the emotion, but John 4 tells us that we cannot serve God by our emotion. We have to serve in the spirit. Not only is our emotion unqualified; even our mind, our will, and everything that comes from our soul are unqualified to serve God. Only by remaining in the spirit can we serve God. We have to pay attention to John 3 and 4. John 4 says that God is Spirit. In order to serve Him we have to exercise our spirit. John 3 says that that which is begotten of the flesh is flesh. What my parents gave to me was just a piece of "flesh." John 3 and 4 are two great pillars in the Bible. John 4 tells us that God is Spirit, and John 3 says that that which is born of the Holy Spirit in a Christian is his spirit. Only the spirit begotten of the Holy Spirit is qualified to serve God. Only it can serve God who is Spirit. If a man does not have new life, he does not have a spirit, even if he has the best conduct. He still cannot please God.</p><p>Two persons can have the same kind of conduct, but they can bear different qualities by virtue of the fact that they belong to different levels of life. We have mentioned before that a bird flies in a different way than an insect. They belong to different levels of life. In the same way, an act that bears the nature of the divine Spirit is different in nature from an act that is void of the Spirit. A monkey can imitate a man. It can act exactly the same way as a man, but it does not have man's life. The quality of its acts is different. There is an analogy between electrical conductivity and spiritual things. Some materials conduct electricity when they are charged, but others cannot conduct electricity regardless of how long they are charged. Rubber and wood do not conduct electricity. This is not a matter of being good or bad in quality but a matter of conductivity. In the same way, if a man wants to serve God with his mind, he can never join himself to God who is Spirit. Only man's spirit can join itself to God who is Spirit.</p><p>In serving the Lord and in touching spiritual things, we can only be joined to God's Spirit in our spirit. If we are living in the mind, will, or emotion, we are "insulators" as far as God is concerned. In order to fellowship with God, the first thing we have to do is be born again. Let me repeat: This is not a matter of being good or bad in quality. Neither is it a matter of being too much or too little in quantity. It is a matter of sameness of quality. A rope, no matter how big and strong it is, can never conduct electricity. But a little wire can conduct electricity as soon as it is charged. In our service to the Lord, we must see clearly that only the spirit can contact God, who is Spirit. Similarly, when Christians come together to fellowship, they can only generate "electricity" when they exercise their spirit. When Christians come together and release their spirits in prayer and speaking, there is the flashing of divine "electricity."</p><p>When a man is regenerated, he receives a new sense from God. This is the sense of the spirit. If a man is impoverished in spirit, he can never fellowship with God or serve Him. Therefore, regeneration is not only crucial to our salvation; it is very much related to our ability to fellowship with God. This is a fundamental Christian truth. As soon as a Christian exercises his spirit toward spiritual things, all problems go away. Before a man believes in the Lord, he may have a thousand questions. He may want his questions answered before he believes in the Lord. But once he believes, even if the thousand questions still remain, he has no more place for them and no need of answers. He has touched his spirit, and all his questions are answered.</p><p>The kingdom of God is something in the Holy Spirit. This is the reason Romans 14:17 says that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. A man can only touch spiritual things with his spirit. Even if we can imitate a spiritual man's preaching and prayer, those who are experienced will know the kind of persons we really are. Only those who have a spirit and who exercise their spirit can serve God. Romans 7:6 says that we serve God according to newness of spirit. Only by exercising our spirit can we serve God in newness of spirit, and only then can we please God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE QUALITY OF THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 9, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Scripture Reading:Luke 9:51-56</h1><h2 class="head2">Motive and Spirit</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Today we will pick up from where we left off yesterday. The second question Brother Lee asked yesterday was how one can tell the difference between his motive and his spirit. Many Bible translators use the word heart instead of spirit in Luke 9:55. Some may think that the spirit here refers to a man's attitude. They think that to be right in spirit is actually to be right in attitude. But there is a big difference between spirit and attitude.</p><p>Attitude issues from motives in the heart. What then is the difference between one's spirit and his motive? Before a man is saved, he can have motives in his heart, but he does not have a spirit. A believer has motives, and he also has a spirit. It is easy for a saved person's spirit to be affected by the motives in his heart. We have said that man's spirit is neutral. A young man has to pass through thirty years of his Christian life before he realizes that his spirit is neutral. The longer you are a Christian, the more you will realize that your spirit is neutral; it has no characteristic of its own. It draws its characteristics from your very person. The spirit is neutral; it is like pure water. When you add different things to water, it assumes the characteristics of the added elements. Suppose you add soy sauce to water; the water will assume the characteristics of soy sauce. The same can be said about the human spirit. Different persons have different characteristics in their spirit. The spirit that God has given us is the same. However, our spirit becomes impure when it is released because we have impure motives in our heart. If our motive is for ourselves or for our own future and business, this motive will taint our spirit, and our spirit will carry the characteristic of this motive. The Lord said to the disciples that their spirit was wrong; their spirit was different from His. The Lord does not want anyone to die from his sins. The Son of Man came not to destroy, but to save.</p><p>The world is a strange place. No one in this world has the kind of feeling the Lord has for human life. Everyone in this world is selfish in his motive. Suppose you cannot rank first in school. When the one who ranks first in school goes into the hospital to have an operation, you want to see him die. Should this man die just because he is more intelligent than you are? Such things are commonplace in politics. If a man cannot climb to a high position, he would rather see his political opponents die. When business competition becomes fierce, some also wish that their competitors' managers would die. The disciples were wrong in their spirit because their motive was one of hatred. The Lord would not allow them to pray the way they wished. The Lord's spirit does not think that anyone deserves to die. This is the reason He said that He came to save, not to destroy. This is the Lord's heart. This is His spirit.</p><p>The disciples were wrong in their heart. This is the reason they were wrong in their spirit. The unbelievers only have a heart; they do not have a spirit. Their heart is hidden within them; it cannot show. But a saved person's spirit can flow out, and his heart can flow out with his spirit. You can guess the motive of an unbeliever from his speaking. But with a Christian, it is not a matter of guessing. Something definite comes out of his being, and all who are experienced can identify it. The heart is hidden within an unsaved person, but a Christian's heart flows out with his spirit. When a Christian's spirit is released, another Christian touches something if he is exercising his spirit. A man can deceive others with his words, but his spirit cannot hide from an experienced person.</p><h2 class="head2">How to Have a Right Spirit</h2><p>How can we have a right spirit? A man's spirit carries his own taste and color. When our spirit is released, it expresses the tastes and color of our very person. In order to be right in our spirit, we have to go through dealings. The quality of a man determines the quality of his spirit. When a man is regenerated, the new spirit that God gives him is the same in quality as that which is given to any other person. If a man learns little and goes through few dealings, his spirit will remain in darkness. Doctrinally, this matter is very simple. A man with a good mind can repeat the content, tone, teaching, and style of a preacher. He may think that he has the right spirit by doing this. But we can observe a very interesting thing among Christians. They can pick up others' doctrines, yet their spirit remains unchanged; the two will not mix. A brother can be the same as others are in words and tone, but his spirit will remain the same as before. There will not be any advance; his spirit will not be any purer. If a man does not have a pure spirit, he will find that his spirit is incompatible with the good words released from those with a pure spirit. He can give another person's message, but he will not have the other person's spirit.</p><p>The Lord has given me a burden to test if young workers are qualified to work for the Lord. Most brothers and sisters think that in working for the Lord the main thing is to have right teachings. But I only pay ten percent of my attention to a person's message. I pay ninety percent of my attention to his spirit. A man can give a logical message but have a rebellious, coarse, nit-picking, evil, proud, or hardened spirit. The unbelievers can only be proud; they cannot have a proud spirit. A Christian can have a proud spirit. When he opens his mouth, he releases his spirit. If a Christian has a wrong motive in his heart, the spirit he releases will be wrong. A young person can pray for breaking; he can give a message on breaking, but his very person may still not be broken. It is possible for a man to deceive himself, but it is not easy to deceive God and the church. The church can tell where a person is from his spirit.</p><p>A man's spirit is the place where God works and dwells. God leaves His imprint in a man's spirit. A brother once wrote to me, saying, "All the brothers and sisters say that I am wrong. Even you say that I am wrong. It seems that everyone is right and I am always wrong. Since all of you say that I am wrong, I will just say that I am wrong." Such a word conveyed a hardened spirit. After I read the letter, I wrote back to him, saying, "The more you are smitten, the harder you become. The more you are dealt with, the less you submit. Your words and conduct may be right, but your spirit is wrong." A few months ago, I saw this brother again. His spirit was changed. He had not picked up more doctrines, but the quality of his spirit was enhanced. We have the same opportunity to exercise our spirit as any other brother or sister. When a certain person has greater wisdom, eloquence, ability, and gift than you do, he does not necessarily have greater opportunity to exercise his spirit. God arranges all circumstances and things with the goal of dealing with ourselves and training our spirit. For this reason, we have to give in more to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Here we need to speak about the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not only in us as our life; He is ordering our circumstances for the purpose of training us. He knows the kind of environment that is best for us. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Every environment that comes upon us has been measured by our God. The unbelievers have accidents and coincidences, but not a Christian. The Lord Jesus tells us that every hair on our head is numbered by the Father. A sparrow may not be worth much. If a man buys four, he gets one extra for free. But without the Father's permission, not one will fall to the ground. We are more precious than the birds (Matt. 10:29-31). Everything that is happening to us in our environment, even the falling of a hair and the grounding of a bird, is under God's sovereignty. The purpose of this sovereignty is to perfect us. The daily discipline of the Holy Spirit is for the purpose of dealing with the self and destroying it. In this way the quality of the spirit is enhanced and purified. If we seek for ease and comfort and run away from the Spirit-ordered environments, we may reduce our troubles, but the quality of our spirit will not be enriched and purified.</p><p>Those who have an impoverished spirit were not impoverished at the beginning; they became impoverished because they refused to allow the Lord to work in them. If we are willing to submit ourselves to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, our spirit will become strong and pure.</p><p>A person may be a Christian for twenty or thirty years. He may even have been a revivalist conducting revivals for thirty years. These things do not impress me at all. With some people we do not sense any noble quality in their spirit. If a man's spirit is good, we will feel refreshed and anointed as soon as we touch it. All the lessons that we have learned are impregnated in our spirit. It is impossible to pretend. The more we try to pretend, the more our falsehood will be exposed. Many people like to pretend to be spiritual in front of me; they want my approval. A sister in Shanghai once said that Brother Nee never praises anyone. She thought that no one was up to my standard. Actually, the only One who is qualified to approve of anyone is the Lord. A spiritual man will find the Lord's approval automatically. If your spirit is wrong, what use is there for me to say that I like you or that I approve you? Some people hate with all their heart but say that they love with their mouth. What comes out of the mouth is love, but what comes out of the spirit is hatred. If we are experienced, we will know as soon as we touch one's spirit. A man can pretend and cheat others, but he can never hide his spirit.</p><p>Many people are right in their words and thoughts, but they are wrong in their spirit. The quality of our spirit is governed by the extent of discipline of the Holy Spirit we have received. When the Holy Spirit condemns something, we should go along with Him and condemn the same. If we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit every day and learn to deal with our self, we will advance every day. We may not be conscious of our own progress, but others will know. In Shanghai people often knock on my door and ask to see me. When they see me, they ask, "Brother Nee, has my spirit made any progress?" Those who ask such questions usually have not made any progress. Progress is not something that we can easily detect in ourselves. Others know how our spirit is, but we do not need to know, and it is best that we not know. Moses' face shone, but he did not know it. It was the Israelites who saw it (Exo. 34:29-30). Suppose a man looks into a mirror all the time. Do you think he will find himself greatly changed from the day before? Do you think that he will know whether or not he has grown? I have never seen such a person. No one should consider his spiritual condition all the time. All we need is to learn as much as we can in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Having a Good Spirit</h2><p>What is the result of having a sterling spirit? If all the brothers and sisters in the church have a pure and noble spirit, they will mutually supply one another, and the church will be rich.</p><p>I became a Christian at the end of 1919. At the beginning of 1920 I met a sister, Miss M. E. Barber, from whom I received much help. This help did not come merely from her words. Through meeting with her, staying or walking with her, my spirit was nourished. With some people one receives the supply only when they speak. With Miss Barber this was not the case. She only needed to sit in front of you, and you would receive nourishment and the anointing. This is the genuine spiritual supply. It is not a matter of doing something or saying something. Whoever learns more lessons has more spiritual deposit and can render more supply to others.</p><h2 class="head1">IN ORDER TO SERVE, WE MUST FIRST LEARN<br />TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We are learning to serve as the church. We must have proper spiritual feelings. We must contact the spirit all the time. Otherwise, all the so-called services to God will be nothing but self-deceptions. Our service to God must be the result of our spiritual response to Him. When spirit touches spirit, there is a spiritual response. In order for our spirit to be touched, others' spirit must first touch us. A man's joy, tears, or words cannot touch our spirit. Only spirit can touch spirit. In order to serve God and to receive His leading, we must open our spirit to God to touch His Spirit and others' spirit. Every service that is void of the spirit carries no value before God. In order for the whole church to have a service that is spiritual, we must have a right spirit. When my spirit opens up and the spirits of all the brothers and sisters open up, and when all of us touch God and serve Him in our spirit, we have the service of the whole church. If we serve according to our mind, wisdom, and emotion, our spirit will be closed. The exercise of the spirit is a great matter in our meeting and service. We must all learn to walk according to the spirit.</p><p>How do we know if something is done correctly in the church? It depends on how our spirit reacts and judges it. Our judgment and fellowship are based on the spirit, not on the preponderance of opinions. In preaching the gospel, if our speaking only issues from our "wonderful" mind, we will only touch others' mind; we will not touch their spirit. In order to touch man's spirit, we have to learn to not use words from our mind. We should not use words that the spirit does not use. If we continue to reject what the spirit rejects, our spirit will be high.</p><p>In the coming days, our judgment of a co-worker's message, our evaluation of the brothers' and sisters' testimonies, and our assessment of the sermons of the revivalists should be based on the spirit of the speakers. We should ask if there is a supply of the spirit. Once a blind man sees, he will exercise his other faculties less and use his eyes more. We can say the same thing about our spirit. We have to learn to use our spirit more and our mind less. The more we use the organs in our body, such as our arm and muscles, the stronger they become. The same is true with our spirit; the more we use it, the stronger it becomes.</p><p>Let me say this to the young brothers and sisters: If you sense much prompting in your spirit while you pray, you can pray more. But if there is little prompting in your spirit, your prayer should be short. We can learn by checking with the older brothers and sisters every time after we pray. After we have learned this a few times, we will know the true condition of our spirit, and we can pray according to the spirit. When we pray and hear many "amens" around us, it does not mean that we are necessarily right. Of course, if there is no "amen," we should put a question mark on our prayer and should try to determine whether or not it was of the spirit. Short prayer is not necessarily right; neither is long prayer. Much noise may not be right, and silence may not be right either. If our speaking and silence are not under the control of the Holy Spirit, they are both an offense to the Spirit. The young brothers and sisters are inexperienced in their learning. Therefore, they must learn to humble themselves and ask. If the saints feel that someone's prayer or speaking is out of place, they should point this out to the speaker in an honest way. If they do not tell the speaker, but "send telegraphs" by glancing around behind his back, they are forming parties in the church.</p><p>We must not coordinate together in an outward way. Our spirit must be weighty and excellent in its quality. May God be merciful to us so that we may learn more lessons this way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">A REPORT ON THE GOSPEL MIGRATION<br />TO YI-YANG</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 10, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">A REPORT ON THE GOSPEL MIGRATION TO YI-YANG</h2><p>At the end of 1948 there was flooding around Shiao-Shan, Chekiang province. The local brothers considered this to be a sign of God's sovereign hand in urging them to migrate to other places. They began to move to Yi-Yang in Chekiang. At the beginning of 1949 the first group of brothers and sisters settled in Yi-Yang. These brothers and sisters practiced the communal life. They learned to love one another, and they dealt strictly with the flesh. Thank the Lord that He has blessed His children through their obedience to Him. The number of migrating ones increased day by day. Now the saints in Yi-Yang are contemplating a further move to two or three neighboring localities. The soil in these neighboring lands is two to four times richer than in Yi-Yang. All the brothers and sisters who have moved to Yi-Yang work with their own hands. They earn their own living with their two hands.</p><p>Nanchang is an important town in Kiangsi; it is very close to Yi-Yang. Presently, several dozen brothers and sisters are moving to Nanchang from Shanghai.</p><p>All the major cities are gospel bases for spreading the gospel to surrounding places. We have to "capture and occupy" these places as soon as possible.</p><p>The brothers and sisters who have migrated to Yi-Yang have set up a good pattern. The government radio station in Nanchang has made many public announcements, asking people everywhere to go and learn from Yi-Yang, Chu-Chi, Yin-Tang, Chao-Bin, Lung-Fu-Shan, etc.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF GOSPEL MIGRATION</h2><p>Our present way of gospel preaching is not through sending one or two missionaries to a place. The way today is the way of gospel migration by the whole church. This is like paratroopers. The whole church moves forward. In order to prepare themselves for the migration, the brothers and sisters have to pick up trades that allow them to work with their own hands. Those who are preparing for migration must learn to work with their hands, even if this means working as a barber, a tailor, or a blacksmith.</p><p>Migration can teach us many things. For example, it is not easy to practice having all things in common in the cities. But in such places as Yi-Yang and Chu-Chi, it is easy to practice having all things in common; there is no problem with such a practice.</p><p>The new government has adopted a new philosophy. The basic principle of its philosophy is the principle of equalization, but they are afraid that when everyone becomes equal, some will become lazy. This is the reason they have to keep a close eye on everyone. To the new government, equalization is something very hard to practice. But this does not pose any hardship for us, the Christians. We love one another, and we love our neighbors as ourselves. In Yi-Yang the elderly and sick ones are fed even better than the others.</p><p>The present urgent need is the spreading of the gospel. There are over two million people in the northwestern part of Kiangsi. We have only a little over two hundred brothers and sisters. This is less than a hundredth of one percent. I hope that in the near future, the gospel will spread out quickly from them.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE SALVATION OF GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 10, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Gen. 1:26-27; 2:7, 16-17; John 1:4, 12-13; 10:10b; 12:24; Rom. 8:28-30, 6</h1><p>Witness Lee: I still feel that Brother Nee should say something. This is why my burden is not that strong. However, I do have a feeling to say a word or two. When Brother Nee spoke a few nights ago, I had a strong feeling within myself. The brothers and sisters have not understood too much of what Brother Nee has said these days. They are still rather inexperienced in the spiritual things. They are like students who are not good at English and must start from the ABC's. Two nights ago it seemed Brother Nee could not quite release what he wanted to release in the first part of his message. Indeed, he was restricted by us. I must therefore start from something simple.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING GOD'S SALVATION FROM GOD'S PERSPECTIVE</h2><p>I was saved twenty-five years ago. My salvation was a good one. It was thorough and strong. I was not only saved from sin but from the world as well. I was not saved from the world slowly. As soon as I was saved, I was released from the bondage of the world. In spite of this, it was ten years before I began to stand on God's side to see His salvation from His perspective. Prior to this, I looked at God's salvation from my perspective. God's perspective of salvation is far different from my perspective. In the past we spoke as ministers of God's word from God's perspective. But His children view salvation from their perspective. This is because they are occupied with their own preconceived ideas. Many Christians think that the work of the ministry of the word is to see things from their perspective. This is absolutely wrong; we should turn things the other way around. We do not speak from the believers' perspective but from God's perspective. The brothers and sisters often nod their head at whatever we say, but in reality they may not have seen anything. May we drop our concepts about God's salvation and receive it from God's perspective.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO RECEIVE SALVATION</h2><p>There are two ways to describe God's salvation. The first is an ascent from man to God. The second is a descent from God to man. The book of Romans takes the first way. Chapter one tells us about a sinful man who starts climbing up from his sinful condition. This ascent continues until 8:28-30, when it reaches the peak in glory. The Gospel of John takes the second way. It starts from God and descends to man. In speaking about experience, we start from man and move upward. But in speaking about the objective truth, we start from God and move to man. In speaking about the tabernacle itself, we see the ark and then move outward to the altar in the outer court. But in man's experience, he first touches the altar and then proceeds to enter the Holy of Holies to meet God. Today we need both aspects. We need revelation that starts from God, and we need revelation that starts from man. Under normal circumstances and in the normal way, a man first receives revelation from God and then has the experience of salvation. Then he ascends to God through the revelation he has received. The problem today is that many people start from man's side. This is the reason so many are groping in the dark and cannot find God's vision and revelation.</p><p>This is like a man looking for direction; there are two ways he can take. He can use a map to find where he is and which direction he is facing. After he is clear about these, he will proceed with little difficulty and much confidence. The other way is not to use a map but to search around, asking for the way as he moves along. People who take this way end up in the wrong place easily. They can go around in circles, or they can even be heading in the exact opposite direction.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF GOD'S SALVATION</h2><p>In the past I thought that God's salvation was to save me from hell and sin, but these are actually not the first items of God's salvation. According to His plan and from His perspective, God's salvation primarily is not to deal with sin. Before 1934 I suffered much. I was painfully aware of my inward sins, my critical attitude, my jealousy, and my temper. The gross sins were gone from me the day I was saved. For a long time, however, I was living in the experience of Romans 7. At that time I thought that God's salvation was primarily to deal with my sins. From 1934 onward I began to touch some light. During 1935 and 1936 I touched more. By 1940 I was quite clear. For a while I was so released that I would laugh, jump, and praise unceasingly.</p><h2 class="head2">The Revelation of Genesis 1 and 2&mdash;<br />God's Image and God's Life</h2><p>During the past few years, the light I have seen from God involves mainly two things. First, God created man to have His image (Gen. 1:26). Second, God wants man to have His life. According to Genesis 1:26-27, God created man with the intention that man would have His image. This is the first time the Bible speaks of God's relationship with man. The second time the Bible speaks of God's relationship with man is in Genesis 2:7. After God created man with the dust of the earth, He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life. This means that God not only created man in His image; His intention was to dispense His life into man. The second time the Bible speaks of God's relationship with man is when it speaks about God's image and His life. What is God's purpose in man? He wants every one of us to have His image and His life.</p><p>According to our natural concept, we think that the goal of God's salvation is to save us from sin. God's salvation does include our deliverance from sin, but we have to realize that the main item in God's salvation is for us to have His image and His life. This is something very high and great. If the brothers and sisters have not seen this, and they only pay attention to their services, they have not yet reached the central goal of God's salvation. God's intention in creating man is for man to have His image and His life.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Goal Being Frustrated</h2><p>Man was created, but he did not have God's life within him. God intended, anticipated, and ordained that man would eat the tree of life. This means that man would receive the life of God. However, before man received God's life, Satan came in to frustrate. Through his temptation, man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. From that point forward, man deviated from the central goal; he sinned and fell. As a result, he was kept away from God's life. God sealed the way to the tree of life. He guarded the way to that tree with the cherubim (signifying God's glory) and the sword (signifying God's holiness) of fire (signifying God's righteousness) which turned every way.  In order to draw near to the tree of life for its fruit, a man must pass through the cherubim, the fire, and the sword. This means that in order for man to receive God into him as life, he has to meet God's requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory. At the end of Genesis 3, man could not match God's righteousness and holiness, and he came short of God's glory. Hence, man could not receive God's life into him.</p><h2 class="head2">The Giving of the Law</h2><p>From Genesis 3 we move on to Exodus 20. There we have the giving of the law. Twenty-five hundred years after man's creation, God gave His law on Mount Sinai. There God was surrounded by His righteousness, holiness, and glory. God was inside, and man was outside. Man could not draw near to Him. Because man did not realize his own depravity, there was the need to institute the law. But we have to know that in giving His law to man, God had no intention for man to keep it. On the contrary, He wanted man to break it. If man were to keep the law, God's plan would have been fully frustrated. Man, perhaps, would be in turmoil and be at Mount Sinai even today. Please remember that God does not expect man to keep the law. He wants to put His life into us. We want to be delivered from our temper, but God wants us to lose our temper. We want to be perfect, and we want God to help us, but God does not have such a thought at all. His salvation is not for making us perfect. His goal is for man to be like Him, to have His life and His image.</p><p>The story at Mount Sinai in Exodus is only a replay of the story in Eden in Genesis. In Eden there were two trees. One was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The other was the tree of life. After man was tempted by Satan to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and fell, there were cherubim, the sword, and the fire around the tree of life. This means that God's righteousness, glory, and holiness guarded the tree. In Exodus we also find fire on Mount Sinai, a sign of God's holiness. We have the law, which refers to God's righteousness, and we have God's glory itself. In Eden we have the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. On Mount Sinai we have the knowledge of good and evil in the law. Just as God had no intention for man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, He had no intention for man to keep the law. This is God's consistent goal. Hence, the scene at Mount Sinai was merely a replay of the scene in Eden.</p><h2 class="head2">The Revelation in the Gospel of John&mdash;Life</h2><h2 class="head3">Life Being in Christ</h2><p>From Sinai we move forward for a thousand years to the New Testament. The apostle John saw that life is in Christ (John 1:4). I believe the purpose of John's word is to bring us back to Genesis 2 and 3. It shows us that the life represented by the tree of life in Eden is in Christ. The life which God spoke of at the beginning is in Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">The Lord Coming for Us to Have Life</h2><p>The Lord declared in John 10:10: "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly." The Lord's intention in coming to the earth is for man to have the life of God. Following this He shows us how we can have His life.</p><p>The above points are the most basic yet crucial things in the Bible. Every point requires seven or eight days to speak about it. Some people have said that all denominations do the same thing, which is to exhort men to believe in Jesus, love the Lord, follow Him, preach the gospel, and love one another. It is true that persuading men to believe in the Lord, live a good Christian life, love the Lord, and follow Him are all good things. But I hope that the brothers and sisters would spend time to study the more crucial things in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head3">How God's Life Can Come into Man</h2><p>After the Lord spoke about His coming for man to have life in John 10, we see in chapter twelve the way His life gets into man. Verse 24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." Within a grain of wheat is life. How can this life be released? It must die. If the grain does not die, it remains a single grain. But if it falls into the ground and dies and then resurrects, the life of this grain will get into many other grains. This means that in order for the Lord to enter into man as life, He must pass through the process of death and resurrection. Here we would like to point out that John's way of speaking about the Lord's death is different from ours. We think that the Lord's death is for our redemption, but this was not John's thought. He had no intention of telling us that the Lord's death was for redemption. When he spoke of the Lord's death, his emphasis was not on redemption but on life. The falling of a grain of wheat to the ground has nothing to do with sin. It has to do with the release of life. Of the four Gospels, only the Gospel of John says that blood and water flowed out at the Lord's death. We know that the Lord shed His blood for the washing of our sins. The issue of water from the Lord's side, however, refers to the dispensing of life.</p><p>John 1:18 says that the Lord is the only Begotten in the bosom of the Father. But in chapter twenty, after the Lord resurrected from the dead, He told Mary, "I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (v. 17). Hallelujah, through the Lord's death and resurrection, life entered into many people. The one grain became many grains. The Father of One has now become the Father of many. These are the things that a servant of the Lord has to pay attention to in his pathway of service to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">How to Receive God's Life</h2><p>John also shows us how we can receive God's life into us. John 1:12 says that as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name. On the Lord's side He released His life through death. On our side we receive His life through believing. When we receive the Lord, His life enters into us, and we become the children of God. These children are begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Peak of God's Salvation<br />in Romans 8 and Its Experience</h2><p>Romans 8:28-30 shows that God causes all things to work together in order that His life would shine out of us. Today God's children misapply Romans 8:28. They think that "all things work[ing] together for good to those who love God" means receiving blessing and peace, etc. For example, a man may try to catch a train but is delayed; he misses the train. But by missing it, he has avoided a train accident. Such a man would thank and praise God that all things indeed have worked together for him to have peace and blessing. I dare not say that the expression "all things work together for good" does not include peace and blessing. But this verse is not mainly on blessing and peace. God's central thought is not on blessing and peace but on our perfection through the environment. The goal of this perfection is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son.</p><p>How different is man's view from God's emphasis! Man pays attention to blessing and peace, but God causes all things to work together for good for the purpose that the life within us would be released through us. For example, do we put a spoonful of lemon extract into water and leave it there? No, we stir the water with the spoon so that the lemon extract can dissolve into the water. In this way the cup of water becomes lemon juice. This stirring is the "working together of all things." God stirs up our environment in order that we can be mingled with God's life and that His life may be manifested through us. This is the reason verse 29 speaks of our conformation to the image of God's Son. If we cooperate with His life, we will have God's life within and His image without.</p><p>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace." This tells us that we have God's life inwardly and have God's sovereign arrangements outwardly. The outward arrangements match the inward life. The life within issues from the mingling of God's Spirit with our spirit. God's Spirit lives within us. The life within us demands that our spirit cooperate with God's life. The main thing is that the spirit within us must follow the Holy Spirit. If we obey Him and follow Him, the result will be life and peace. Let suffering and blessing come as they may. We do not care for the outward environment. We only care for the operation of the Holy Spirit within us. The result of obeying and following is life and peace. When we say that we should touch the spirit, we are talking about touching this kind of spirit. If we set our mind on the spirit, we will have life and peace within. This life is very rich. I have only spoken of a few crucial points. In the future we will talk more about how we can go along with the operation of the Holy Spirit within us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Consummation<br />of God's Salvation in Revelation&mdash;<br />God's Life Shining Out from Man</h2><p>In Revelation we find the same thing spoken of at the beginning of the Bible&mdash;the tree of life, the fruit of life, the glory of God, etc. In Revelation we find a group of people who are finally joined to God. They will see God. Within them is the life of God. This life will shine out as the shining of God's glory. There God and man are fully mingled together. In the new heaven and new earth, temper and patience will no longer be a problem to man. God's life will shine out through man. When God's life shines out of man, there is no longer a question of sin. A Christian's goal is the New Jerusalem. For this reason, we should not have holiness and a good temper as the standard. God is not saving us from pride to humility, from unholiness to holiness, from a bad temper to a good temper. His intention is that His own life would shine out of us. This is not a matter of sinless perfection, but a matter of God's life shining out of us; it is God's glory expressed.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S GOAL BEING TO DISPENSE LIFE TO MAN</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Sin occupies only a small place in the Bible. It takes up only a small part of it. We can say that sin in the Bible is incidental or accidental. Sin is not a big subject. Before man sinned, God placed him in front of the tree of life. God ordained man to have life before he ever sinned. Hence, it was not just a sinful Adam who had need of life. A sinless Adam had need of it as well.</p><p>We have the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. One supplies life and the other brings in vanity. Suppose there are two cups on this table. One is empty and the other is filled with water. If we take the cup with water, we will receive the supply. Otherwise, we will remain thirsty. In the same way, if we eat of the tree of life, we will surely receive the supply of life. Otherwise, we will remain empty. In the whole Bible only two books speak of the beginning. Genesis starts with In the beginning God.., while the Gospel of John begins with In the beginning was the Word. The beginning in John precedes the beginning in Genesis. Both books are on life. This shows us that from the beginning, God's attention has been on life. To us, sin is the main problem. But to God, life is His emphasis. God gave us His Son primarily for the purpose of life, not for removing sins. We often confuse the focus and the emphasis. At times we miss the subject altogether.</p><p>God's purpose in creating man is for man to receive His life. But it is man's responsibility to take this life. God created man, yet man has to eat the fruit of the tree himself. God created Adam, but he did not create a fruit and put it directly in Adam's stomach. Man's responsibility is to eat of the fruit of the tree of life and to receive God's life into him. The basic problem with the world is not sin, but the lack of life. In Genesis 2 God had only one concern, which was that man would eat of the tree of life and receive life. By Genesis 3 God had another concern; there was a twofold complication&mdash;sin plus the need of life. Today man's plight is that he only remembers the problem of sin; he forgets that there is also the matter of life. Nothing frustrates God's salvation as much as sin. God's salvation is for us to have His life and for God's only begotten Son to become His firstborn Son and our Brother.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE SALVATION OF GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Saturday evening, March 11, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:John 1:14, 16-18; Rom. 8:6, 9-11, 13-14, 28-30</h1><p>Witness Lee: The goal of God's salvation has always been to put His life into man and to make it man's life. This goal was foreordained by God before the foundation of the world. Before the world ever came into being, God planned to work His life into a group of people and to express this life through them.</p><h2 class="head1">COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF SALVATION</h2><p>Unfortunately, during the past two thousand years of church history, very few people have seen this light clearly. Most people do not see this light. Perhaps you are one of them. Your view of God's salvation may be something like this: Our forefather Adam fell. He incurred a debt of sin before God and committed acts of sin within himself (Rom. 5:12). This fallen man could not remove his sinful debt or turn from sinful acts no matter how hard he tried. On the one hand, man has inherited the debt of sin in Adam; he is condemned by God. On the other hand, he has the life of sin within him, and spontaneously he commits acts of sin outwardly. The result is condemnation by God. But one day the Lord Jesus, the second man, came. He came as the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:47, 45). He died and shed His blood for us, thus settling our sinful debt. This is not all. His salvation saves us from a life of sin. This is a higher realization. Those who do not have such a high realization only know that they are sinners and that they cannot go to heaven if they do not believe in Jesus. If they believe in Him they will have peace, and the Holy Spirit will come upon them. When they die one day, they will enter blissful enjoyment in heaven.</p><p>Although our concept may not be that low, we have to admit that our view of God's salvation is not as high as God's. If our understanding of God's salvation is according to the above description, we have taken God's salvation as a crutch to solve only our problem of sin. If all we know is that man has sinned and is suffering and that he can go to heaven and have joy through faith in Jesus, we have a very elementary, simple, superficial, and shallow understanding. Some may have seen something higher. They may see that a man has inherited nothing but sin and death in Adam. Once he is in Christ he is justified and liberated. But a person who knows God's salvation to this extent can only say that God's salvation delivers him from sin and death. In his daily living and in his dealings with God, he is concerned with one thing only&mdash; deliverance from sin. He deals with unclean thoughts, transgressions with the tongue, jealousy, pride, etc. But if we were completely delivered from sin today, would we still need God's salvation? Perhaps we think that we are justified before God as long as we have the right view and live a righteous, pure, and virtuous life, not losing our temper or casting evil eyes on others. If we have uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord and are meek, right in our words and conduct, and fully submissive to inner, spiritual feelings, have we reached God's goal? Suppose we are fully satisfied with our personal life and have fully realized our spiritual aspirations. Does this mean that God's salvation is fully realized in us?</p><h2 class="head1">AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF GOD'S SALVATION</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, this is a very serious matter. We think that we know God's salvation. Actually, we are far from God's perspective. Yesterday I said that Christians are like those who do not understand their ABC's yet who try to learn English. They do not understand even the basic teachings of the Christian life. In the word of one brother, they do not know the very first lesson of the human life. Even if a man can achieve an inward moral cultivation, like Wang Yang-ming [a Chinese philosopher], he is still acting in an outward way; he is a tree without roots and a river without a source. Even if we can be like Job, fearing God and eschewing evil, and even if Satan cannot accuse us, is this all God's salvation will do in us? Is this our only understanding of His salvation? This is the reason I have a heavy burden. I cannot let this matter go by easily. (Brother Nee: "That is right!")</p><p>Let me ask Brother Kwo-kwang, "Are you hoping that you will become blameless, upright, humble, and virtuous after you are revived? Are you hoping that what you think, what you see with your eyes, and what you say with your mouth will be right, and that your conscience will be fully at peace in God? Do you think that it is enough to have all these things before God?" (Brother Kwo-kwang: "I have never thought of this.") This is probably true. Not only have you never thought of this; perhaps many of us here have never thought of this. This is the reason I have to tell you and everyone else that God's salvation is ultimately not for delivering us from sin but for imparting life to us.</p><p>It is true that in His salvation, our sinful history before God is dealt with on the objective side, and the sin within us is taken care of on the subjective side. But this is not God's final destination. The ultimate goal of God's salvation is to bring us into His life. What is God's salvation? God's salvation is for Him to come forth, to enter into us to be our life, and for us to live in His life and to remain there.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br />AND THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>Let me ask again: What is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and what is the tree of life? What is the difference between these two trees? Simply put, the difference is the difference between law and grace. The consequence of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death, and the consequence of the tree of life is life. Within the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are good, evil, and knowledge. These things, together with the death that comes with them, are included in this tree. The skill that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil renders is the ability to know, and the end is death. But the tree of life is God, and the end is God coming to us as life. Once God comes forth, and man touches Him, he has life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is something entirely outside of God. The result of touching this tree is surely death. As a Christian we are revived. Before we were revived, we touched evil. Now that we are revived, we touch good. But whatever we touch, we are still touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Please remember that good and evil belong to the same tree. Neither good nor evil belongs to life. The acts of the Chinese bandits are, of course, not life. But the virtuous acts of the Chinese sages such as Confucius, Mencius, and Wang Yang-ming are not life either. In Chinese Christianity, many sermons are Bible-based Confucianism. This is a grave error. If we only touch good, the result is nothing but death. Only by touching God Himself will we have life.</p><p>It was not that easy for Adam to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because that tree was outside of him. Today it is easy for us to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because this tree is inside us. Actually, we are almost this very tree itself. Today we have a harder job than Adam had in dealing with this matter. This tree is within us today; it is very subjective to us. At the beginning, Adam had to consider before taking of that tree; it was still objective to him. But this tree is very subjective to us. We can take it without any consideration at all. Thank the Lord that Christ's salvation is in the tree of life, not in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Brothers and sisters, please remember that touching good is not the same as touching the spirit. We should not think that as long as we have touched good, we have touched life. We should not presume that once we have touched good, we have touched God. Our pride is not life, and our humility is not life. Our rashness is not life, and our meekness is not life. Evil is not life, and good is not life. What then is life? Only that which is from God is life. Life is not a matter of good and evil. Life certainly is not evil, but neither is life good. Although life is bright, holy, and good, it is not the goodness of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; it is the goodness that belongs to God Himself (Matt. 19:17). Life is God Himself; life is Christ (John 1:4).</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE</h2><p>Let me ask again: What is the difference between law and grace? First, let us consider what the law is. The law is something from God and yet apart from God. It tells us what is good and what is evil. For a man to touch the law is like touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. No one can have life through touching the law (Gal. 3:11, 21). On the contrary, condemnation follows the law. As soon as we touch the law, we touch condemnation. What then is grace? John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. Grace is God received, and truth is God seen. The highest and ultimate definition of grace is God Himself (1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 2:20). What is the law in the Bible? Everything that is outside of God is the law. This is the meaning of the word outwardly in the following verses: "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter" (Rom. 2:28-29). The Jews mortify their own flesh. They circumcise themselves and keep the law and the Sabbath, but these things are of the law and are letters. God is not in them. Grace is God alone and nothing else besides Him. Therefore, receiving grace means that man receives God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF GOD'S SALVATION</h2><p>God's salvation saves us to the point where we can stand before God and say, "I do not know what is evil, and I do not know what is good. I will not do evil, but neither will I do good. Both good and evil are foreign things to me. I only know to receive God as my life. I want to live by God's nature." Outwardly in Romans 2 refers to all the good outside of God, and inwardly in this passage describes everything that issues from God; it actually refers to God Himself. A man must first be delivered from the self before he can be fully delivered from sin. We may not have a temper, but as long as we are not delivered from the self, we are not delivered from sin. Within us, there is no goodness, only sin (Rom. 7:14, 18; 3:12). Let us use the kerosene lamp as an illustration. When the kerosene lamp burns, it gives out smoke. The only way it will not give out smoke is when it does not burn. A Christian is someone who has an "electric light" installed within. God is not concerned about burning or smoking anymore. He only wants to know if we are using the "electric light" or if we are still using our "kerosene lamp." If we refuse to use the "electric light" and insist on the "kerosene lamp," we can only choose between burning with smoke or not having any light at all.</p><p>The entire Bible shows us that it is God's pleasure to enter into man, pass through man, and then come out of man. God likes to be touched by man. This is the reason life is in Christ. God is in life, and life is in Christ for us to receive (1 John 5:12). As soon as we touch the Spirit, we receive the life of Christ, which means we receive God Himself. Christ is the coming out of God (Heb. 1:3). When God enters into us, Christ enters into us, which is life entering into us. God has ordained this from the first day. He desires to join Himself to man so that His life, nature, mind, light, likes, dislikes, and preferences can become ours. The ultimate goal of God's salvation is to come into us to be our life. This means His mind, preferences, likes, and dislikes become our mind, preferences, likes, and dislikes. The goal of God's salvation is to bring us to the point where we can praise Him for delivering us not only from evil, but from good as well. We can proudly say that we do not know evil and we do not know good. We do not know hatred, and we do not know love. We only know God, and we only have God. In other words, we do not live in ourselves any longer; instead, we live in God. This is God's salvation.</p><p>God's salvation saves us from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to the tree of life. Even if Adam had not sinned, God would still have wanted him to take Him as life. He wants man to take His life as his life, His feeling as his feeling, His mind as his mind, and His preference as his preference. He wants to mingle Himself with man. When God's salvation has reached its goal and the work of salvation is complete in eternity, we will see a wonderful picture: God will be in man and man will be in God. In the New Jerusalem in eternity, there will be no other fruit except the fruit of the tree of life. All of us will eat the fruit of the tree of life; we will only be enjoying God's life.</p><p>God's salvation does more than save us from sinfulness to sinlessness or from evil to good. His salvation wroughts Himself into us to be our life and everything. In learning to serve and to know our spirit, we have to touch this point. Otherwise, everything will be outward, not inward. I hope that we all will see clearly the central goal of God's salvation so that our service and spiritual ministry will be calibrated according to this central goal.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S GOAL BEING TO DISPENSE LIFE TO MAN</h2><p>Watchman Nee: If Adam had not sinned, would God have reached His goal? No! Adam was created by God, but he was not begotten by God. The angels were created by God. Cattle, sheep, trees, and, of course, man were all created by God. If man had not sinned, at the most he would have been the highest creature; he still would not have had God's life. God's goal is to dispense His life into the created man. Unless His life enters into man, His goal is not reached. Hebrews 2 says that God wants to bring many sons into glory. When He leads many sons into glory, God's goal is attained (v. 10). In Genesis 2 Adam did not lose his temper; he did not lie. He and Eve did not argue or fight as husband and wife, but even before they fell, they had need of life. They did not need life only after they fell. Whether or not Adam sinned, he still needed God's life. From the beginning God ordained that man would have His life.</p><h2 class="head1">ADAM'S FALL</h2><p>What was Adam's sin? First, we have to know that Adam did not commit any sin of lying, reviling, stealing, envying, or arrogance. What he committed was the sin of knowing good and evil. When a man knows good and evil, he has sinned. The knowledge of good and evil is sin itself. Some may ask: Did Adam know good and evil before he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Of course he did. If a man does not know good and evil, he must be mentally deranged. Adam was not mentally deranged; he gave names to all the animals. He knew his zoology well. How then did he know good and evil? He knew it by asking God. His knowledge of good and evil came from God. He did not have any knowledge of good and evil in himself, but after he was tempted to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he could say, "Now I know good and evil. Now I can tell the difference between the two. I no longer have to ask God." Adam had confidence in himself. He did not need to ask God. He knew what was right and what was wrong. It was not a big sin to eat the fruit, but after he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he began to know good and evil in himself, and he began to live according to this knowledge. After man knew good and evil, he became evil in reality because he became independent from that day onward. The root of sin is independence.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING GOD'S SALVATION IN LIFE</h2><p>Because Adam sinned, all of his descendants have sinned. How can we remove sin today? Moreover, the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). How can we overcome death? Only life can deal with both sin and death. If we deal with our temper per se, we can never be freed from it. Paul was clear that he could never rid himself of sin by his own willing. He could keep nine of the Ten Commandments in the law. But he could not keep one&mdash;the law forbidding covetousness, because he was dealing with covetousness itself (7:7-9). This was the reason he was unsuccessful. In Romans 8, however, he declared in triumph that the law of the Spirit of life has overcome the law of sin and of death. He not only overcame the law of death, but the law of sin as well (vv. 1-2). Humanly speaking, sin is not the object of life's operation, but spiritually speaking, we counter evil with life, not with good. We cannot counter evil and sin with good because both evil and good are on the same side; they are products of the same tree. We cannot deal with one thing by using another thing of the same kind. The salvation in Christ has nothing to do with countering evil with good. Some have tried to counter pride with humility or rashness with meekness. This will never work.</p><p>On the one hand, the Lord died on the cross for the purpose of dealing with the frustration of the fall. On the other hand, He died for the purpose of dispensing His life to us. His death is not only the death of the Lamb for the accomplishment of redemption but the death of a grain of wheat for the producing of many grains (John 12:24). This death is not just a redemptive death but a death that multiplies itself into many grains. With the Lord there is the redemptive aspect of His death and there is the non-redemptive aspect of His death. The Lord said that His death was like a grain of wheat that fell into the earth and died. A grain of wheat does not have blood. Hence, the death of the grain is not for redemption but for the dispensing of life. The Lord has dealt with sin already. Today He wants us to live by His life. Therefore, we should not live in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; we have to live in the realm of the tree of life.</p><p>Whenever we are conscious that we are doing good or that we are doing evil, we have need of God's salvation. If we can tell both good and evil, we know that we are still living under the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because these are things from that tree. Of course, this does not mean that we should not do good. It means that God's life has entered into us and that we can live out this "good" spontaneously. What is the difference between the humility that flows from God's life and the humility that comes from us? Anything that we perform in ourselves is the result of good overcoming evil. We are very conscious of this overcoming. We may overcome a few times and after ten years still remember these experiences and testify about them. But these endeavors are from ourselves. They are things from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When a young brother or sister becomes conscious of his or her virtues before the Lord, we can tell that he or she is living in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p>Everything that God does within us is probably hidden from us; we do not know it, but anything that we do by ourselves is outward. Moses' face shone, but he did not know about it (Exo. 34:29). Today many people are conscious of their growth and their victory. I almost have to stomp my feet and shout, "You know too much! You know more than even God!" Those who are conscious that they are doing good are probably sunk in pride. When a man is touched by life, he will have nothing to be proud of. He will not know what is good and what is evil. He will only know God. Only the proud ones think that they know everything. Such ones are living in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God's goal is to deliver us from good and evil, as well as from the knowledge of good and evil. God wants to be our life within us. He wants us to be a channel of life and He wants to flow out of us. We do not know how this life works within us. We do not have to think about it or know about it. When God's life breaks out of us, it is spontaneous, like a new natural law operating within us.</p><p>May we not live in besetting sin but in God's eternal plan and the flow of His life. As long as we live in the flow of life, temper, rashness, pride, jealousy, etc., will all disappear. Spontaneously, we will be able to say with Paul, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (Rom. 8:2). We will be delivered from a life of feelings and move on to a life beyond feelings, from a life of knowledge to life itself. God is saving us from more than the things we inherited from Adam, that is, sin and death; He wants us to inherit what He has prepared for us&mdash;His own life.</p></body></html>
