   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the beginning of the seven years of the last week of the seventy weeks, Antichrist will make a firm covenant with Israel; and in the middle of the week he will break the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Daniel 9:27 says, "And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week; and in the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator, even until the complete destruction that is determined will be poured out upon the desolator."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Titus was a type of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He destroyed, devastated, the holy city and the holy temple, and Antichrist will do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Titus killed and persecuted the holy people, and Antichrist will do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Daniel's prophecy considers them as one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The person referred to in verse 27 is the prince in verse 26 who will destroy the city and the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That prince was Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But verse 27 refers to the coming Antichrist.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Replacing the Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>and Oblation with Abominations,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>i.e., Idols, of the Desolator, i.e., Antichrist</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will replace the sacrifice and oblation with abominations, idols, of the desolator, Antichrist Dan 12:11b; Matt 24:15; Rev 13:14-15; 2 Thes 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 24:15 the Lord speaks of "the abomination of desolation spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Revelation 13:14 and 15, the abomination of desolation is Antichrist's image, which is set up in the temple as an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then 2 Thessalonians 2:4 tells us that Antichrist will sit in the temple to claim that he is God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Daniel 9:27 refers to the "abominations plural of the desolator."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These abominations may refer to Antichrist himself, to his image, and to idols he puts into the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even until the Complete</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>upon the Desolator, i.e., Antichrist</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These idols will remain in the holy place, in the temple, even until the complete destruction that is determined will be poured out upon the desolator, that is, Antichrist Dan 9:27; 2 Thes 2:8; Rev 17:11; 19:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, the idols will remain in the temple for three and a half years until Antichrist is fully destroyed by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ will wipe him out with the appearing of His parousia, His coming.</S>
