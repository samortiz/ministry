 <h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE PROPER AUTHORITY<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church should function in this way, and the administration of any country should also function in this way. New measures are not produced by quarrels. In order for a new measure to become a law, the legislative body of a country must function appropriately and legally. Quarrels are not effective. We must learn this lesson. When a problem is before us, we should not express numerous different opinions. There is no need to quarrel in the church. Rather, we should build up the authority, the wall, to protect all the saints in the church. We must learn this lesson in order to do a serious work. Satan&rsquo;s stratagem is to damage God&rsquo;s building. For this reason, we should not encourage the atmosphere of freely expressing our opinions. Such an atmosphere will damage the church. We should not encourage fleshly activities or the expression of human opinions in the church. We should receive the dealing from the Lord and allow the Lord to build Himself into us.</p>
<p>The ones who have learned the lesson before the Lord and have been perfected know that there is order in the church. This does not mean that such ones are an authority; rather, they keep their position. If we have not learned the lesson and have not been built by God, our work will not be for the building. Those who are saved through us will be wild because we have not been built by God. Those whom we perfect will also be wild. We will not be able to build because we have not passed through the process of being built. Consequently, the Lord will have no way in us.</p>
<p>Today Christianity is chaotic. There are many opportunities for those who take the way of chaos. They can even establish a congregation at will. But those who desire to do the work of God&rsquo;s building need to learn serious lessons and see through the enemy&rsquo;s stratagems. This does not involve the truth. Our opinion may be correct, but we can still be persons who do not walk according to order, do not obey authority, and have not been dealt with. Because we have not learned the lesson, we will not know the church.</p>
<p>A brother responsible for a group meeting does not have the authority to decide something concerning the administration of the church. If the churches in Taiwan use large cups for the Lord&rsquo;s table, it is foolishness for a group meeting to change to small cups. This proves that we have not learned any lessons and do not know the church and the building. This shows that we are presumptuous and audacious persons. We must learn this serious lesson, and then we can do a serious work. Such a work will be valuable because it will be the building.</p>
<p>Building up authority does not mean building up our personal authority; rather, it means building up God&rsquo;s order in the church. When a person touches this authority, he will realize that this is the church and that God&rsquo;s order is here. God can have a way, and we will have a way. For hundreds of years many people have taken the way of Christianity. However, that is not God&rsquo;s way. May the Lord be gracious to us that we would know His building for the administration of the church and for the ministry of the word.</p>
