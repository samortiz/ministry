   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE MAJOR CONTENTS OF THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURAL WAY Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; Col 3:16; 1 Cor 14:4b; 1 Tim 1:3-4, 7; Col 2:2b; Eph 3:4 SPEAKING ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to see the major contents of the meetings according to the scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the contents of our meetings according to the God-ordained way must always be according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the approximately six thousand years of human history, human society has invented many cultural and philosophical things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christianity, including both Catholicism and Protestantism, has been on this earth as a religious system for nearly two thousand years and has picked up many pagan things from human society.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some of these things seem very good and seem very close to the teaching of the Bible, but they are not according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the cathedrals, chapels, and other meeting places in Christianity, many teachings are taught that are different from the apostles teaching concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since we practice meeting according to the truth of the Bible, we do not like to have only one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We desire to have all the saints learning to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some Christian groups do not like to have more than one speaker because to have one speaker is the most effective way to control their congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To them it is a great risk to allow everyone to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there are one thousand members and everyone speaks, a thousand different ideas and philosophies could come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To have every attendant speaking in all the meetings opens the door wide to any kind of false teaching, false doctrine, or heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apparently this is true, but we have the confidence that our meeting is not a meeting in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our meeting is a meeting of the saints who live in the spirit and only live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have the confidence that whenever saints like this come together, they would not speak anything other than what was taught by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 2:42 tells us that the three thousand saints who were saved on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word teaching in this verse is singular not plural, indicating that the apostles did not have many kinds of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They only had one kind of teaching, and this kind of teaching is the content of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostles teaching is concerning God s eternal economy, or dispensation, and we need to realize what this economy comprises.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Triune God has an eternal plan, an eternal economy, to get a people to be His corporate expression, and for Him to do this He has to be the very Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Christ was completed in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The completion of Christ involved the Triune God plus humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He became incarnated to bring the Triune God into humanity and to make humanity a vessel that He might be a man and might live on this earth to accomplish His all-inclusive redemption, that is, His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He came out of death in resurrection, and in resurrection this very Christ became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today this life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the planning Father, the accomplishing Son, and the applying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This wonderful One, this marvelous One, this excellent One, is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before His incarnation, the Trinity had not been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the processes of incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to the heavens, the Triune God has been consummated to be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit is the very embodiment and realization of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This dear One is the One in whom we believe, whom we worship as our God, and whom we take as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is this dear One who imparts life into us, who has regenerated us, and who is still sanctifying, transforming, and conforming us to His very Being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we received the Triune God, we became the Father s sons and the Son s brothers to be His Body for a corporate expression on this earth of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This expression is the church as the Body of the all-inclusive Christ, and this Body is the fullness of this wonderful One who fills all in all Eph 1:22b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These are the contents of God s economy, which is also the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that especially the young people will spend more time to get into all the details of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These things have to enter into your being, and you have to enter into these things in order to make these things one with your being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Week after week and year after year we teach people this divine economy based upon the sixty-six books of the Bible and even more upon the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that all of us would practice to spend time on two or three verses in the New Testament every morning for two or three years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Get these verses into you and get yourself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I advise not going to the Old Testament until you finish the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Labor day after day on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you get into these two or three verses, do not forget to get into their accompanying notes in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will help you to reach one goal, that is, the New Testament economy of God, which is the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The apostles teaching comprises the twenty-seven books of the New Testament in four main parts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first part of the New Testament was spoken by the Lord when He was in the flesh on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The second part was spoken by the Apostle Peter as a continuation of the Lord s word in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The third part was spoken by the Apostle Paul in portions of the Acts and in his fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fourth and final part of the speaking in the New Testament was given through the Apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Besides these four main parts of the New Testament, there are also James and Jude, but these dear saints did not have as important a role as the three apostles mentioned above in the composing of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, there are many different teachings, but these teachings are subordinate to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Foot washing is in John 13 and head covering is in 1 Corinthians 11, but subordinate things like these are not that crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person can lose a fingernail and still live, but if he loses his heart, he will lose his life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have said in the past that four short books composed by the Apostle Paul Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are the heart of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I noticed that many good Bible students and Bible scholars wore out these four books.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A good reader and student of the Bible will be one who wears out these four books.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The most worn-out part of the Bibles I have used is the part from Galatians through Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This part of our Bible should be worn out since these four books are the very heart of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because every meeting in our new practice of the church life is open to us, do not consider that this affords you a good opportunity to express your philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today on this earth, everyone has his philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Divorces are the result of the husbands philosophies and the wives philosophies conflicting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If all the wives and husbands would drop their philosophies, there would not be divorce or separation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Separations and divorces come through philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church has been divided today into thousands of divisions due to different philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A teaching is a philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Try not to bring your philosophy into the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You have to stick yourself to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Your teaching, your speaking, should be absolutely governed, limited, ruled, and controlled by the teaching of the apostles.</S>
