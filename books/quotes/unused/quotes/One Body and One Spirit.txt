Ephesians 4:3-4 says, 'Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit'
In order to understand them, we need to read and study the entire Bible, from its first page to its last chapter
These truths, along with nearly all the basic and intrinsic truths in the entire Bible, have been nearly lost among God's people
He has always worked in one way for one economy but He needs to be the Father the Son and the Spirit in order to carry out His one economy
According to the Bible, God will use four ages, four dispensations, to work in the old creation in order to produce the new creation
These four ages include the age before the law , the age after the law , the age of grace , and the kingdom age of one thousand years
He came to visit Abraham with the intention of rescuing Abraham's nephew Lot from His fiery judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah
The Gospel of Matthew opens with the genealogy of Christ, showing that Christ is the son of Abraham and the son of David
Although this is revealed in Matthew 1, today most Christians do not know the real significance of incarnation
Although the creation is very great, it cannot compare with incarnation because in incarnation God mingled Himself with man
The Triune God, the One who calls not being as being , one day entered into the womb of a young virgin and remained there for nine months
We call this a conception, but Matthew 1:20 says that it was a birth 'That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit'
Joseph her husband, being righteous and not willing to disgrace her openly, intended to send her away secretly
In the four Gospels there are many stories concerning Jesus from the time of His birth to the time of His crucifixion
In one sense, He was arrested and put to death, but in another sense, He handed Himself over to the Jewish leaders and the Roman government
The crucifixion He accomplished was unique in the fulfillment of God's unique purpose for God's unique economy
God stripped off and openly shamed the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it
If anyone has really seen the crucifixion, the all-inclusive death that Christ died on the cross, he will never create a division
In the crucifixion all the things of the old creation were terminated, including Satan, the world, sin, and all the negative things
At the time of His crucifixion He brought His human part, which was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, to the cross and terminated it
Christ Himself as the firstborn Son of God was the first item that needed to be germinated in His resurrection
Before His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God , but in resurrection He was born the firstborn Son of God
The one resurrection first germinated Jesus, who was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, to be born of God as the firstborn Son of God
Because the blood and flesh that Jesus put on in His incarnation were of the old creation, He put them on the cross
After His incarnation there was one man who was anointed by God to carry out God's eternal economy on this earth
Eventually, that division was moved out of Anaheim into a nearby city where a church had already been established
After appointing the elders in Ephesus , Paul visited the church in Ephesus and remained with the church once for three years
With these six items as the base, no one has any reason or any standing to make any division in the Body of Christ
The one Body of Christ is also the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God , constituted with all the members of Christ
There is still one federal government, one constitution, one diplomacy, one currency, one defense, one postal system, and one highway system
The concept of autonomy is awful because it makes the churches separate and some even divided from one another
We should not forget that all the believers are the one new man, and this one new man includes all the local churches
If we would all be in the oneness universally and in the one accord locally, the meeting halls of all the churches would be filled
We have been unaware of the fact that in the past five years the testimony of the recovery has been very much weakened
There may be fifteen churches in a particular region, but the question is whether or not they would be willing to be blended together
The local administration still exists, but in the spiritual element all the churches should be blended together as one
They could still meet in their own locality during the week, but on the Lord's Day they should come together to a central place
If a number of these small churches would come together they could have one hundred fifty in the meeting and this would bring in some impact
We still should keep the local administration in business affairs, but we have to learn to be blended with other churches
A new one may come to our meeting and be fully disappointed because our number is small or because our meeting place is a garage
Locally, we must be in one accord, without any opinion, and we must also keep the oneness in the universal Body
The apostle Paul blended the two churches in Colossae and Laodicea together as one by sending them epistles in common
Romans 16 shows us Paul's fellowship of the Body among the churches and the practical living of the Body of Christ in different localities
Whether the church in a certain locality should buy a piece of land in order to build a hall or not is a local affair
For the Lords move in His recovery both locally and universally we all need to be Bodyconscious in one accord and Bodycentered in oneness
The United States becomes the top country on this earth not because of the autonomy of its states but because of the unity of all the states
Jesus was glorified in His resurrection, and through His resurrection He as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit , that is, the Spirit
In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God never dwelt within anyone, but today He indwells every believer of Christ
In this one Spirit the allinclusive Spirit the believers in Christ were all baptized into one Body and were also given to drink one Spirit
The Spirit is the essence of the Body, the Lord is the element of the Body, and God the Father is the source of the Body
In 1 Timothy Paul charged Timothy to stay in Ephesus in order to charge certain ones not to teach different things but to teach Gods economy
The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of condemnation ; the New Testament ministry is of the Spirit and of righteousness
Although they are many, they have only one ministry the ministry of the new covenant for the accomplishing of God's New Testament economy
