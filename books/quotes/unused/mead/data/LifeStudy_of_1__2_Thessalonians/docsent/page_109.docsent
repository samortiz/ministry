   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEGREE OF OUR SALVATION AND THE EXTENT OF OUR SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The degree of our salvation depends on the extent of our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more we are sanctified, the more we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps yesterday you were further along on the bridge of salvation than you are today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason may be that you lost your temper with your husband or wife, and this caused you to move backwards somewhat on the bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You backslid and lost a little of your sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, you are not as sanctified now as you were yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose an old friend visits you and asks you to participate with him in a certain kind of worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you accept his invitation, you will lose even more sanctification and move back farther on the bridge of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if you refuse his invitation and instead preach the gospel to him and encourage him to become a Christian, you may recover the sanctification you have lost and even progress further on the bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, you are more sanctified and more saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The point here is that how much we have been saved is determined by how much we have been sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be impressed that God's salvation is not simple and that it is related to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose a young brother becomes weary of attending the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, one day instead of attending the meeting, he decides to go to the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The next time he comes to a meeting, he may feel that he is in death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason is that he has lost some of his sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not preserve his spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>SANCTIFICATION AND JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Martin Luther fought a great battle for the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because he was involved in this battle, we should not blame him for failing to see other aspects of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luther taught that justification is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to this, if we believe in the Lord, we shall be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, there is a sense in which justification is also a matter of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, the Bible speaks of justification before sanctification Rom 6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But on the other hand, there is a sense in which sanctification comes first and justification follows 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this sense, God's justification must go according to the standard of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are not sanctified, then we cannot be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE PROCESS OF GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's salvation of us involves a process.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It has a beginning, and it will have a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once again, we may use human life as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Life begins at birth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after birth there is a long process of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have been growing in human life for many years, and still I have not yet reached the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle is the same with God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, many Christians regard salvation in too simple a way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, in systematic theology salvation may be presented as if it were simple and clear cut.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But God's salvation is not simple, and in a certain sense it is not clear cut.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, it has a beginning, a process, and a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not even our human life is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why, then, should we expect God's full salvation to be so simple?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to have the proper concept concerning God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have the right understanding of this, we shall realize that the extent to which we are saved is determined by the degree we have been sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Paul's word in 2:13, salvation is in sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In our actual experience of God's salvation, we move back and forth on the bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps you yield to a certain temptation, and move backward on the bridge of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But even then the sanctifying Spirit is working in you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, that step backward may cause you to move even farther ahead than you were before.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, a brother may lose his temper with his wife and exchange words with her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No doubt, this failure causes him to move backward on the bridge of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, when he repents and returns to the Lord, he will once again move ahead, further than he was before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our experience none of us moves steadily ahead on the bridge of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the contrary, we all move ahead in the way of going backward and forward.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though this may not be clearly revealed as a doctrine in the Bible, we know from our experience that this is the way we advance on the bridge of God's salvation.</S>
