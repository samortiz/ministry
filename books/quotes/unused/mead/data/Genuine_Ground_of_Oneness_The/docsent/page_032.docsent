   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIGHT AND TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 43:3 says, "O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Light and truth are not two separate things; they are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, in the Gospel of John we have grace and truth, but in the First Epistle of John we have love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Truth is the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the light shines upon us, we receive the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, as we go to God in fellowship, we are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, on our end there is truth, but on God's end there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Psalm 43:3, we need both light and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse indicates that light and truth lead us and bring us to the Lord's holy hill and to His tabernacles, that is, to the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day by day, we are led by the light and the truth that come from the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 and 16 we see that the church, the house of the living God, is the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that truth is to be found in the church, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we have truth, we also have light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, both light and truth are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As this verse makes clear, light and truth have a specific and definite function: to bring us to the holy hill and to God's tabernacles, that is, to lead us to the place of God's choice and to His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today many Christians are seeking light and truth, but not many seek them for the purpose of being led to God's chosen place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if our purpose is to be brought to the holy hill and to God's dwelling place, light and truth will surely come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of us can testify that before we came into the church life, we received light and truth simply because we had begun to consider the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we had the thought of coming to the church, light and truth came to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when we were hesitant regarding the church, the light and truth seemed to disappear for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, when we realized that we must take the way of the church, light began to shine again, and truth appeared more fully than before.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then when we came into the church life, we were in the daylight and received much truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This testifies that light and truth have led us to God's holy hill and have brought us to God's dwelling place, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>PRESENTING OUR OFFERINGS TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us go on to Psalm 66.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 13 says, "I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 15 the psalmist goes on to say, "I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The psalmist realized that only in God's house, the temple, could he offer burnt offerings and sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He knew that only by going to the place of God's choice could he offer sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the type, we today must also go to the place of God's choice, the church, if we would present our offerings to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The children of Israel were required to go to the temple in order to present their offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God did not accept offerings in any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If an Israelite living in Dan had expressed the desire to offer something to God in Dan, the Lord would have said, "I cannot accept an offering presented to Me there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I accept offerings only at Mount Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God was not narrow, but He had chosen to make the temple the focal point of His attention.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had chosen Mount Zion as the unique place of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only in that place could His people present their offerings to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This principle applies in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many of us can testify that when we attempted to offer something to God outside the church, that offering was not very pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I dare not say that Christians cannot offer anything to God outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But I can testify that to do this apart from the church life is not altogether pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the type, our offerings should be presented at the unique place of God's choice.</S>
