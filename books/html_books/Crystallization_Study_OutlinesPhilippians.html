<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Living</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21a</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The subject and the controlling concept of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ&mdash;3:7-10; 4:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The experience of Christ is the master key which opens the book of Philippians to us.</li>
	<li>The experience of Christ is a Body matter&mdash;1:19; 2:1-2; 4:2-3, 10, 14-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Whatever is in the Body and of the Body involves mutual fellowship; the experience of Christ requires such mutuality&mdash;2:1-2; 1 Cor. 12:25.</li>
		<li>The experience of Christ must be in the Body and for the Body; only by experiencing Christ in the Body can we experience Him to the fullest extent&mdash; Eph. 4:16; Rom. 12:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The secret of experiencing Christ is to be one in soul, joined in soul, like-souled, with others&mdash;Phil. 1:27; 2:2, 19-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would experience Christ to the fullest extent in the Body, we need to be like-souled and we need to risk our soul&mdash;vv. 20, 30; Rom. 16:3-4.</li>
		<li>Because Timothy was like-souled with Paul, he was in the position to experience Christ to the uttermost in the Body, just as Paul was&mdash;Phil. 2:19-20; 1 Cor. 4:16-17; 16:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Philippians is a book not only on the experience of Christ but also on living Christ&mdash;1:19-21a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The basic thought of the Bible is that the Triune God desires to work Himself into us so that we may take Him as life and live Him&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into us and to work Himself into us as our life and life supply in order to live Him&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to have a group of people who are one with Him in His life and nature; those who are one with God in the divine life and nature are able to express Him&mdash;Eph. 3:19b, 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Christian life is a life of living Christ for the constitution and building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;4:1-3, 12, 16; Col. 1:24; 2:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christian life is to live Christ with His divine attributes expressed in His human virtues as a part of His organic Body&mdash;Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:14.</li>
		<li>For the Body, we should live a life that is Christ Himself, living as parts of His Body for the universal consummation of the eternal economy of God&mdash; Eph. 3:8-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Christian life is not a life of ethics, religion, culture, or even morality; the Christian life is Christ&mdash; Col. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As believers in Christ, we should live a life which is actually Christ Himself&mdash;John 6:57.</li>
		<li>The standard of the Christian life is Christ, and the normal experience of Christ is to live Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:20; Col. 2:2-3, 8; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s life was to live Christ&mdash;v. 21a; Gal. 2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ lived within Paul as his life, and Paul lived Christ without as His living; they lived together as one person with one life and one living.</li>
		<li>When we live Christ, Christ and we live together: two lives have one living, two natures are mingled into one nature, and two spirits become one spirit&mdash; John 6:57; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would live Christ, we need to realize who Christ is and what Christ is and also realize that He is subjective as well as objective&mdash;Col. 2:9; 1:27; 3:1.</li>
	<li>We live Christ in the organic union with Him&mdash;Rom. 12:5; John 15:4a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To believe in Christ is to have our being merged into His that the two may be organically one&mdash;Phil. 1:29.</li>
		<li>In the organic union we are intimate with Christ; we are one spirit with Him that we may live Him&mdash; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to live Christ, we must take Him as our person and as our life&mdash;Eph. 3:17a; Col. 3:4.</li>
	<li>To live Christ requires that we remain in the inward parts of Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul experienced the inward parts of Christ; he was one with Christ in His inward parts in longing after the saints.</li>
		<li>Paul did not live a life in his natural inner being; he lived a life in the inward parts of Christ.</li>
		<li>If we would be those who are in Christ, we must be in His inward parts, in His tender and delicate feelings&mdash;John 15:4a.</li>
		<li>To live Christ is to abide in His inward parts and there to enjoy Him as grace&mdash;Phil. 1:7; 4:23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is mysterious, and those who live Him also are mysterious&mdash;Col. 1:27; 2:2; 1 John 3:1.</li>
	<li>To live Christ means that, no matter what our circumstances may be, Christ is magnified in us and that we are not put to shame in anything&mdash;Phil. 1:20a; 1 John 2:28.</li>
	<li>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ was for Paul to live Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit includes divinity, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, the divine attributes, and the human virtues&mdash;Acts 16:7; Rom. 8:9.</li>
		<li>In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of the supply of the Body before speaking of the bountiful supply of the Spirit because the Spirit is upon the Body:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As a member of the Body, Paul realized that he needed the supply of the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12, 14-22.</li>
			<li>Paul had the clear sense within that he was in the Body, that the members of the Body were supporting him, and that the bountiful supply of the Spirit would come to him through the Body.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Paul could be an overcomer because he experienced and enjoyed the all-inclusive Spirit with His bountiful supply dwelling in him to be everything to him&mdash; Rom. 8:37.</li>
		</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Expression</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-26; 4:22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>All of Paul&rsquo;s life and work were not for expressing himself or for displaying his knowledge, his ability, or his other merits and strong points; what he was and what he did were for expressing Christ, even for magnifying Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:20; cf. 3:3-10; 4:22.</li>
<li>In the apostle&rsquo;s suffering in his body, Christ was magnified; that is, He was shown or declared to be great (without limitation), exalted, and extolled&mdash; 1:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The apostle&rsquo;s sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness&mdash;Acts 9:16; 2 Cor. 6:4; 11:23; Col. 1:24.</li>
	<li>To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment&mdash;Phil. 1:18; 4:23.</li>
	<li>As Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him to appear great in the eyes of his captors:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Regardless of the circumstances, Paul was full of joy and rejoicing in the Lord&mdash;cf. Acts 16:23-25.</li>
		<li>Since Philippians is concerned with the experience and enjoyment of Christ, which issue in joy, it is a book filled with joy and rejoicing&mdash;1:4, 18, 25; 2:2, 17-18, 28-29; 3:1; 4:1, 4.</li>
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s shining forth and expressing Christ in his joy were a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ and a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible&mdash;Eph. 3:8; cf. Isa. 9:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Salvation in Philippians 1:19 means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ; this requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The salvation Paul speaks of in 1:19 is not eternal salvation; it is a subjective, experiential, and constant salvation in our daily life for magnifying Christ.</li>
	<li>To live Christ for His magnification is to participate in Christ&rsquo;s salvation in life, in which we are saved from the failure of not living Christ and from the defeat of not magnifying Christ&mdash;Rom. 5:10.</li>
	<li>The key to Paul&rsquo;s experience of salvation was the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; when we enjoy the Spirit and partake of Him, Christ is magnified and becomes our expression&mdash;Heb. 1:9b; 3:14a; 6:4b; 1 Cor. 12:3b.</li>
	<li>We need to be in the Body life and remain in the priestly service that builds up the Body so that we can enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the supply of the Body, for magnifying Christ&mdash;Psa. 133:2; Exo. 30:23-31; Phil. 1:19; Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The expression of Christ, signified by the priestly garments, qualifies us to serve as priests and sanctifies us, separates us unto God for His unique purpose&mdash; Exo. 28:2-4; 1 Pet. 2:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The expression of Christ as our &ldquo;holy garments&rdquo; is for glory and for beauty&mdash;Exo. 28:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>For glory</em> means to express Christ&rsquo;s divinity with the divine attributes&mdash;John 1:14; Heb. 1:3; John 17:22; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li><em>For beauty</em> means to express Christ&rsquo;s humanity with the human virtues&mdash;Luke 24:19; Acts 16:7; Psa. 27:4.</li>
		<li>Whenever we express the divine glory blended with the beauty of human virtues, we are built up together as the priesthood&mdash;1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
		<li>Whenever we are separated from the other saints and become individualistic, we immediately express the fallen, natural life instead of expressing Christ with the divine glory and the human beauty.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the believers&rsquo; pattern, Paul lived a life fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes, a life that resembled the one that the Lord Himself had lived on the earth years before&mdash;1 Tim. 1:16; Gal. 6:17; cf. Acts 27:21-26.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we magnify Christ by living Him, we will become strong factors, channels of supply, to enable the saints to grow in life and enjoy the Lord&mdash;Phil. 1:22-26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Paul&rsquo;s chained body, Christ was exalted, extolled, praised, and appreciated because Paul lived Christ&mdash; v. 21; Eph. 6:20.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being magnified is so that He may be seen by others in the reality of His resurrection and ministered to others in the reality of His Spirit.</li>
	<li>When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he was living in prison and not outwardly working; his speaking of &ldquo;fruit for my work&rdquo; indicates that his work was actually his living&mdash;Phil. 1:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fruit of this work was Christ lived out, magnified, ministered, and transfused into others.</li>
		<li>The fruit of this work was the issue, the result, of Paul&rsquo;s living in prison.</li>
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s living work was to minister Christ to others and to transfuse the Christ he magnified into them.</li>
		<li>Through Paul&rsquo;s magnification of Christ, even some in Caesar&rsquo;s household were saved&mdash;4:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because of Paul the churches could have the growth in life and could be filled with the enjoyment of Christ; this should also be true of us today&mdash;1:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because Paul lived and magnified Christ to the uttermost, he could transfuse Christ into the saints and minister Christ to all the churches.</li>
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s consideration to either depart and be with Christ or remain in the flesh was not selfish but was for the saints&rsquo; sake; he was absolutely occupied by the Lord and the church&mdash;vv. 23-24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It should matter to the church whether we remain or go to be with the Lord, but this depends on our living Christ, magnifying Christ, ministering Christ, and transfusing Christ from the depths of our being into that of the saints&mdash; cf. 2:25-30.</li>
			<li>In the Body life there is the urgent need of certain ones to function as channels of supply&mdash; cf. Zech. 4:12-14; Judg. 9:9.</li>
			</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Pattern</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:5-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In order to experience Christ and live Christ, we must know Him as our pattern and take Him as our pattern:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 2:5-11 Paul presents Christ as the pattern; we need to have this pattern infused into us.</li>
	<li>The pattern of the Christian life is the God-man Savior who emptied Himself and humbled Himself and who has been exalted and glorified by God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped and retained; He emptied Himself, laying aside what He possessed&mdash;the form of God&mdash; vv. 6-7a.</li>
		<li>In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature; He changed only His outward expression from the form of God to the form of a slave.</li>
		<li>The Lord became &ldquo;in the likeness of men&rdquo;&mdash; vv. 7b-8a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ&rsquo;s deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity.</li>
			<li>He appeared to men as a man outwardly, but as God He had the reality of deity inwardly.</li>
			<li>Christ entered into the condition of humanity, and He was found in fashion as a man.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ humbled Himself by becoming obedient even unto death&mdash;the death of a cross&mdash;v. 8b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Humbling Himself was a further step in emptying Himself.</li>
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s self-humbling manifested His self-emptying.</li>
			<li>The death of a cross was the climax of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Lord humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak and bestowed on Him &ldquo;the name which is above every name&rdquo;&mdash; v. 9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God has exalted Jesus, a real man, to be the Lord of all&mdash;Acts 2:32-33; 5:31.</li>
			<li>This exaltation of Christ was the manifestation of resurrection power.</li>
			<li>The highest name in the universe, the greatest name, is the name of Jesus:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The name is the expression of the sum total of what the Lord Jesus is in His person and work.</li>
				<li>2) <em>In the name of Jesus</em> means in the sphere and element of all that the Lord is&mdash;Phil. 2:10.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The result of our confessing that Jesus is Lord is that God the Father is glorified; this is the great end of all that Christ is and has done in His person and work&mdash;v. 11; 1 Cor. 15:24-28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The principle of this pattern is that someone with the highest life and position would be willing to live in a lowly way.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as our pattern is not only objective but also subjective and experiential&mdash;Phil. 2:5, 12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The One who set up the pattern and who Himself is the pattern is now operating within us as the indwelling God&mdash;v. 13.</li>
	<li>The principle of Christ as the inward pattern for our living is that even if we have the highest standard or the highest position, we should not grasp it.</li>
	<li>We need to be partners with Christ in His human living, especially in His emptying and humbling Himself and in His not grasping equality with God as a treasure&mdash;vv. 6-7.</li>
	<li>The Christ who is our pattern is now the life within us&mdash;Col. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have a life in us that is a self-emptying and self-humbling life; this life never grasps at something as a treasure but is always willing to lay aside position and title.</li>
		<li>We have Christ crucified as our pattern, and this pattern is the crucified life within us&mdash;Gal. 2:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The steps of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation in Philippians 2:5-8 are all aspects of the crucified life lived out in a full way.</li>
			<li>When we live Christ, we live the One who is the pattern of a crucified life&mdash;1:21a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Taking the crucified life as our pattern opens the gate of resurrection and brings us into the power of resurrection&mdash;3:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By living a crucified life, we can experience the power of resurrection which exalted Christ to the highest peak in the universe&mdash;Eph. 1:19-22.</li>
			<li>The highest life on earth is a crucified life; whenever we live a crucified life, God will bring us into resurrection.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ should be exalted not only objectively in the universe but also subjectively in our daily life&mdash; Phil. 2:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is exalted in us as we take Him as the crucified life to be the pattern of our daily life.</li>
			<li>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the power that exalts Christ&mdash;1:19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we would take Christ as our pattern, we need to take Christ&rsquo;s mind as our mind&mdash;2:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul not only took Christ as his living and expression outwardly but also took the mind of Christ as his mind inwardly.</li>
	<li>For the mind of Christ to be in us means that this mind is something living; actually, the mind of Christ is Christ Himself, for the person of Christ is manifested in His mind.</li>
	<li>We need to open ourselves and let &ldquo;this mind&rdquo; be in us&mdash;v. 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>This</em> refers to the considering in verse 3 and to the regarding in verse 4.</li>
		<li>This kind of thinking was in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man&mdash;vv. 7-8.</li>
		<li>To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts&mdash;1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Constant Salvation</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:12-16</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The salvation in Philippians 2:12 is not eternal salvation from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from the lake of fire but the daily and constant salvation that is Christ as a living Person:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This practical, daily, moment-by-moment salvation results from taking the very Christ whom we live, experience, and enjoy as our inward as well as outward pattern:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The main elements of this salvation are Christ as the crucified life (vv. 5-8) and Christ in His exaltation (vv. 9-11).</li>
		<li>When this pattern becomes our inward life, the pattern becomes our salvation.</li>
		<li>To work out our salvation is to work out this pattern and to become in experience a reprint of this pattern&mdash;cf. 1 Pet. 2:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The constant salvation in Philippians 1:19 is one in which a particular believer is saved from a specific encounter in a particular situation; whereas the constant salvation in 2:12 is one in which any believer is saved from ordinary things in common situations in his daily living.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To work out our own salvation is to carry it out, to bring it to the ultimate conclusion&mdash;v. 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We have received God&rsquo;s salvation, which has as its climax our being exalted by God in glory as the Lord Jesus was&mdash;v. 9.</li>
	<li>Now we need to carry out this salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with the inward motive of fear and the outward attitude of trembling&mdash;v. 12, cf. v. 8; 1 Sam. 15:22.</li>
	<li>The inner operating God Himself is our salvation, and obedience to Him is the working out of our salvation&mdash;Phil. 2:12-13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reason we need to obey always is that God operates in us&mdash;v. 13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It is not that we by ourselves carry out our salvation, but that God operates in us to do it; the only thing we need to do is to obey the inner operating, energizing God&mdash;cf. Col. 1:29.</li>
	<li>The God who operates in us as our subjective salvation is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash; the very God who is Christ in us (2 Cor. 13:3a, 5) and the Spirit in us (Rom. 8:11).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God operates in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The willing is within; the working is without.</li>
	<li>The willing takes place in our will, indicating that God&rsquo;s operation begins from our spirit and spreads into our mind, emotion, will, and eventually into our physical body&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 6, 11.</li>
	<li>The good pleasure of God&rsquo;s will (Eph. 1:5) is to operate in us so that we may reach the climax of His supreme salvation&mdash;cf. Rom. 5:10, 17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Murmurings and reasonings frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent and from experiencing and enjoying Christ to the uttermost&mdash; Phil. 2:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Murmurings are of our emotion and come mainly from the sisters; reasonings are of our mind and come mainly from the brothers.</li>
	<li>Murmurings and reasonings are due to disobedience to God; obedience to God slays all murmurings and reasonings.</li>
	<li>We should do all things without murmurings and reasonings in order that we may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish&mdash;v. 15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Blameless</em> describes our outward behavior, and <em>guileless</em> our inward character; to be guileless is to be simple, artless (not political), or innocent&mdash;Matt. 10:16.</li>
		<li>As children of God, we have God&rsquo;s life and nature&mdash; John 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the midst of the dark and corrupt world, which is usurped by Satan (1 John 5:19; 2:15-17), our function is to shine as luminaries, holding forth the word of life&mdash;Phil. 2:15-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the sun, with the church as the moon and the believers as the planets to reflect Him by holding forth the word of life.</li>
	<li>To hold forth the word of life is to apply it, to present it, and to offer it to the world by living out Christ&mdash; Acts 5:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Philippians 2:12-16 is a definition of living Christ in 1:19-21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The God who operates in us (2:13) is the supplying Spirit (1:19).</li>
	<li>To shine as luminaries (2:15) is to magnify Christ (1:20), and to hold forth the word of life (2:16) is to live Christ (1:21a).</li>
	<li>The only way to live Christ is to be saturated with the word of life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word of life is the living breath of God (2 Tim. 3:16), the Spirit who gives life (John 6:63).</li>
		<li>We need to pray-read the Word, receiving the word of God by means of all prayer and petition&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
		<li>We need to sing-read the Word, letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom by singing&mdash; Col. 3:16.</li>
		<li>If we are filled with the riches of the living word day by day, spontaneously we shall hold forth the word of life; this is to live Christ that He may be magnified in us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Philippians 2:5-16 reveals the divine and rich provision for our constant salvation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We have the Lord Jesus as our pattern&mdash;vv. 5-11.</li>
	<li>We have God operating in us&mdash;v. 13.</li>
	<li>We are God&rsquo;s children, having God&rsquo;s life and the divine nature&mdash;v. 15.</li>
	<li>We are luminaries qualified to reflect the divine light of Christ&mdash;v. 15.</li>
	<li>We have the word of life to hold forth, to present, to others&mdash;v. 16.</li>

		<li>Christ poured out His being unto God&mdash;Isa. 53:12.</li>
		<li>Christ is the heavenly, spiritual wine poured out to God for His pleasure; He poured Himself out as wine to make God happy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The vine depicts the sacrificing Christ, the Christ who sacrificed everything of Himself, and out of His sacrifice He produced new wine to cheer God and man&mdash; Judg. 9:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the wine-producer, sacrificing Himself to produce wine to cheer God and others.</li>
		<li>If we contact this Christ and experience His sacrificing life, He will energize us to live a life of sacrifice, producing wine to make others and the Lord happy&mdash;2 Cor. 1:24b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The drink offering typifies not only Christ Himself but also the Christ who saturates us with Himself as heavenly wine until He and we become one to be poured out for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and satisfaction and for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Matt. 9:17; Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The drink offering is a type of Christ as the heavenly wine who is enjoyed by the offerer, filling him and causing him to become wine to God&mdash;Phil. 2:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By experiencing Christ as the offerings, we become persons who are filled and saturated with Christ&mdash; Eph. 3:17; Gal. 4:19.</li>
		<li>The Christ whom we experience subjectively as the offerings becomes wine in us, causing us to be ecstatically happy and joyful&mdash;Matt. 9:17; 2 Cor. 5:13a.</li>
		<li>Eventually, we are saturated with Christ as the heavenly wine and are one with the wine and even become wine; in this way we are qualified to be a drink offering&mdash;Matt. 9:17; 2 Cor. 5:13a; Eph. 5:2; Phil. 2:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The drink offering is our subjective experience of being made one with the Lord to such an extent that He becomes us.</li>
			<li>The more we experience Christ as the offerings, the more of a drink offering we become&mdash;Num. 15:1-10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Jacob poured out a drink offering on the pillar at Bethel, indicating that the drink offering is for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Gen. 35:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The wine poured out at Bethel is not the direct wine from the winepress; it is the indirect wine from those who enjoy Christ as wine and who are saturated with Christ as wine.</li>
		<li>In Bethel, in God&rsquo;s house, the church, we need to be poured out as a drink offering&mdash;2 Cor. 12:15a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In order to have the drink offering poured out on the pillar, we must have the genuine building&mdash;Eph. 2:22.</li>
			<li>Wherever there is the drink offering, there is also the pillar set up as the house of God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The apostle Paul became a drink offering that was poured out upon the sacrifice and service of the saints&rsquo; faith&mdash;Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The wine of the drink offering in Philippians 2:17 and 2 Timothy 4:6 is the Christ (wine) of Matthew 9:17 who had saturated Paul and had made him wine.</li>
	<li>Paul became a drink offering for the church; this indicates that the drink offering is not only for the worship of God but especially for God&rsquo;s building.</li>
	<li>Based upon the principle that the drink offering required a basic offering, Paul regarded the sacrifice and service of the believers&rsquo; faith as the basic offering upon which he could pour out himself as a drink offering&mdash;Phil. 2:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faith here includes all that the believers have experienced and enjoyed of Christ; ultimately, it includes what the believers themselves are:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The faith which can be offered to God as a sacrifice is a constitution of our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</li>
			<li>When we experience and enjoy Christ as the basic offerings, this experience and enjoyment becomes our faith.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The basic offering upon which Paul could pour himself out as a drink offering was the faith of the believers in Philippi:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It is the believers&rsquo; faith, not the believers themselves, which is a sacrifice.</li>
			<li>Faith, the word, and the Spirit are one&mdash;Rom. 10:17; 8:9:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Faith is both the issue of the word and the function of the Spirit.</li>
				<li>2) Whenever there is genuine faith in us, the word is implied, and the Spirit is realized.</li>
				<li>3) Faith is the result of the word and the Spirit mingled with our appreciation of Christ.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>With genuine faith, there are both the enjoyment of faith and the sacrifice of faith.</li>
			<li>Faith in Philippians 2:17 is the sum total of our experience, enjoyment, and gain of Christ:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Our experience, enjoyment, and gain of Christ become a sweet sacrifice offered to God.</li>
				<li>2) Through the enjoyment of Christ, we experience Christ, gain Christ, and possess Christ, and our being is constituted of Christ; in this way our faith becomes a sacrifice which can be offered to God and upon which the drink offering can be poured.</li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Lived-out Righteousness</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:9; Luke 15:22-23; Psa. 45:13-14a</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In experiencing Christ, Paul was found by others to be a man in Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul had been altogether in the Jewish religion under the law and had always been found by others in the law, but at his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ and became &ldquo;a man in Christ&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 12:2.</li>
	<li>Now he expected to be found in Christ by all who observed him&mdash;the Jews, the angels, and the demons; this indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in and saturated with Christ that all who observed him might find him fully in Christ.</li>
	<li>Only when we are found in Christ, will Christ be expressed and magnified&mdash;Phil. 1:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul wanted to be found in Christ in the condition of the righteousness of God, taking Christ as his subjective, lived-out righteousness&mdash;3:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There are two aspects of Christ being righteousness to the believers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first aspect&mdash;to be the believers&rsquo; righteousness for them to be justified before God objectively at the time of their repenting unto God and believing into Christ&mdash;Rom. 3:24-26; Acts 13:39; Gal. 3:24b, 27.</li>
		<li>The second aspect&mdash;to be the believers&rsquo; righteousness lived out of them as the manifestation of God, who is the righteousness in Christ given to the believers for them to be justified by God subjectively&mdash;Rom. 4:25; 1 Pet. 2:24a; James 2:24; Matt. 5:20; Rev. 19:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>These two aspects are typified by the best robe and the fattened calf in Luke 15:22-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The best robe typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness given to the believers to cover them outwardly before God as their objective righteousness.</li>
		<li>The fattened calf typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness given to the believers as their life supply for them to live out God in Christ as their subjective righteousness.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>These two aspects are also typified by the two garments of the queen in Psalm 45:13-14a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>One garment corresponds with the objective righteousness, which is for our salvation&mdash;&ldquo;Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold&rdquo;&mdash;v. 13b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This signifies that the Christ who has been dealt with through death and resurrection is the righteousness of the church to meet the righteous requirement of God for her to be justified by God&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Luke 15:22; Jer. 23:6.</li>
			<li>Her being covered with gold signifies the church&rsquo;s appearing in the divine nature&mdash;Psa. 45:9b; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The other garment corresponds with the subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory&mdash;&ldquo;She will be led to the King in embroidered clothing&rdquo;&mdash; Psa. 45:14a; cf. Rev. 19:8; Matt. 22:11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The overcoming believers are Christ&rsquo;s corporate queen, taking Christ as their royal abode for them to be found in Christ and for Him to become their subjective righteousness&mdash;Psa. 45:13a; John 15:4a.</li>
			<li>This embroidered clothing, another garment, the second layer of her covering, signifies that the church will be led to Christ at their marriage clothed with the righteousnesses of the saints to meet the requirement of Christ for her marriage&mdash;Rev. 19:8.</li>
			<li>The raiment of embroidered work is the subjective Christ woven into our character, embroidered into our being, to be our lived-out righteousness.</li>
			<li>This embroidery signifies the transforming work of the Holy Spirit, who is working day by day to embroider Christ into us stitch by stitch to be our wedding garment.</li>
			<li>The degraded recovered church needs to pay the price to live Christ as her subjective righteousness that she may be clothed with Christ as her God-approved conduct&mdash;3:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The subjective righteousness of God in Philippians 3:9 is actually God Himself becoming our daily living, a living which is right with God and man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul did not want to live in his own righteousness, the righteousness which comes from man&rsquo;s own effort to keep the law&mdash;vv. 6, 9.</li>
		<li>Our own righteousness is the expression of ourselves, the living out of ourselves.</li>
		<li>Paul desired to live in the righteousness of God and to be found in such a transcendent condition, expressing God by living Christ, not by keeping the law&mdash;cf. Matt. 5:20.</li>
		<li>The living which is right with both God and man must be God as our expression in our daily living, God Himself lived out through us.</li>
		<li>If we are to be found in Christ, we must be in such a condition that God is expressed through us and becomes our daily living.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Faith is the basis, the condition, on which we receive and possess the righteousness that is out of God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ&mdash; Phil. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1:30:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ Himself, who is infused into us through our appreciation of Him, becomes our faith&mdash;the faith in Him&mdash;Heb. 12:2a; 2 Pet. 1:1; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li>When we experientially have the supply of the Spirit (Phil. 1:19) through the word of life (2:16) issuing in the faith of Christ (3:9), we are infused with God Himself&mdash;Rom. 10:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Then the very God who has been infused into us becomes our daily living, the living which Paul describes as the righteousness of God.</li>
		<li>This is to be found in Christ under the condition of enjoying God&rsquo;s infusion that we may live Him out through the supply of the Spirit, the word of life, and the righteousness of God through faith.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:4-14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Chapter three of Philippians shows us that Christ must be our goal and our aim&mdash;vv. 12-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>For Christ to be the goal means that He is the highest enjoyment.</li>
	<li>Our goal is the all-inclusive Christ as the prize to be awarded to us; when we reach the goal, the goal will immediately become the prize&mdash;v. 14.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s pursuit was toward one goal, one aim&mdash;Christ; he took Christ as his goal, pursuing to obtain the prize to which God in Christ Jesus had called him upward.</li>
	<li>Since our goal is to gain Christ, we should forsake all other things and pursue nothing but Christ&mdash;vv. 7-8, 12-14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Saul of Tarsus had a vision of the Lord Jesus; this vision gave him the excellency of the knowledge of Christ&mdash;Acts 9:1-5; 22:6-11; 26:13-16; Gal. 1:15a, 16a; Phil. 3:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It is important for us to realize that in Philippians 3:8 Paul does not speak directly of the excellency of Christ but speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This knowledge is not the knowledge that belongs to Christ, the knowledge that Christ Himself has; it is our subjective knowing of Christ.</li>
		<li>In verse 8 <em>knowledge</em> actually means a revelation, a vision, concerning Christ and His excellence.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His person&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Col. 1:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The entire Bible is a revelation of the wonderful person of Christ; how excellent and inexhaustible He is!</li>
		<li>When Christ was revealed to Paul, he saw that the excellency, the super-eminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law&mdash;Gal. 1:15a, 16a.</li>
		<li>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is the excellency of Christ realized by us.</li>
		<li>If we lack the knowledge of Christ&rsquo;s excellency, His excellency will not mean anything to us.</li>
		<li>Christ is unlimited; we need to have the excellency of the knowledge of the unlimited Christ&mdash;Col. 1:12, 15-19; 2:2-3, 9, 16-17; 3:10.</li>
		<li>We need to have a vision of the preciousness of Christ&mdash;1 Pet. 2:4, 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ comes by revelation&mdash;Matt. 16:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Without the revelation concerning Christ, we would not know Christ; revelation is for knowing&mdash;11:27; Gal. 1:15a, 16a.</li>
		<li>We need to see a vision and receive a revelation of the excellency of Christ; if we have a revelation of Christ&rsquo;s excellency, we shall automatically have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to experience Christ, we first need to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:7-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To know Christ is crucial to our experience of Him; we cannot experience Him without knowing Him&mdash; Gal. 1:15a, 16a; 2:20; 4:19.</li>
		<li>Our experience of Christ cannot surpass the excellency of our knowledge of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:17-21; 3:14-19:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ always exceeds our experience of Christ.</li>
			<li>There has never been a believer whose experience of Christ surpassed his knowledge of Christ.</li>
			<li>If we do not have a higher knowledge of Christ, we cannot have a higher experience of Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>On account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, Paul counted all things to be loss, and he suffered the loss of all things, counting them as refuse that he might gain Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:7-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s eyes were opened to see the excellency of the knowledge of the wonderful, all-inclusive Christ; on account of this excellency, he counted as loss all things, whether they related to religious gain or natural gain:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All things which were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in Christ and enjoying Him:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In verse 7 <em>what things</em> refers to the religious things, the things in Judaism; Paul dropped all those religious things for Christ&mdash;vv. 4-6.</li>
			<li>In verse 8 <em>all things</em> indicates that Paul dropped not only religious things but all things on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus; thus, to Paul, the loss of all things was the loss not only of his Jewish status but of everything.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Paul placed great value upon the excellency of the knowledge of his dear Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;vv. 7-8.</li>
		<li>For the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, which he treasured, Paul counted everything as refuse, dregs, rubbish, filth, that which is thrown to the dogs&mdash;v. 8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The way for us to experience Christ and enjoy Christ is to deny everything we have and are&mdash;vv. 4-6, 13b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The greatest obstacle to enjoying Christ is our natural heritage:

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Paul aspired to know Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ in Philippians 3:8 is by revelation, but to know Him in verse 10 is by experience.</li>
	<li>Paul first received the revelation of Christ, then sought the experience of Christ&mdash;to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way.</li>
	<li><em>The one thing</em> in the book of Philippians is the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ&mdash;2:2; cf. 1:20-21; 2:5; 3:7-9; 4:12-13.</li>
	<li>To know Christ is not merely to have the knowledge concerning Him but to gain His very person&mdash;2 Cor. 2:10; cf. Col. 2:9, 16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To gain something requires the paying of a price; to gain Christ is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of all His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8) by paying a price.</li>
		<li>Christ has gained us, taken possession of us, that we might gain Him, take possession of Him&mdash;Phil. 3:12.</li>
		<li>The Christian life is a life of gaining Christ in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages&mdash; incarnation, inclusion, and intensification&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Even though Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, he did not consider that he had experienced Him in full or gained Him to the uttermost; for this reason he was still advancing toward the goal&mdash;the gaining of Christ to the fullest extent&mdash;Phil. 3:12-14.</li>
			<li>In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, Paul not only forsook his experiences in Judaism but also would not linger in his past experiences of Christ and be limited by them; he forgot the past&mdash;v. 13.</li>
			<li>Not to forget but to linger in our past experiences, however genuine they were, frustrates our further pursuing of Christ&mdash;v. 13; Heb. 6:1a.</li>
			<li>Christ is unsearchably rich, and there is a vast territory of His riches to be possessed; Paul was stretching out to reach the farthest extent of this territory&mdash;Phil. 3:13.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul aspired to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;v. 10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is His resurrection life, which raised Him from the dead&mdash;Eph. 1:19-20.</li>
	<li>The Spirit is the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and its power&mdash;Rom. 8:9-11; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 John 5:6.</li>
	<li>The Spirit compounded with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and its power (Phil. 1:19; Exo. 30:23-25) indwells our spirit (Rom. 8:10-11) to dispense Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and its power not only to our spirit and soul (vv. 6b, 10) but also to our mortal body (vv. 11, 13b; 2 Cor. 4:11).</li>
	<li>We should cooperate with the resurrecting Spirit to recognize that we have been resurrected with Christ (Col. 2:12; Eph. 2:6a) and to pursue the power of the resurrection of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is by this power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, determine to take the cross by denying our self&mdash;Matt. 16:24; cf. S. S. 2:8-9.</li>
		<li>It is also by this power of resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, are enabled to be conformed to His death, to be one with His cross&mdash;Phil. 3:10; cf. S. S. 2:14-15.</li>
		<li>In order to experience the life-giving Spirit as the reality of the flourishing riches of the resurrection of Christ, we have to discern our spirit from our soul&mdash;Heb. 4:12; cf. S. S. 2:14-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power in the life-giving Spirit is the sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;2 Cor. 12:9; 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:10, 45b, 58; cf. Exo. 3:2-6, 14-15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul aspired to know the fellowship of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings&mdash;Phil. 3:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection; with us, the power of His resurrection comes first, followed by the participation in His sufferings and conformity to His death.</li>
	<li>We first receive the power of His resurrection; then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s sufferings are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which were completed by Christ Himself, and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers&mdash;Col. 1:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We cannot participate in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings for redemption, but we must take part in the sufferings of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body&mdash;cf. Rev. 1:9; 2 Tim. 2:10; 2 Cor. 1:5-6; 4:12; 6:8-11.</li>
		<li>Christ as the Lamb of God suffered for redemption (John 1:29); Christ as the grain of wheat suffered for reproducing and building (12:24):

				<li>3) The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory; it is by the death of the cross&mdash;vv. 20-24.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:10-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In Philippians 3:10 Paul spoke of &ldquo;being conformed to His death&rdquo;; this expression indicates that Paul desired to take Christ&rsquo;s death as the mold of his life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ, counting all things as loss, gaining Christ, being found in Him, knowing Him, knowing the power of His resurrection, and knowing the fellowship of His sufferings all issue in one thing&mdash;being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death&mdash; vv. 7-10.</li>
	<li>Being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is the base of the experience of Christ&mdash;1:20-21a; 3:9-10.</li>
	<li>The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to the continual putting to death of His natural, human life that He might live by the life of God&mdash;John 6:57a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a crucified life; by living a crucified life He was alive to God and lived Him.</li>
		<li>He always put His human life to death so that the divine life within Him could flow out&mdash;10:10b-11, 17.</li>
		<li>As He was living, He was also dying&mdash;dying to the old creation in order to live a life in the new creation; this is the meaning of &ldquo;His death&rdquo; in Philippians 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s death is a mold to which we are conformed in much the same way that dough is put into a cake mold and conformed to it:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God has put us into the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death, and day by day God is molding us to conform us to this death&mdash;Rom. 6:3-4.</li>
		<li>Our life should be conformed to such a mold&mdash;dying to our human life in order to live the divine life&mdash; Gal. 2:20; 2 Cor. 4:10-11.</li>
		<li>If we put to death our natural life, we shall have the consciousness that we have another life, the divine life, within us; this life will be released, and then in our experience we shall be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death&mdash;John 10:10b; 1 John 5:11-12.</li>
		<li>In the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death the natural man is killed, the old man is crucified, and the self is nullified&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 6:6; Matt. 16:24.</li>
		<li>If we allow our circumstances to press us into this mold, our daily life will be molded into the form of Christ&rsquo;s death&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
		<li>We are conformed to the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Phil. 3:10; John 11:25; Eph. 1:19-20; S. S. 2:8-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, we experience His all-accomplishing death:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By being conformed to His death, we experience Christ in His death for the release, impartation, and multiplication of life&mdash;John 12:24-26; 2 Cor. 4:12.</li>
		<li>The only way to glorify God is to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death; the more we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, the more we glorify the Father&mdash;John 12:28; 13:31.</li>
		<li>When we die the death of Christ and are conformed to His death, we shall be a magnet drawing others to Christ&mdash;12:32.</li>
		<li>The more we die with Christ, the more we save our soul&mdash;v. 25.</li>
		<li>If we are willing to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, we shall overcome the world and defeat Satan&mdash; v. 31; Heb. 2:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is that we may attain to, or arrive at, the out-resurrection from the dead&mdash;Phil. 3:11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The out-resurrection is the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints&mdash;Rev. 20:4, 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back&mdash;1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s overcomers will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection, a resurrection in which they will receive the reward of the kingdom; this is what the apostle Paul sought after&mdash;Heb. 11:35, 26.</li>
		<li>The out-resurrection should be the goal and destination of our Christian life&mdash;Phil. 3:11-15a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To attain to the out-resurrection means that our entire being is gradually and continually resurrected&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God first resurrected our deadened spirit; He proceeds to resurrect our soul and our mortal body until our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;is fully resurrected out of our old being by His life and with His life&mdash;Eph. 2:5-6; Rom. 8:6, 11.</li>
		<li>If we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, every part of our being will be gradually resurrected; thus, the Christian life is a process of resurrection.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The out-resurrection is a resurrection out of the old creation into the new creation&mdash;Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be in the out-resurrection means to leave everything of the old creation and to be brought into God.</li>
		<li>In the out-resurrection there is no element of the old creation; instead, everything is full of the divine element&mdash;Rev. 21:5a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For Paul to live was Christ as the out-resurrection&mdash; Phil. 1:21a; 3:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The out-resurrection is actually the dear, precious, excellent person of Christ, the One who, through crucifixion and resurrection, has passed out of the old creation and has entered into God&mdash;John 14:3, 20; Heb. 6:19-20.</li>
		<li>The Christ whom we should live is Himself the out-resurrection&mdash;Phil. 1:21a; 3:11; John 11:25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death so that by any means we may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead; this is the only way for the Lord to go on in His recovery, the only way for the Lord to build up His church, the only way to prepare the bride, and the only way to bring the Lord back&mdash;Phil. 3:10-11; Matt. 16:18; Rev. 19:7-9a; 22:14, 20.</li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Virtues</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 4:5-9</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The virtues of Christ for our experience in Philippians 4:5-9 are the expression of a life that lives Christ&mdash;1:19-21a; 2:5-13; 3:8-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul considers forbearance and the lack of anxiety as the first two aspects of the expression of a life that lives Christ.</li>
	<li>Anxiety, coming from Satan, is the sum total of human life and disturbs the believers&rsquo; life of living Christ; forbearance, coming from God, is the sum total of a life that lives Christ; the two are opposites.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Let your forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is near&rdquo;&mdash;4:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Forbearance is reasonableness, considerateness, and consideration in dealing with others, without being strict in claiming one&rsquo;s legal rights; forbearance means that we are easily satisfied, even with less than our due:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>According to Christian experience, forbearance is all-inclusive, for it includes all Christian virtues:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Forbearance includes love, patience, kindness, humility, compassion, considerateness, and submissiveness, a willingness to yield; if we have such an all-inclusive virtue, we shall also have righteousness and holiness.</li>
			<li>Forbearance also includes self-control, moderation, gentleness, understanding, sympathy, wisdom, mercy, peacefulness, looking to the Lord, and even the virtue of admitting that the Lord is sovereign in all things.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>A forbearing person is one who always fits in, whose behavior is always suitable&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 6:1a; 10:1; Phil. 1:19; Isa. 11:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>If we are forbearing, we shall have the wisdom and the ability to supply others with what they need; we shall also have the full knowledge of what to say to them and when to say it&mdash;50:4-5; Col. 1:28.</li>
			<li>To be forbearing is to consider how others will be affected by what we do or say&mdash;2 Chron. 1:10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As an all-inclusive virtue, forbearance is Christ Himself; since Christ is forbearance, for Paul to live was forbearance&mdash;Phil. 1:21a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To let our forbearance be known to all men is to let the Christ whom we live and magnify, whom we take as our pattern and pursue as our goal, be known to all men.</li>
			<li>Only the Lord Jesus lived a life full of forbearance, and only Christ can be our perfect forbearance today.</li>
			<li>To make known our forbearance is to live a life which expresses Christ as the totality of all human virtues.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Immediately after speaking about forbearance, Paul said that the Lord is near:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>With respect to space, the Lord is near us, ready to help; with regard to time, the Lord is at hand, coming soon&mdash;cf. Rom. 10:8-13.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s being near refers primarily to His presence with us&mdash;Matt. 1:23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses every man&rsquo;s understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus&rdquo;&mdash; Phil. 4:6-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The words <em>in everything</em> refer to the many different things which happen to us day by day.</li>
	<li>Prayer is general, having worship and fellowship as its essence; petition is special, being for particular needs; both our prayer and our petition should be accompanied by our giving thanks to the Lord.</li>
	<li><em>To God</em> denotes motion toward, in the sense of a living union and communion, implying fellowship; hence, the sense of <em>to God</em> here is <em>in the fellowship with God.</em></li>
	<li>The result of practicing fellowship with God in prayer is that we enjoy the peace of God; the peace of God is actually God as peace (v. 9) infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer, as the counterpoise to troubles and the antidote to anxiety (John 16:33).</li>
	<li>The God of peace patrols before our hearts and thoughts in Christ, keeping us calm and tranquil.</li>
	<li>If we would have a life free of anxiety, we need to realize that all our circumstances, good or bad, have been assigned to us by God in order to serve us in fulfilling our destiny to gain Christ, live Christ, and magnify Christ&mdash;Rom. 8:28-30; Matt. 10:29-30; 2 Cor. 4:15-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Finally, brothers, what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things&rdquo;&mdash;Phil. 4:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>These virtues are the expressions of God&rsquo;s attributes lived out from within the pursuers of Christ, who is the embodiment of God.</li>
	<li>These virtues are six governing aspects of a life that lives Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A life that lives Christ is true&mdash;ethically truthful, without any pretense or falsehood.</li>
		<li>A life that lives Christ is dignified&mdash;honorable, noble, grave, solid, weighty, and worthy of reverence&mdash;1 Tim. 3:8, 11; Titus 2:2; cf. Rom. 9:21.</li>
		<li>A life that lives Christ is righteous&mdash;right before God and man.</li>
		<li>A life that lives Christ is pure&mdash;single in intention and action, without any mixture&mdash;Matt. 5:8.</li>
		<li>A life that lives Christ is lovely&mdash;lovable, agreeable, and endearing.</li>
		<li>A life that lives Christ is well spoken of&mdash;renowned, of good repute, attractive, winning, and gracious.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Virtue and praise are a summing up of the six foregoing items, in all of which are some virtue or excellence and something worthy of praise&mdash;v. 16.</li>
	<li>To be a proper human being is to express God through His divine attributes in our human virtues, to have a human life filled with Christ as the reality of the attributes of God&mdash;cf. Gen. 1:26.</li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Secret and as Our Power</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 4:11-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ in every kind of circumstance&mdash; 1:19-21a; 2:5; 3:9-10; 4:11-13.</li>
<li>In Philippians 4 Christ is the secret and the power for us to enjoy; we know the secret, and we have the power&mdash;vv. 12-13.</li>
<li>Paul had learned the secret of sufficiency, of satisfaction, of contentment; this secret is actually Christ Himself&mdash;vv. 11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In any environment and in any matter, Paul, who experienced Christ richly and abundantly, learned the secret to be content and to rejoice always&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	<li>According to the book of Philippians as a whole, the secret Paul learned was simply Christ; Paul took Christ as the secret to experience Christ, being content and rejoicing in any situation and in any matter because of Christ.</li>
	<li>Paul had not only learned a secret; he had been initiated and had learned certain basic principles&mdash;v. 12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul had been initiated both into the proper Christian life and into the proper church life.</li>
		<li>After Paul was converted to Christ, he was initiated into Christ and into the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 9:3-19, 25-28; 22:6-21; 13:1-4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He was initiated into the basic principles of Christ and the church.</li>
			<li>He learned the secret of how to take Christ as life (Col. 3:4), how to live Christ (Phil. 1:21a), how to magnify Christ (v. 20), how to gain Christ (3:8, 12), and how to have the church life (1:8, 19; 2:1-4, 19-20; 4:1-3).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we are saved and come into the church, the Body of Christ, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are initiated in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ; because Christ is our secret, we know how to face any kind of situation.</li>
		<li>Because the church has a mysterious aspect, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles&mdash;Eph. 3:3, 9; 5:32.</li>
		<li>The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life, to live Christ, to pursue Christ, to gain Christ, to magnify Christ, and to express Christ; these are the basic principles of the church, the Body of Christ&mdash; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>In everything</em> refers to a particular time when we experience a certain thing of the Lord; <em>in all things</em> refers to a broad range of experiences over time&mdash;Phil. 4:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul could say that both on a particular occasion and on all occasions, both at a certain time and throughout the course of his life, he had learned the secret.</li>
		<li>Paul experienced Christ moment by moment:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He experienced Christ in particular things at particular times.</li>
			<li>He experienced Christ in all things and at all times.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In verse 13 we have a basic principle related to Paul&rsquo;s secret of sufficiency in Christ: &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo;:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The secret in Philippians 4 is to do all things in Christ&mdash;John 15:4a, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Whatever we do should be done in Christ, not in ourselves; this is the secret Paul learned and the secret we need to learn today.</li>
		<li>It is sufficient for us to be in Christ, for He is all-inclusive.</li>
		<li>The way to experience Christ is to do everything in Him.</li>
		<li>If we do all things in Christ, we shall experience Christ, enjoy Christ, and accumulate Christ; this is the way to become rich in Christ and to have many rich experiences of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>The issue of practicing the secret of being in Christ is that for us to live is Christ; because we do all things in Christ, we live Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s word in 4:13 is an all-inclusive and concluding word on his experience of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul was a person in Christ, and he desired to be found by others in Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 12:2a; Phil. 3:9.</li>
		<li>In 4:13 he declared that, being in Christ, he could do all things in Him, the very Christ who empowered him; this was his secret.</li>
		<li>As a person in Christ, Paul experienced Christ and applied Him in all circumstances&mdash;vv. 11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Paul applied the Christ in whom he could be found&mdash;3:9.</li>
			<li>This Christ is real, living, near, available, and prevailing&mdash;4:5b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be empowered is to be made dynamic inwardly&mdash; v. 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ dwells in us, and He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without&mdash;Col. 1:27.</li>
		<li>By such an inward empowering Paul could do all things in Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s word about Christ as the empowering One specifically applies to Christ&rsquo;s empowering us to live Him as our human virtues and thereby to magnify Him in His unlimited greatness&mdash;Phil. 4:8-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 13.</li>
		<li>By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life and be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of&mdash;vv. 11-12, 8.</li>
		<li>To live a life of these virtues is much more difficult than doing a Christian work.</li>
		<li>We are persons in Christ, who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue; this is to live Christ and to magnify Him in His virtues&mdash;1:20-21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would experience Christ as the empowering One, we need to let Him live in us (Gal. 2:20), be formed in us (4:19), make His home in us (Eph. 3:17a), and be magnified in us (Phil. 1:20):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we fail to do these things, Christ will not have the way to empower us.</li>
		<li>When Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him to empower us; then, empowered by the indwelling Christ, we shall be able to do all the things spoken of in 4:8-12.</li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Expectation</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:20-21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The life which Paul lived in the experience of Christ was one that awaited the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would transfigure his body of humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory; thus, he took the Christ whom he experienced as his expectation&mdash;3:20-21.</li>
<li>&ldquo;For our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;&mdash;v. 20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Our national life is not in any earthly country; our real citizenship, our true commonwealth, is in the heavens&mdash;Eph. 2:6, 19.</li>
	<li>Because our citizenship is in the heavens, we should not be occupied with earthly things, the physical things needed for our existence&mdash;1 Tim. 6:6-10.</li>
	<li>In dealing with our body, we should take care of our physical need but should not indulge in excessive physical enjoyment&mdash;Phil. 3:17-19; 1 Cor. 9:27.</li>
	<li>As we await and love the Lord&rsquo;s glorious appearing, we should live a God-expressing and flesh-restricting life&mdash;Titus 2:12-13; Luke 21:34-36; 2 Tim. 4:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo;&mdash;Phil. 3:21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are waiting for Christ to come back so that we may be brought into the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;the transfiguration of our body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His salvation God first regenerated our spirit (John 3:6), now is transforming our soul (Rom. 12:2), and consummately will transfigure our body for our glorification, making us the same as Christ in all three parts of our being (1 John 3:2).</li>
		<li>The body of our humiliation is our natural body, made of worthless dust (Gen. 2:7) and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death (Rom. 6:6; 7:24; 8:11).</li>
		<li>The body of His glory is Christ&rsquo;s resurrected body, saturated with God&rsquo;s glory (Luke 24:26) and transcendent over corruption and death (Rom. 6:9).</li>
		<li>The transfiguring of our body is accomplished by the Lord&rsquo;s great power, which subjects all things to Himself (Eph. 1:19-22); this is the almighty power in the universe.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The transfiguration of our body is the redemption of our body for the full sonship of God&mdash;Rom. 8:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life; our body is still the flesh, linked to the old creation, and it is still a body of sin and death that is impotent in the things of God&mdash;6:6; 7:24; cf. 2 Cor. 5:4.</li>
		<li>Hence, we groan together with the creation and eagerly await the glorious day when we will obtain the full sonship, the redemption and transfiguration of our body&mdash;Rom. 8:19-23.</li>
		<li>The redemption of our body is through the saturation of the divine element by the sealing Spirit of God&mdash;Eph. 1:13; 4:30; 1 Cor. 1:30; Luke 21:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The transfiguration of our body will be the glorification of our entire being&mdash;Rom. 8:30, 17; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Tim. 2:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Objectively, glorification is that the redeemed believers will be brought into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God&mdash;Heb. 2:10a; 1 Pet. 5:10a.</li>
		<li>Subjectively, glorification is that the matured believers will manifest from within them, by their maturity in life, the glory of God as the element of their maturity in life&mdash;Rom. 8:17-18, 21; 2 Cor. 4:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord is in us as the hope of glory to bring us into glory&mdash;Col. 1:27; Heb. 2:10a.</li>
			<li>At His coming back, on the one hand, He will come from the heavens with glory (Rev. 10:1; Matt. 25:31), and on the other hand, He will be glorified in His saints&mdash;2 Thes. 1:10:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) His glory will be manifested from within His members, causing their body of humiliation to be transfigured into His glory, conforming it to the body of His glory&mdash;Phil. 3:21.</li>
				<li>2) Thus, the unbelievers will marvel at Him, admire Him, wonder at Him, in us, the believers.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We are on the way of being brought into glory by the sanctifying work of the Spirit; sanctification is the gradual process of glorification&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11; 1 Thes. 5:23; Eph. 5:26-27.</li>
		<li>The reality of the believers&rsquo; glorification is their gaining of God Himself&mdash;the glory of God is God Himself (Jer. 2:11; Eph. 1:17; 1 Cor. 2:8; 1 Pet. 4:14), and the manifestation of God is the glory of God (Acts 7:2):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The believers&rsquo; entering into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God is their entering into God Himself to enjoy God Himself.</li>
			<li>The believers&rsquo; being transformed in the divine life today is God&rsquo;s being expressed in the believers as glory; hence, this daily transformation is from glory to glory&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; 4:17.</li>
			<li>The consummation of glory into which the believers will enter by transformation in life is that they will be glorified&mdash;their body will be redeemed, and they will thereby enter into the glory of God to fully enjoy God as glory&mdash;Rom. 8:21, 23, 30.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The believers&rsquo; arriving at glorification is the climax of their maturity in the life of God and the climax of God&rsquo;s salvation in life&mdash;Heb. 6:1a; Rom. 5:10a.</li>
		<li>The believers&rsquo; glorification is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy for the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s desire:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The full expression of the believers&rsquo; glorification is the New Jerusalem, which will be manifested in glory&mdash;Rev. 21:10-11.</li>
			<li>This is the full expression in eternity of God&rsquo;s becoming a man in humanity and of man&rsquo;s being conformed to God in divinity.</li>
			<li>This is what God desires and is His heart&rsquo;s delight, and this is also what God is waiting for in His good pleasure&mdash;Eph. 1:5.</li>
