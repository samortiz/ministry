   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHINING IN THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the Lord comes back to enlighten the whole world, He is now walking among the local churches shining over us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church life is not only full of life, but also full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you still can tell a lie, I doubt if you are in the real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the genuine church life, we cannot lie to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before a lie can come out of our lips, the shining of Christ causes it to vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we turn to the Lord and thank Him for His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord Jesus, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was going to lie to the brothers, but your shining saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With our roommates, our husbands and our wives, there is the shining light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the real light in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His face is like the shining of the sun, and He has seven eyes like flaming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When He looks at us, we are under his shining and exposing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even His walk among the churches is shining.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has shining feet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This exposes how dirty, sinful, and dark our walk is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord that He is shining today in the churches!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>SHINING STARS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the book of Revelation, not only is Christ shining, but all the messengers, His servants in the churches, and even the churches themselves are shining.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The churches are the lampstands, and the messengers of the churches are shining stars.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches Rev 1:20, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>. Both the stars and the lampstands are for the night.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the day we do not need the stars or the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But it is still night-time during the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The day is not here until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As shining stars in the church, we do not have any light of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are only good for reflecting the sun s light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we must look unto Him with unveiled face that we might reflect His glory 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This causes us to become the shining stars.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Lord s recovery today in the churches, position means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What we can do and how much we can accomplish also mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It all depends upon how much we are shining and how bright we are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what it means to be a messenger of the Lord in the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The night is so evil and dark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is absolutely no light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But here are some shining stars in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their presence in the church means very much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When they are here, everything is in light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When they are gone, the whole situation is full of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This should be the real elders in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christianity has spoiled the term elder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the Spirit in the book of Revelation does not use this word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is only the mention of the messengers as the shining stars.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If any elder in the Lord s recovery holds the position without shining, that is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not a matter of position, it is a matter of shining.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It does not depend upon how much we can do, but upon how much we shine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And we can only shine by reflecting the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not have any light in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>HOLDING UP THE LAMP</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same principle, lampstands do not have any light of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are simply the stands to support the light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Most Christian teachers talk about the lampstands, but little about the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet if we have the lampstands without the lamps, we are still in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is clear that the churches are the lampstands, but what are the lamps?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In chapter one, we see the seven lampstands, and in chapter four we see the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The seven lampstands are the seven churches, and the seven lamps are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that the lamp is the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some so-called churches may claim that they are the lampstand, but do they have the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not have the Spirit, we are just a stand without a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By itself, the lampstand cannot shine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It needs the lamp, the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we know how the church can shine.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is by and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why we all must turn from knowledge, doctrine, regulations, and ordinances to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the church turns to the Spirit, the Spirit becomes the lamp which the church holds to shine over others.</S>
