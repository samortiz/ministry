   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A STRONG CHARACTER WITHOUT PECULIARITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we continue let me add a word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To have a characteristic is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every one among us is a character, and as a character we surely have some characteristic or characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible you can see that all the Apostles had characters, especially the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He had a real character, and Peter and John also had real characters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They all had their own characteristics, but they were not peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They had characteristics, but their characteristics were not biased nor were they warped.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So in their character there was no peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had characteristics, but no peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to realize that especially Paul and John had been quite transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Transformation actually takes away our peculiar traits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It takes away our peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our natural man is biased and warped and is expressed mainly in our peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don t consider that it is sinful doings and low behavior that is expressed in our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No. A piece of paper may not be dirty or torn, but it may be warped.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be biased means not to be so straight or so right.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But even this is not the full definition of being biased.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may have a lot of sins or no sins; we may have bad habits or good habits, but these are not the expressions of peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peculiarity stands within our being alone, by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A very righteous man may be quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A very holy man, a very spiritual man may be very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament you can see that Paul is so strong, but you cannot find that with him there is something peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to his writings there is no peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the same with Peter and John.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With these New Testament characters you cannot find any peculiar traits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their characters were different with different characteristics, but it is hard to find any peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But with us, nearly every one has some peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church life is full of peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have a peculiarity and I have a peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have some peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I feel that our brother s joking is actually a kind of covering for something that s inward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apparently he likes to joke, but actually I have a sense that it comes out that way because there is a real desire in him to do things right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It may be that this desire bothers him very much and that the only way to relieve this desire is to be humorous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our brother apparently is not a detailed person, but I know from experience that actually he is super detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I never had this impression until I coordinated with him on cleaning and arranging the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To my surprise when we came together to pray it was not unusual for him to have many, many points to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I don t believe that the humor which is expressed is the real brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe there is something else within him that is related to his being too fine and caring to be so right and wanting to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need another brother also to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since I have known this brother I have noticed that as he functions in the meetings he has a strong tendency to present something in a joking way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And no doubt all of us have picked this up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But I would say in personal fellowship with him he is generally very serious with hardly any trace of joking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is very serious and very detailed and very intent on sharing what he really feels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will not let you go until he shares fully what is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have known few brothers in the church life who can talk as long as he can and never seem to run out of something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems as if there is a kind of fountain within him that never runs dry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I realize, though, that deeper within him there is something intangible and indefinable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may be that we still are touching only the outward things and haven t yet hit the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps another brother could add something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My personal times with this brother are quite different from the times in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His concern for what I consider as small things gets to the point of being picky.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is very concerned about details and small things and why things are a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This makes me wonder how he can be so funny in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, he cares for people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He likes people a lot, but I think sometimes when he contacts people they do not know when he is being serious and when he is not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every time that I have fellowshipped with him, the fellowship has been even quite heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is very serious, very detailed, and he analyzes everything very thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I m not sure what this has to do with the humorous side that comes out in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I would ask another brother also to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The last time I talked at any length with this brother was about six months ago here at the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is true that I definitely get an impression there are two different things going on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The person we see in the meetings and the person whom we meet personally and particularly in a one-to-one relationship are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It seems to me that all of the weeks of perfecting have been leading up to this very point so that the Lord can touch this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although I can recognize that this brother has a certain peculiarity, I cannot identify it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am afraid that many of us have even the same or other peculiarities also.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It seems that our brother expresses himself in at least two different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I remember that in the book, The Experience of Life, Brother Lee pointed out that the spirit is the genuine part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I believe how much a person is really in the spirit or not depends on what you can see as a constant or level impression.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a person is not that much in the spirit, it s quite easy to see something of his old man or his natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is easy to see a kind of desire the person has that is somewhat short of the spirit or to see a kind of insecurity expressing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do believe if this brother and all of us were more in the spirit we would see something far more constant and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It may be that what we see are the symptoms that this brother is not that much transformed and not that much saturated with the Spirit.</S>
