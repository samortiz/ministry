<h2 class="head2">B. For Speaking in Tongues</h2><p>In verses 27 and 28 Paul goes on to say concerning tongue-speaking, &ldquo;If anyone speaks in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and let one interpret; but if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s use of the word church in verse 28 indicates that the church meeting is the church. In these verses we see that Paul did not altogether neglect speaking in tongues, but instead gave some regulations concerning it. Two or at the most three may in turn speak in tongues, and one should interpret. However, in some Christian meetings today, everyone is encouraged to speak in tongues. Those with such a practice surely need to pay attention to these verses and learn to speak in turn. The waiting this requires will regulate them and test them. But if there is no interpreter present, they should be silent in the meeting and speak to themselves and to God. As we consider these verses, we see that according to the regulations given by Paul, a Christian meeting should not be conducted like certain of today&rsquo;s Pentecostal meetings.</p><h2 class="head2">C. For Prophesying</h2><p>Verse 29 says, &ldquo;And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.&rdquo; According to this verse, in a meeting two or three prophets may speak, and the other prophets should discern. The word &ldquo;others&rdquo; here refers to other prophets. Verses 29 through 32 speak about the prophets only, not all the members of the church. The other prophets should discern, judge, (lit., discriminate), what is spoken by the prophets. This is to judge or discern whether what is prophesied is of God or not, discriminating the true from the false. This indicates that some prophesying may not be of God.</p><p>In verse 30 Paul continues, &ldquo;But if something is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.&rdquo; &ldquo;Another&rdquo; refers to another prophet, and &ldquo;the first&rdquo; refers to the first prophet. Thus, verse 30 refers to the prophets, not to all the attendants of the church meeting.</p><p>Verse 31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged.&rdquo; According to the context of verses 29 through 32, &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;all&rdquo; (twice) refer to the prophets. The Greek word rendered encouraged here also means comforted. Even the prophets need to learn and to be encouraged.</p><p>In verse 32 Paul says, &ldquo;And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.&rdquo; To say that the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets means that the prophets are not under the control of their spirits, but that their spirits are under their direction. Thus, they can determine when to prophesy and when to cease to maintain good order in the church meeting. Their spirits are not their master, but their means to function. They should learn how to exercise and use their spirits at their discretion.</p><p>Verse 32 clearly indicates that our spirit should be subject to us, not that we should be subject to our spirit. However, some in today&rsquo;s Pentecostalism excuse themselves by saying that whatever they do in the meetings is according to the spirit. They claim that they are carried away by their spirit. For example, someone may shout aloud and not care for anyone or anything else. Should someone ask him why he shouts so loudly, he may reply, &ldquo;This is not up to me; I am carried away by the spirit.&rdquo; This is contrary to Paul&rsquo;s word. He says strongly that we should not be subject to the spirit; rather, the spirit should be subject to us.</p><p>For years I have pointed out our need to exercise the spirit. This implies that our spirit is subject to us. We exercise the spirit; it is not the spirit which exercises us. Do you exercise the spirit, or does the spirit exercise you? The expression &ldquo;exercise the spirit&rdquo; is meant for those who are sober-minded, especially for those who tend to sit quietly in the meetings. All such ones need to exercise the spirit. But to those like the Corinthians who are carried away with their ecstasy, Paul would say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t subject yourself to the spirit, but let your spirit be subject to you. Turn away from your ecstasy and cause your spirit to be subject to you.&rdquo; Do not excuse yourself by saying that everything you do is according to the spirit. The exercise of the gifts must be done in a regulated way, not in an uncontrolled manner. Our spirit must be subject to us. This means that we must have a sober mind to use our spirit in a proper way.</p><p>Verse 33 says, &ldquo;For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.&rdquo; The principle of Paul&rsquo;s charge to the Corinthians in verses 26 through 32, mainly concerning speaking in tongues and prophesying, is to keep a peaceful and becoming order according to what God Himself is.</p>
