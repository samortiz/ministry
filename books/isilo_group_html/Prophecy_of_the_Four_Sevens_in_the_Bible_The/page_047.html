THE SHINING AND WARNING OF THE<br>PROPHETIC WORD MADE MORE FIRM TO US TODAY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Prophetic Word Made More Firm to Us</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Second Half of the Last<br>of the Seventy Weeks, Prophesied by Daniel,<br>Having Been Made More Firm by the Word<br>of the Lord and the Apostle</H2><P>The second half of the last of the seventy weeks, prophesied in Daniel 9:24-27, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Matthew 24:15 and Revelation 11:2 and 13:1-8, and by the apostle's word in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10. The three and a half years of the great tribulation, the second half of the last of the seventy weeks, is very much defined, made more firm to us, in the New Testament. Today I have the boldness to say that the majority of the saints will be raptured on the last day of the three and a half years because Revelation 12:6 says that they will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, which is three and a half years. They will have to pass through the entire three and a half years. Then their nourishing will be finished, and they will be raptured. I also have the boldness to say that the last trumpet will be trumpeted on the last day of the great tribulation. According to 1 Corinthians 15:52, the saints will be resurrected at the last trumpet. The last trumpet will be the seventh trumpet. This understanding makes the prophecy of the consummation of the age more firm to me. I also have seen that the two witnesses will be raptured on the same day as the majority of the saints because they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days. After these days are completed, they will be raptured to the air into Christ's parousia, presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Resurrection of the Dead, Prophesied by<br>Daniel, Having Been Made More Firm<br>by the Word of the Lord and the Apostle</H2><P>The resurrection of the dead, prophesied in Daniel 12:2, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in John 5:28-29 and Revelation 20:4, 6, 11-15, and by the apostle's words in 1 Corinthians 15:20-23, 52 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16. All of these scripture references show how fine the New Testament prophecy is concerning the resurrection of the dead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Rapture of the Overcomers, Prophesied<br>by the Lord in Matthew, Having Been Made<br>More Firm by His Words in Revelation</H2><P>The rapture of the overcomers, prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 24:39-42 and Luke 21:36, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Revelation 3:10, 12:5, and 14:1-5. In Revelation 3:10 the Lord says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth." The hour of trial is the three and a half years of the great tribulation, including its initiation with the shaking of the earth and heaven in the sixth seal, which will be the beginning of the supernatural calamities. Revelation 12:5 speaks of the man-child being raptured to the throne before the three and a half years of the tribulation. After this rapture, the woman, signifying the majority of the remaining saints, will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, or three and a half years. Then Revelation 14:1-5 reveals that the firstfruit, the living overcomers, will be standing on Mount Zion in the heavens, having been raptured to the heavens before the great tribulation (vv. 6-13) and the harvest of the majority of the saints (vv. 14-16).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Prophecy of the Four 'Sevens' in the Bible &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
