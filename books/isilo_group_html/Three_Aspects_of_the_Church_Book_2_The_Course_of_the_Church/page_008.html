<p>Acts 10 speaks of the household of Cornelius in Caesarea. The gospel being preached to the Samaritans was tolerable to the Jews because the Samaritans were a people of mixed Jewish and Gentile blood. The preaching of the gospel to the Ethiopian may have been considered a coincidence by the apostles. And even though Paul had opposed the Lord, he still was of the tribe of Benjamin and considered to be an Israelite (Phil. 3:5). The Jewish believers could tolerate and accept all of these.</p>
<p>In Acts 10, however, God wanted the apostles to preach the gospel to Cornelius, a representative of the Gentiles, and it was difficult to break through. Because Cornelius was a centurion in the Roman legion, he was fully representative of the Gentiles. It was not easy for someone to go to his home and preach the gospel to him, to his family, and to his friends, and the Holy Spirit met resistance in Peter (v. 14). From the record in Acts we see that Peter strongly felt that the church was Jewish and should be in Judea. Peter did not have the concept that the church is universal and did not think that the church needed to spread.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Holy Spirit did a marvelous thing. He showed Peter a vision of &ldquo;a great sheet&rdquo; (v. 11), which represents the gospel. All kinds of things were in that sheet, both the things that Peter considered clean and the things that Peter considered unclean. This means that all kinds of people were in the sheet. A voice told Peter that he should rise up and &ldquo;slay and eat&rdquo; (v. 13). All kinds of people were there, and to &ldquo;slay and eat&rdquo; means that Peter needed to be mingled with them. Eating is taking something outside of us and receiving it into us, making it one with us. Eating is not simply a matter of contacting something, nor is it merely a matter of touching something. On the contrary, eating is taking things and swallowing them; it is a matter of mingling. God showed Peter this vision because He wanted to tell him, &ldquo;You, Peter, a Jew, must be mingled with Cornelius, a Gentile, to become one church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter did not understand and refused three times (v. 16). Eventually, Peter obeyed the Spirit and went to the house of Cornelius, and while he was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word (v. 44). This told Peter and those with him that the church is not of the Jews and that it must spread to the Gentiles; the church is not local but universal. After Peter and the other six brothers returned to Jerusalem, the saints in Jerusalem still did not understand. Peter stood up to testify and told them, &ldquo;As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as also on us in the beginning&rdquo; (11:15). The Holy Spirit fell on the members of the household of Cornelius just as He fell on the Jews in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. Since the work of the Holy Spirit was evident, no one could say anything. This properly and formally opened the door of the gospel to the Gentiles. At this time Peter used the keys of the kingdom to fully open the doors of the church.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would give the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter (v. 19). Peter opened a door on the day of Pentecost, but in the house of Cornelius, he opened another door. On the day of Pentecost he opened the door for the Jews; however, in the house of Cornelius he opened the door for the Gentiles. The salvation of the Jewish Samaritans and the salvation of the Ethiopian eunuch were only an &ldquo;advance opening&rdquo;; the salvation of the household of Cornelius was the &ldquo;grand opening.&rdquo; At this time the Holy Spirit officially spread the church to the Gentiles and broke down the wall.</p>
<p>If the church stayed in one place, it would have more and more problems. In order for the church to eliminate its problems, it must spread; once the church spreads, problems will disappear. Because of the spreading to the household of Cornelius, the Jews expanded their narrow view. Their narrow view, prejudiced hearts, regional concepts, and things not up to the standard of the Body were eliminated. The church was still not fully formed on the day of Pentecost. After the household of Cornelius was saved, however, it was fully formed.</p>
<p>The more kinds of people in the local churches, the better. For example, in a meeting someone may speak in English while others translate into Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese. This is a beautiful scene of the spreading of the church.</p>
<p>Because the church is universal, it is also spreading. The most blessed church is the church that spreads the most. If there is a local church that never spreads, it will have more and more problems until it becomes very weak. On the one hand, we must be careful and serious about the spreading of the church, not being loose or careless and using human methods to promote it. We must allow the Lord to work. On the other hand, we must be clear that the church needs to spread, and we must do our best to raise up churches in every place. Although this does not depend on human effort, we should not limit the spreading.</p>
<p>We should not have the slightest limitation that could cause the church to stop spreading. Promoting the church&rsquo;s spread through human work is ineffective and will not last, but we should bear the responsibility to allow the church to spread in order to eliminate our narrow concepts. The basic principle of the church is that it is eternal and universal; the church must constantly spread on the earth. The growth of the church and the building up of the church are based on spreading.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
