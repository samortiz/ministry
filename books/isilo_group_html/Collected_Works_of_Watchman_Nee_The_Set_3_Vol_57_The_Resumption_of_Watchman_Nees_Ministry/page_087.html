However, God's Word says that everyone who belongs to God is a servant of God. When the Israelites were in Egypt serving as slaves, they did not have any freedom. God delivered them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea for the purpose of serving Him in the wilderness (Exo. 3:18). The number of people under the blood was the number of people who left Egypt. The number of saved ones was the number of serving ones. When the Israelites left Egypt, they brought all the gold and silver with them (Exo. 12:35-36). Therefore, all of the ones who were redeemed served God in material offerings and followed the tabernacle. There was not just a minority who served. In both the Old Testament and New Testament, there is not a distinction between ones who serve and ones who do not serve. Only degraded Christianity makes such a distinction.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND ITS CHANGES</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Salvation Being to Obtain<br />a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>God said explicitly that He would make the Israelites a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). Priests are those who wait on God and follow God. No one is able to come closer to God than the priests. Their job is to serve God. The Israelites were to be a kingdom of priests; the whole nation was to be priests.</p><p>The priests' eating, living, and slaughtering of bulls and goats were all for the purpose of serving God. The proper profession of the priests was to serve God; everything else was a sideline. They did not work as teachers, doctors, or in any other profession. Exodus 19 tells us that God intended that all the Israelites, old or young, great or small, male or female, were to be priests.</p><p>The goal of God's salvation is to gain priests (Rev. 1:5-6a). The blood of the Passover lamb delivered the Israelites with the goal of obtaining and ushering in a kingdom of priests. The greatest calling and also the greatest grace is that men can serve God as priests. The number of those who left Egypt was the number of those who should have served God. The number of those who reached Sinai was the number of those who should have served the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">The Degradation of the Israelites Resulting in<br />a Kingdom of Priests Becoming a Tribe of Priests</h2><p>At the bottom of Mount Sinai, the Israelites worshipped the golden calf and sinned against God. As a result, Moses told the people to kill their own brothers. However, only the Levites obeyed Moses' words; they killed three thousand men (Exo. 32:1-29). The loss of three thousand men was not the greatest loss. The greatest loss was that all the people could no longer be priests. Originally, the twelve tribes were to be priests. Now only one tribe was left (Num. 8:5-19). Originally, there was to be a kingdom of priests. Now there became a tribe of priests. The Levites did not care for human feelings or sentiments; they stood on God's side. As a result, they gained the priesthood. Here we see that some had forsaken their priesthood. They forsook it through the worship of the idol; they established another worship.</p><p>Because of rebellion, the earth opened up its mouth and swallowed up the rebellious ones (Num. 16:30-33). Only one tribe was selected to serve God. Only Aaron's rod budded; all the other rods remained dead (Num. 17:6-10). After the people lost their standing before God, they could come to God only through the priests. Even those who had a heart to come to God were kept outside. The eleven tribes became those who were far from God, and only the Levites were the ones who drew near to God. The eleven tribes became those who could only come to God indirectly, whereas the Levites were the ones who could come to God directly. The eleven tribes became the ones who were served, while the Levites became the serving ones.</p><p>The book of Judges shows that the Levites became excessively honored because the Israelites could not serve, even if they had money. The Israelites had to ask the Levites to serve for them (Judg. 17), and it took a great effort for men to invite a Levite to serve in their house.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_086.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_088.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 87</div><br></body></html>
