<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1><p>"The Lord burdened and commissioned Watchman Nee with a specific testimony of Christ in His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, return, and kingdom. His ministry, therefore, was focused on Christ's death and resurrection for the producing of the church in life to experience the victory of Christ that His kingdom might by ushered in. For this reason, he considered messages on these matters as the central messages. His burden to hold the overcomer conferences and to publish The Present Testimony was to present such central messages. He also translated books in this same category into Chinese" (excerpt from Watchman Nee&mdash;A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age by Witness Lee, pp. 254-255, published by Living Stream Ministry).</p><p>In Volume 36 we have collected eight books by Watchman Nee that match the description given above. The first three chapters in the book Christ Is the Way, the Truth, and the Life are identical to the first three chapters in the book Christ Is All Spiritual Matters and Things. Therefore, only chapters four and five of the latter book have been printed.</p>
