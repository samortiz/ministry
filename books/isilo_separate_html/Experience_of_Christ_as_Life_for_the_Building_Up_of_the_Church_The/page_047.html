This means that there are different kinds of experiences of the same Spirit. In 1 Corinthians the Spirit is the revealing, gift-dispensing, and indwelling Spirit. But 2 Corinthians shows us some deeper experiences of the same Spirit. We have seen that in this second Epistle there are nine aspects of the substantial and subjective work of the Holy Spirit within us: the anointing, sealing, guaranteeing, writing, life-giving, ministering, liberating, transforming, and transmitting. Ultimately, the Spirit transmits all that Christ is with the fullness of the Godhead into us. These aspects are very deep, substantial, and subjective. In this chapter we would like to say more concerning the anointing aspect of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ANOINTING</H2><P>In the New Testament we are told that we have a wonderful thing called the anointing (1 John 2:20, 27). God has anointed us and has attached us unto the anointed One (2 Cor. 1:21). The anointed One is Christ, the Son of God, whom God has anointed above all His partners, His companions (Heb. 1:9). By being attached to Him we all have been anointed. Now we share the anointing from the Holy One. This anointing abides in us and teaches us in everything. The anointing is the moving of the ointment, the moving of the Spirit within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</H2><P>We need to consider the difference between oil and ointment, because both of them typify the Spirit. Exodus 30 speaks of both olive oil and the compound ointment (vv. 24-25). The oil is composed of only one element, the element of the olive, but the ointment is composed of oil plus a number of elements. The compound ointment is composed of one basic element, olive oil, blended and compounded together with four kinds of spices. This compound ointment in Exodus 30 is a wonderful picture and type of the all-inclusive, compound Spirit in the New Testament (Phil. 1:19).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
