   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH LIFE BEING CHRIST, THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the Spirit is the realization of Christ and that Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen that when the Triune God moves, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as the current of electricity is electricity in motion, the Spirit of God is God moving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the Spirit He moves into us, He stays in us, and He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He lives in us, He becomes the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine life is simply God Himself living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God is embodied, He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God moves, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God lives in us, He is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are three factors vital to the church life: Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church life is simply Christ, plus the Spirit, plus the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is God embodied, the Spirit is God moving, and the divine life is God living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that all of you, especially the young people, will speak all these things again and again until you can speak them in your dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Speak of the three factors vital to the church life: Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is God embodied, the Spirit is God moving, and the divine life is God living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is not something organized, not merely a human society.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is Christ, the church is the Spirit, and the church is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is God embodied.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is God moving.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The divine life is God living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all must have this dream, the dream of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A DAILY SALVATION BY THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all must see that the divine life is the Triune God living in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have been regenerated with this divine life, and now this divine life is saving you with a daily salvation Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This divine life saves you from your bad temper, from anger, from worry, and from anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It even saves you from murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the family life there is always murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Husbands may murmur about their wives, and wives may murmur about their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A husband may say that he does not always love his wife because sometimes she is not so lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A sister may say that she does not always submit to her husband because sometimes he is not a proper head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is also murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church life the saints sometimes murmur about the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All this shows how much you need a daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God lives in you in reality, this living of God will save you from murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then to you your husband or your wife will be wonderful, and all the elders will be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need this kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be saved in life as mentioned in Romans 5:10 is not to be saved from perdition, from hell, but to be saved from our daily hell.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps this morning or this afternoon a sister was in hell for three hours because her husband offended her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then she came to a meeting, heard the message, and became happy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a sense, this meeting saved her from her hell.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, I expect that every day you will be saved by God living in you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not forget that God living in you is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Romans 5:10 Paul says that we shall be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Salvation in this verse does not refer to salvation from eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be saved in His life means to be saved from daily failures, from daily weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the life that we are enjoying today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the millennium, the faithful believers will reign in life as kings ruling over all things Rev 20:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, even today we can be kings ruling over our anxiety, over our anger, over our bad habits, over our bad temper, and over murmuring Rom 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can be kings in our daily life and in our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can be kings in our offices.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The sisters who teach school can be kings in their schools, kings ruling in life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the divine life.</S>
