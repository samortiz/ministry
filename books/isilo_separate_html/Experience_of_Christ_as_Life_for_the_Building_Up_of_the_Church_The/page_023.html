Paul told us here that he could be far away from Corinth yet still attend the meeting there in his spirit. Verse 4 says, "In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus." Paul said that when they met, he was there in his spirit. This shows that we can be far away from a place, yet still be there in our spirit. Paul not only attended their meeting but also exercised the Lord's authority to deliver a sinful one to Satan (v. 5). The apostle's spirit was so strong that his spirit was assembled with them to carry out his judgment upon an evil person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One Spirit with the Lord</H2><P>Now we come to chapter six. Verse 17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." This is a marvelous verse showing the believers' organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Our Body Being for the Lord and<br>the Lord Being for Our Body</H2><P>First Corinthians 6 also tells us that our physical body is for the Lord and the Lord is for our physical body (v. 13). Do you have some trouble in your body? If so, you should pray, "Lord, my body is for You, and You are for my body. You have to take care of my body." Chapter six is very deep. It reveals that not only our spirit but also our body is the dwelling place of God. Our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (v. 19).</P><P>This corresponds with Romans 12, which says that if we are going to have the Body life, the church life, we must present our physical body to the Lord (v. 1). We may say that we love the Lord with our heart and serve the Lord in our spirit, but what about our body? We cannot say that we love the Lord and leave our body at home away from the church meetings. We also should have the realization that our body is for the church in the way that we dress. If we realized that our body is for the church, the Body of Christ, we would say, "Lord, how can I misuse my body? How can I usurp my body for other purposes? My body must be solely for Your Body. My body should not be an advertisement of the flesh or of the world. My body should be an advertisement of the Lord's Body."</P><P>We need to remember these three points: 1) he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit; 2) our body is for the Lord and the Lord is for our body; 3) when we use our body properly, we have the Body life. If we misuse our body, the Body of Christ cannot be among us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
