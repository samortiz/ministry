<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Devoured by the Zeal of God's House</H2><P>"For the zeal of Your house has devoured me" (Psa. 69:9a). This verse is quoted in John 2:17 in relation to Christ's cleansing of the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Suffering Much<br>and No One Taking Pity upon Him</H2><P>In this psalm we see also that Christ suffered much and that no one took pity upon Him (vv. 29a, 19-20; John 16:32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Weeping and Entreating God<br>to Deliver Him out of the Waters of Death</H2><P>Christ suffered in His weeping and entreating God to deliver Him out of the waters of death (Psa. 69:10, 13-17, 1-2). Speaking of Christ, Hebrews 5:7 says that He "offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him out of death."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Being Given Gall as His Food<br>While Suffering on the Cross</H2><P>Psalm 69:21a says, "They gave me gall for my food." In Matthew 27:34 we are told that Christ was given gall as His food while suffering on the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Being Given Vinegar to Drink<br>in His Thirst on the Cross</H2><P>"In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink" (Psa. 69:21b). While the Lord Jesus was suffering on the cross, He said, "I thirst," and mockingly they gave Him vinegar to drink (John 19:28-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Stricken and Wounded by God</H2><P>"They persecute him whom You have stricken,/And they recount the pain of those whom You have wounded" (Psa. 69:26). This indicates that Christ was stricken and wounded by God (Isa. 53:10a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Betrayed by One of His Disciples</H2><P>Christ was betrayed by one of His disciples (Psa. 69:25; Acts 1:16-20a).</P>
