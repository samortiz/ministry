   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP IN THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The responsible brothers and sisters have to learn to have the heart of a nursing mother.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that women who have children of their own are more enlarged in their heart; they have a greater capacity for love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to ask God to increase our capacity for love toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The young brothers and sisters should learn not only to fellowship with their parents, but also with other parents.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should also learn to open themselves to the responsible brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church should have the atmosphere of a home, and the brothers and sisters should be as free to fellowship as at home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>VISITATION BEING THE SUPPLY LINE TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Watchman Nee: The church is like an army; it must have the proper supply line.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without the supply line, it will be defeated easily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The supply line of the church is its visitation work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When all the saints are involved in visitation, it is a mark that the whole church is mobilized in the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to preach the gospel in a prevailing way, the word must go out in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today new businesses come up with all kinds of ways to promote their products.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is their declared goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as they can promote their product, they will use any way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gospel is our product, and the sinners are our customers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot work as we did before, limiting ourselves to just one method podium preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we need to preach the gospel by every means.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter where we are and what method we use, our goal is to save more men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not necessarily have to use the same method all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what it means by total mobilization for the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BEING A MATTER OF THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today the church is taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot remain sixteenth-century Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not enough to be a Christian of Luther's time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to return to the nascent condition at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At Pentecost church service was a matter of all the one-talented ones rising up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was the service of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Luke the Lord said that we have to invite people, even if by force, to come to the gospel feast.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Men have to come in order to receive salvation, and for this there is the need for some to go to the streets and lanes of the city and to compel the poor, crippled, blind, and lame to come in Luke 14:16-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once they come in, they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more the servants go out to invite and compel others to come, the more men will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why must there be so much fellowship and visitation in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fellowship and visitation that the church practices today is a kind of basic training; it prepares and equips all the brothers and sisters for service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fifty-two Messages for Building Up New Believers are the basic course work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These lessons cover basic Christian practices; they provide a kind of basic training for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as we are saved, we have one talent, and we need to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The verdict has been passed: We all have one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The conclusion is drawn: We are all useful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the brothers and sisters have to accept our arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one can bury his one talent in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEW BELIEVERS' MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To a nearsighted person, it makes a great difference whether or not he has glasses on; it determines whether or not he sees.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The new believers' meeting is as important to us as glasses are to a nearsighted person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Topics such as prayer, reading the Bible, and rising early have much to do with the building up of our Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before my heart became weak, I used to rise up before 5:30 every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes when I rose up a little late, I would punish myself the next day by waking up earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot be loose with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are loose, it will be hard for us to teach others or to train them.</S>
