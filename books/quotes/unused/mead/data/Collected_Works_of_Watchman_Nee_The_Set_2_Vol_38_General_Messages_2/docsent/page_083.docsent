   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WIVES BEING SUBJECT TO HUSBANDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these verses we have a biblical principle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the family, Ephesians 5 first exhorts the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 24 is directed at the sisters, and verse 25 is directed at the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am not saying that everything related to the family first comes from the woman, but I can say that many things in the family come from the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 24 says, "Let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a sister wants to be married and she comes to me and asks, "Should I marry a certain person?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will surely answer, "Can you be subject to him?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you cannot be subject to him, you are not qualified to marry him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can only marry him if you can submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have never intended to submit to him in your heart, you should not be his wife and should not marry him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The day before yesterday, the brothers came and discussed this wedding with me and asked whether my words should be given before or after the wedding ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, we agreed that my words should be spoken after the wedding ceremony because we were afraid that the words would affect the wedding ceremony itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet what I am saying is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Marrying a person means that you are willing to offer yourself up and say, "I am willing to submit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A fleshly man cannot submit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are of the flesh, you cannot get married.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not think that marriage is something for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to realize that only a spiritual person can marry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the eyes of the flesh, submission is most difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in the eyes of the spirit, every time you are not submissive, you suffer a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not submit, you can give yourself some breathing space, but you will be inwardly wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once a person asked me, "Why should wives be subject to their husbands?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not know why wives should be subject to husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I only know that the God whom I serve says that wives should be subject to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not know why it is right to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I only know that wives should be subject to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One thing I do know: If a wife is subject to her husband, she always brings in spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we may ask a question: What is submission?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 6:1 is Paul's word concerning parents and children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He told the children, "Obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is interesting to note that 5:24 uses the words "be subject" or "submit," while 6:1 uses the word "obey."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A wife submits to her husband, whereas a child obeys his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What does it mean to submit?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Submission is a matter of attitude, a matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What does it mean to obey?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Obedience is a matter of the conscience, a matter of outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Submission is inward, whereas obedience is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose your husband tells you that he wants to eat at twelve o'clock, yet you like to eat at half-past twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You realize that wives should submit to their husbands, so you set the table at twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But how do you do it?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you make a great deal of noise setting the table?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Have you readied the meal by twelve?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, you have.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But are you submitting?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In God's eyes this is obedience; this is not submission.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Obedience is carrying something out; it is accomplishing a task.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God did not say that wives should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If God had said that wives should obey, then wives should do whatever their husbands want them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What God asks from wives is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Submitting means to be meek and nonresistant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not necessarily mean obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, many sisters among us have unsaved husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is telling you to submit to your husband, not to obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If he asks you to go to a dance hall and you go with him, you are obeying, not submitting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What does it mean to submit?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Submission is a matter of the heart, an inward matter, a matter of the spirit, whereas obedience is outward and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then how do we distinguish the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Often wives can disobey their husbands yet at the same time be very submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I know of a brother who is not too young; he is in his twenties.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the Bible says that children should obey their parents, it means little children not adults.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The father of this brother asked him to do something which a Christian cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When many people obey, they do not submit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But this brother was wonderful; he submitted, but he did not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Listen carefully to this word: Submit but not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a very important word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His father forced him to do something that a Christian cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What could he do?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If he did not do it, he would be disobeying, but he had to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What could he do?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He said, "Father, I wish I could do it, but I cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He knelt down before his father, and said in tears, "I wish I could do this, but I really cannot do it."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although he did not obey, he was very submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How many times have you said that you wish you could do something?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whether or not you can is a different question.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But wishing that you could is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I like the expression "I wish I could."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I wish is submission, whereas I could is obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every one of us should be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Not only should our sister submit, but also every brother and every sister should submit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should all submit to one another, and no one should have a hard, rebelling, or insubordinate attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Often we may do something unwillingly and reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is insubordination.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should all learn to submit from our heart.</S>
