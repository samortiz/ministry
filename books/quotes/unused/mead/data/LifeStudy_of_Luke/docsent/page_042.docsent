   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GALILEE 4 Scripture Reading: Luke 6:12-49</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we come to 6:12-49.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This portion of the Gospel of Luke covers two matters: the Lord s appointing twelve apostles vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>12-16 and His teaching His disciples the highest morality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>17-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>APPOINTING TWELVE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Luke 6:12 says, And it came about in these days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the next day, He called His disciples and chose twelve to be His apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus prayed in order to have fellowship with God and seek God s will and pleasure concerning His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Man-Savior did not carry out His ministry by Himself in a way that was independent of God or according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, He fulfilled His ministry according to God s will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In particular, the Lord Jesus did not appoint the twelve by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this matter He acted as a man who was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Lord Jesus was baptized, He put Himself aside.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that in His ministry He would not do anything by Himself, but would do everything by God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 6:12 we have the application of the Lord s baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His prayer the Lord rejected Himself and put Himself aside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the crucial matter of appointing certain ones to be His helpers, to be the apostles sent out to reach others, the Lord did not act in Himself or by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did this absolutely in God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The main point in the choosing of the twelve as described in 6:13-16 is that the Lord Jesus set Himself aside and did not act by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In appointing the twelve, He acted in God, by God, and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TEACHING HIS DISCIPLES THE HIGHEST MORALITY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 6:17-20 we see that the Lord s word in the remainder of this chapter was addressed to His disciples v. 20 in the presence of a great multitude v. 17 , probably composed largely of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, there were two groups with the Lord as He was teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first group was His disciples; the second was the crowd of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to remember this if we would understand the Lord s teaching here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes His word refers to the believers, and at other times it refers to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Much of the Lord s teaching in 6:17-49 is similar to that in chapters five through seven of the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever is decreed in Matthew 5 7, as the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, constitutes the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever is cited in Luke 6:20-49, as principles of the character of God s children, governs and measures the behavior of the believers, who have been born of God and possess His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time of speaking, this portion, except verses 24 through 26 and 39, applied to the believing remnant of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have seen that in chapters five through seven of Matthew we have the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The teaching in chapter six of Luke is not a constitution, but it is the principles of the character of those who believe in the Lord, of those who have been born of God and possess His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As those who have been regenerated by God, we, the believers, have God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we need to see what principles should govern our character, our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How should we conduct ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How should we act and have our being?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The principles given in this chapter answer these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the aspects of the Lord s teaching here are principles that should govern our Christian behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we see this, we shall see the difference between the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5 through 7 and the principles of Christian behavior in Luke 6.</S>
