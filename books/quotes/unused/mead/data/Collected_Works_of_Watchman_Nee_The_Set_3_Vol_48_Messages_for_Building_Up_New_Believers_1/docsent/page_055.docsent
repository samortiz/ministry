   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. General Reading</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>during the Second Period of Time</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A new believer who recently has received the Lord should not engage himself in intense research of the Bible for at least six months because he is not familiar with the Bible as a whole yet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He should rather spend a few months to read through the whole Bible and familiarize himself with it in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After this he can begin serious study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In familiarizing himself with the Bible, he should read the whole book chapter by chapter, consecutively over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The best way is to decide the number of chapters in the Old and the New Testament one wants to read each day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reading should neither be too fast nor too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It should be regular, continuous, and general in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>George M ller read the Old and New Testament a hundred times during his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who have just received the Lord should learn to read the Bible and remember the number of times they have read through it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is good to write a letter to notify a more elderly brother the first time you have finished reading through the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is also good to leave a blank page in your Bible to record the number of times you have read through it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should write the date and the place you finished reading it the first time, the second time, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each time you finish reading it, you should mark down the occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Identify clearly whether it is the Old Testament or the New Testament you have read through.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that you, like Mr. M ller, can read through the Bible a hundred times during your lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a person wants to read through the Bible a hundred times, assuming that he lives for fifty years as a Christian, he will have to go through the whole Bible at least twice a year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can see why you need to spend much time to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The principle of reading the Bible is to go through it chapter by chapter, over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are more advanced in the Lord should pay attention to the way the newly saved ones read their Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes it does good to examine the dates recorded in their Bibles, to check how many chapters they read every day, and to find out where they are each week.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should all pay attention to this work and should not slacken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should remind those who are progressing too slowly, "Half a year has past.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How come you have not finished reading the New Testament once yet?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person reads his Bible according to the above way, after some time his knowledge of the Bible will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If possible, one should try to memorize one or two verses each day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning, a person may have to force himself a little to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It may come as quite a dull chore.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after some time he will reap the benefit of it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. Intense Study</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>during a Specifically Apportioned Time</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first kind of daily Bible reading praying and meditating over the Word is a continuous lifelong practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second kind of reading general reading, involving some kind of Bible study can begin after at least six months are spent gaining some knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every Christian should have a definite plan of studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you can set aside half an hour a day, develop a plan to study the Bible for half an hour a day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you can afford an hour each day, develop a plan that includes an hour of study.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever time you can afford, make a plan that will fit your schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The worst way to read is by "inspiration," that is, casual, unplanned reading that begins at whatever page one feels, at times reading voraciously for ten days and at other times not reading anything for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not adopt this "inspirational" method.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone should have a definite plan of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In reading the Bible, we need to be restricted and disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, do not set too high a standard or too long a time for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you set too long a time, it will be hard to maintain the schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is worse than having no plan at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once you decide to do something, stick to it for five years, ten years, or fifteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not stop after two, three, five, or six months.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why you should consider carefully before the Lord the amount of time you should set aside for your study.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One hour each day should be quite sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Half an hour may be too short; one may not get much done in half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course, if time does not allow you to have an hour, half an hour is still good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One hour, however, is the optimum period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If one can afford two hours, it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Normally, there is no need to spend more than two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have not seen a brother or sister who studies for three hours a day who can maintain this schedule for long.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are twenty-eight different ways to study the Bible, which are covered in the book The Ways to Study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of the twenty-eight ways, the study of the progression of truth throughout the Bible is the most difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For many people, this method should not be attempted until a much later time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The method of word study is a much easier approach.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One can also study metals, minerals, numbers, names of persons, geography, etc. These can be supplementary studies; we do not have to devote all our time to these special ways.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are also the chronologies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we have the time, we can take a look at them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Besides these, there are other ways to study the Bible, like studying prophecies, types, parables, miracles, the Lord's teaching on earth, or doing a book-by-book study, etc. We should go through all these methods one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us assume for now that a person has one hour a day to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He can allocate his time in the following way:</S>
