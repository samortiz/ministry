<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that as soon as the whole church is raptured, many people will be saved on the earth who will become the so-called saints of the tribulation. They say that these people will be saved at the time of the great tribulation. Their scriptural basis is Revelation 7:9-17: "A great multitude which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues...These are those who come out of the great tribulation." Therefore, these people are saved at the time of the great tribulation. If our brothers admit that this group of people are believers that have passed through the tribulation, their theory collapses by itself. They can only say that this group of people is saved at the time of the great tribulation. In this way, they save their theory.</P><P>I am not saying that at the time of the great tribulation no one will be saved. Rather, I am saying that the people in Revelation 7:9-17 are not saved at the time of the great tribulation. I am not jumping to a conclusion. There is a basis for what I am saying.</P><P>(1)As far as the number goes, it does not seem possible for this group of people to be saved at the time of the great tribulation. At the time of the great tribulation, how can there be countless people being saved? At the time of the great tribulation, what is the largest number? Revelation 9:16 mentions two hundred million. The number in chapter seven, which no one could number, must be at least two hundred million. According to the census of the world population, today the whole world has only seventeen hundred million people. Revelation 6:8 says, "Authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth." This means about four hundred million people will die, leaving approximately twelve hundred million people. Revelation 9:15 says, "They might kill the third part of men." This means again over four hundred million people will die, leaving approximately eight hundred million people. Revelation 8:11 says, "Many of the men died." Revelation 11:13 says, "Seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake." This means seven thousand men of renown will die. It also means that an unknown number of the other nameless ones also will die. In chapters fifteen through sixteen we do not know how many more people will die, for that will be the actual great tribulation. In Revelation 9:16, the number of the army of the horsemen is two hundred million. Matthew 25 says that when the Lord comes again to the earth, there will still be many goats and sheep. Excluding these, how many people will be left? In considering the numbers, to say that a countless number of people will be saved at the time of the great tribulation is not logical.</P><P>(2)Looking from a historical perspective, it is also impossible that this group of people is saved at the time of the great tribulation. Is it possible that the aggregate result of the testimony of the apostles on the earth, the testimony of the saints on the earth throughout the ages, and the testimony of the church on the earth throughout the past two thousand years would not come up to the amount accomplished right before the end? Can we say that the number of all the people saved during the past two thousand years is less than the number saved during the tribulation? Nowhere in the Bible do we find any teaching concerning the kind of believers that appear during the tribulation. Therefore, realistically speaking, to say that this group is saved during the great tribulation is impossible.</P><P>(3)Circumstantially speaking, this is also impossible. We know that the judgments that descend from God are divided into seals, trumpets, and bowls. But the judgments of the seals and the trumpets are different from the judgments of the bowls. The seals and the trumpets are God's remedial punishments with the hope that men would repent because of the punishments. As for the bowls, they are simply God's punishments. No one can hope to repent because of these punishments. Therefore, in Revelation 9:20-21, after the seals and the trumpets, there are the words, "The rest of the men...did not repent," and "They did not repent." But after the bowls there is no mention of repentance.</P><P>Therefore, during the great tribulation, the Bible shows us clearly that some people will be killed by the tribulation, while the rest will remain unrepentant. Where is the uncountable number of people saved during the tribulation? This is not to mention the fact that at that time the "triune" Satan will be deceiving and coercing on the earth.</P><P>If this group of countless numbers of people is not saved during the great tribulation, they must be the church saved before the great tribulation. If they are the church, how can we say that the whole church will be raptured before the great tribulation? (As to the detailed explanation of this group of people, I will publish it in my Meditations on Revelation, if the Lord wills.)</P>
