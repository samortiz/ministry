<h1 class="title">The Dispensing of Christ<br />
for the Gradual Building Up of His Body<br />
and the Transmitting of Christ<br />
for the Sudden Raising Up of God&rsquo;s Churches</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:4-23</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The dispensing of Christ to dispense all the riches of the embodied Divine Trinity (Col. 2:9) into His believers is for the gradual building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:4-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God the Father&rsquo;s dispensing, speaking forth God&rsquo;s eternal purpose:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We were chosen by God the Father to be holy&mdash;v. 4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is for us to partake of God the Father&rsquo;s holy nature to be made the same as God in nature&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; Rom. 15:16; cf. Rev. 21:2.</li>
			<li>This is to be sanctified, separated from all things as God is and saturated with God&mdash;Rom. 15:16; cf. Rev. 21:2:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) We need to love God and not love the world (1 John 2:15), being separated from the world by God&rsquo;s word of truth (John 17:14-19; Eph. 5:26), not being fashioned according to this age (Rom. 12:2a).</li>
				<li>2) We need to present ourselves to God to be saturated by God with the element of His holy nature (Rom. 6:19) unto the eternal life (v. 22) to be renewed by the Spirit for our transformation into the image of Christ (Titus 3:5b; Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18).</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We were predestinated by God the Father unto sonship&mdash;Eph. 1:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is to have God the Father&rsquo;s life (John 3:16), being made God&rsquo;s children, the same as God in life by being born of God after God&rsquo;s kind through regeneration (1:12-13; 1 Pet. 1:3).</li>
			<li>This is for our being &ldquo;sonized&rdquo; with God the Father&rsquo;s life in our entire tripartite being&mdash; 1 John 5:11-12; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11; 1 John 3:2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God the Father chose us to be holy by predestinating us unto sonship&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is the divine sanctification for the divine sonship as the center of the divine economy and the central thought of the revelation in the New Testament&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11; 1 Thes. 5:23; Rev. 21:2, 7.</li>
			<li>In order to be sanctified for sonship, we must care for the sanctifying Spirit speaking and working in our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 6; 15:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God the Son&rsquo;s dispensing, speaking forth the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 1:7-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We were redeemed by God in and unto Christ, who is the element of the Divine Trinity; Christ&rsquo;s being the element means that He is for dispensing to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy to head up all things in Christ&mdash;vv. 7, 10.</li>
		<li>This heading up takes place by Him, as the element of the entire Divine Trinity, dispensing Himself into us for the building up of His Body; when the Body is built up, Christ is the Head in actuality&mdash; vv. 10, 22-23.</li>
		<li>The Son&rsquo;s dispensing in His redemption transforms God&rsquo;s chosen people with Christ as the element of life into a treasure for them to become God&rsquo;s inheritance, His private and personal possession&mdash;v. 11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God the Spirit&rsquo;s dispensing, speaking forth the application of God&rsquo;s accomplished purpose&mdash;vv. 13-14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit&rsquo;s sealing saturates us continuously unto the redemption of our body&mdash;v. 13; 4:30:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This sealing transforms us into a treasure to God as His inheritance&mdash;1:18; cf. 2 Cor. 4:7; Eph. 3:8.</li>
			<li>The more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18b; Col. 3:10; cf. 2 Cor. 3:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Spirit&rsquo;s pledging guarantees that God is our inheritance&mdash;Eph. 1:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Spirit is the pledge, the foretaste, the sample, of what we will inherit of God in full&mdash; 1 Pet. 2:3; Psa. 34:8.</li>
			<li>This pledging is unto the redemption of our body as God&rsquo;s acquired possession&mdash;Rom. 8:23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The transmitting of Christ is for the sudden raising up of God&rsquo;s churches&mdash;Eph. 1:19-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see the fourfold surpassing greatness of God&rsquo;s power&mdash;resurrecting power, ascending power, subjecting power, and heading-up power&mdash;v. 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ overcame four layers of opposition by transcending through Hades, the earth, the air, and even the third heaven&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Acts 2:24; Eph. 1:21; Heb. 4:14; 7:26.</li>
		<li>Christ transcended far above all the layers of trouble to transmit not only His authority but also His transcending power to the church that the church may be formed&mdash;Eph. 1:19, 22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The sudden raising up of God&rsquo;s churches over the whole earth is because of the transmission of the transcending Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fine dispensing in the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with us constitutes the Body of Christ, whereas His transmitting brings forth the Body of Christ:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ as the Spirit of life is gradually dispensing Himself as the element of God&rsquo;s riches for the growth, the building up, of the Body.</li>
			<li>Christ as the Spirit of power is striking suddenly to raise up the churches of God for the spread, the increase, of the Body.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>His transmission is like that of a rushing violent wind to set up the churches, which are the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 2:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>On the day of Pentecost, such a step was taken by the ascended Christ to have a sudden &ldquo;strike&rdquo; among the human race&mdash;vv. 1-11, 16-21, 41-47.</li>
			<li>This sudden &ldquo;striking&rdquo; brings the churches into being and makes them transcendent over all the four layers of persons, matters, and things which oppose the raising up of God&rsquo;s churches&mdash; cf. 4:19-31.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since the transcending Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, His transcending transmission includes all the rich threefold dispensing of the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 3:20-21; Phil. 4:13.</li>
