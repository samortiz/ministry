   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHT GOD'S RESTORATION AND FURTHER CREATION 5 ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION d.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ultimate Consummation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the ultimate consummation, the climax of Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to recall the various steps in the process of God's restoration and further creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit was brooding over the darkness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Light came, and there was a division between light and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God made the expanse to divide the things above from the things beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Next God called the dry land out of the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Out of the dry land the plant life was generated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the plant life, the fourth-day lights came in to shine upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then came the fish life, the bird life, the cattle life, the beast life, and all the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man is the climax of God's creation because man bears God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1 God Was Expressed and Represented</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man is the expression of God because he bears God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He also has the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man was committed with God's dominion over the seas, the air, the earth, and especially over all the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man has power, authority, and dominion because man looks like God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man bears the image of God; so, man has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The climax in God's creation is man bearing God's image and representing God with His authority over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When man looks at God and God looks at man, they look alike.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I take a photograph of you, you will look like the photograph and the photograph will look like you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, God can say, "Man, you are very much like Me."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man will reply, "God, You are so much like me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We two are very much alike."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Also, when man comes out of the presence of God, he is the ruler over all created things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has authority to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is dominion, the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The two crucial words in chapter one of Genesis are image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may forget the creeping things and the fish, but don't forget man with image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man was not made in the image of a serpent or scorpion, but in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the climax: man bearing God's image, exercising God's authority to maintain dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Image and dominion were sown as two seeds in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, these seeds need the whole Bible to grow and develop.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The harvest, the full maturity, is in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The whole New Jerusalem expresses God, bearing God's appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Jerusalem also exercises God's divine authority to maintain God's dominion for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, these two seeds are growing in you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The image of God and the authority of God are constantly growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consider the case of a young married couple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The husband loves the wife, and the wife loves the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although she loves her husband, the wife says within herself, "Although I love you, you are just a naughty young man."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is doctrinally correct to tell the wife that her husband is her head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the wife will say within herself, "I know that my husband is my head, but actually he is a naughty young man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is hard for me to respect him."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day the husband is saved, and the divine life enters into him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the seed, and the seed grows in this young man day after day, month after month.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps after eighteen months, the wife will look at her husband and say, "Surely I must respect him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once he was just a naughty young man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But look at him today!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has some weight.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is not so loose, so light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is weighty."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no need for the husband to exercise authority and say, "You must know that I am now a Christian husband.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must submit to me."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The husband need not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever the wife looks at him, she will realize that his words are weighty, that there is something precious and valuable about him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Spontaneously she respects him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Formerly she argued.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now she respects and honors him, considering seriously everything he says because he now bears the image of God, and out of this image comes the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many people have read Watchman Nee's book, Spiritual Authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They simply utilize that book, saying, "We are the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are the leaders of a group of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are God's authority."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you say this, you are through with God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You do not bear the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the Lord Jesus came, He never held any attitude toward people that He was the authority and that people had to submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He never did this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, when He was on this earth, He bore the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He also had the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Authority always comes from the image.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The ultimate consummation is that God is expressed and represented.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nothing can be higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When God is expressed and represented, that is the climax.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Man was made in God's image that man might express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Life with the image is for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God gave man dominion over all things that man might represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you are going to represent God with authority, you need to express God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The whole story of the Bible is just one story, telling of the saints who expressed God and represented God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need now to consider eighteen cases covering the Old and the New Testaments.</S>
