   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER DAILY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to bring to your attention 1 John 5:11-12, which says, And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How is the overcoming life given to us?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is given to us in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no way for us to receive the overcoming life except through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He who has the Son of God has life, and he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God gives us His Son, He is not giving us just the prescription but the very Doctor Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God does not give us merely life; He is giving us this life in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having the overcoming life is not just a matter of receiving life; it is a matter of receiving the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when our relationship with Christ is improper, problems develop.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we doubt Christ s faithfulness and His promises, we will have problems within.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God does not give us patience, meekness, or humility independently of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He gives us patience, meekness, and humility in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The minute we are not right with His Son, we lose our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why we need a proper relationship with Christ every day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every day we should say, Lord, You are my Head, and I am Your member.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, You are still my life, and You are still my holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we turn our eyes to ourselves, we will find none of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if our eyes are turned to Christ, we will have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot hold on to holiness, victory, patience, or humility apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we have Christ, we have holiness, victory, patience, and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Chinese have an expression: As long as the green mountain remains, there is no fear of the shortage of firewood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is not giving us firewood ; He is giving us the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as the mountain is there, the firewood will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We believe that God s Son is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The biggest reason for failure in many Christians is that they live by feelings and not by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we fail, it does not mean that everything we have experienced up to that point is void and invalid.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It merely means that something has gone wrong in our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should never think that a person needs to fail after he has overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before we overcome, we have to fail; God wants us to fail and fail miserably.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after we overcome, there is no need to fail!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even when we fail, such failures should be only occasional ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are in Adam and we feel cold, callous, and unclean, it means that we are indeed cold, callous, and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when we are in Christ, we should tell ourselves that we have holiness and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever we say we have, we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>GROWTH THROUGH SEEING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AND RECEIVING GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Finally, let us consider what growth means.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We agree that we should still grow after we overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some are too proud; they think that after they have overcome and are sanctified there is no need to go further.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It may be true that we have overcome and have been sanctified, but we have to realize that entering into an experience is the same as passing through a gate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without passing through a gate, we cannot walk on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can grow only after we have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should realize that man has a free will; he is rational and he has feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we overcome, we overcome only the sins that we know of; we cannot overcome the sins that we do not know of.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why there is the need of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is the one sin that you are aware of?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose you have a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you have truly overcome in Christ, you will have the patience to overcome your temper, and you cannot grow any further as far as patience is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your patience is the ultimate patience because this patience is from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This patience is the same patience that Christ had when He was living on earth during His thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If your patience is not a false patience and if this patience is the patience of Christ, you cannot be any more patient, because you have the patience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can overcome only the sins that we are aware of.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are, however, sins that we are not aware of, and these are not included in our experience of the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consequently, we need John 17:17, which says, Sanctify them in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, we have 1 Corinthians 1:30, which says, But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the other hand, we have John 17:17, which says, Sanctify them in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ sanctifies us, and truth increases the measure of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is there a brother that knows the whole Bible from the first day?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No, we know it gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Truth tells us what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, two years ago, we might not have known that a certain thing is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we realize that it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We might not have known two weeks ago that something is sin, but today we realize that it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many things which we considered to be good and which we approved of before become sin to us later.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is a difference between the past and the present because the more truth we know, the more sin we discover, and the more sin we discover, the more we need Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The greater the capacity we have, the more we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Daily we have to study God s Word carefully so that we will see what is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more we see our sins, the more we have to tell the Lord, God, show me in these matters that Christ is my victory and my supply.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers and sisters, if we want to grow, the light of the truth is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The light of the truth will reveal our mistakes and show us our own vulnerability.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once the light of the truth exposes our condition, our capacity will be increased, and the more our capacity is increased, the more we can assimilate.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I like 2 Peter 3:18 very much.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It says, But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is one of the few places in the Bible that speaks of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We grow in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What does growing in grace mean?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No one grows into grace; we all grow in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We cannot grow into grace; we can only grow in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Grace is God doing something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For us to grow in grace means that we need God to do more things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Suppose God has done five things for me already.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But there are still three things which God has to do for me.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>My need has increased; therefore, I need God to do more for me.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Herein lies the relationship between truth and grace: Truth exposes our need, while grace supplies our need.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Truth shows us where our lack is, while grace fills up that lack.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God has not only truth but also grace!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the Old Testament, men failed repeatedly because they had only the truth; they did not have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They had the law, but they did not have the strength to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Thank the Lord that He has shown us the truth and supplied us with grace!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I can say before God, I am forever a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I am forever a pauper.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I have to come to You today, and I will come to You tomorrow and the day after.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Thank God that I can ask of Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I can ask of Him on Monday, and I can ask of Him on Tuesday.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we bother God this way and ask of Him in this way, He will say that we have grown in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The more we see our failures, the more we will ask of God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We will ask all the more for Him to take responsibility for our case.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We will say, Lord, I am still helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I still need You to bear my responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Once we see that we have done something wrong, the first thing to do is say to God, I confess my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>At such times, you must call sin by its proper name.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>You must call sin a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God, I will not change myself anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I have learned one more lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I can never change, and I do not intend to change.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>God, I thank You because this is another chance to boast in my weakness!</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God, I thank You because You can make it!</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I thank You because You can remove my weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Brothers and sisters, every time we boast in our weakness, the power of Christ will tabernacle over us.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Every time we say that we cannot make it, God will show us that He can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If we do this time after time, we will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Tonight I will mention a few examples to show you the meaning of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>There are many sins which we do not realize are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But once we know, we should say, God, I have sinned!</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>I need Christ to live out His life!</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I can testify that once a man mistreated me and I said a few rash words to him.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>I knew that it was wrong to say rash words to others, but I argued that he was more wrong than I and that he had not apologized to me.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I was wrong only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Should I have apologized to him instead?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Yes, God wanted me to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The person had offended me, but I had forgiven him and was no longer angry with him.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Yet I still had to apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I thought I was doing quite good already, but I was still short of the standard of Matthew 5, which says that we have to love our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If I could love that person, I would be able to love even a cat or a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I had written a letter acknowledging my rash words, but since I could not love him, I decided I would not send the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>I decided that I would write another one when I could love him.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>I did not hate him, and I had forgiven him, but I could not love him.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Only God could love him.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>God says that loving is the truth and not loving is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>I wanted to overcome, and I wanted to fight with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>I said to the Lord, If You do not cause me to love him, I cannot love him.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>When I said that I could not love and that God is the only One who can love, I found myself loving him.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>On the one hand, the truth tells us that we should love.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>On the other hand, grace supplies us with the strength to love.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Such dealings sometimes take a few seconds and sometimes take a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Miss Fischbacher had a co-worker who always gave her a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The co-worker would always come up with some ideas which made her suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>If Miss Fischbacher said that there was such-and-such a thing, the co-worker would deny that there was such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>If Miss Fischbacher said that there was no such thing, the co-worker would argue that there was such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>It seemed as if she was always trying to show others that Miss Fischbacher was dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Miss Fischbacher tried to endure this but could do nothing about her behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Every time Miss Fischbacher saw this person, she would either pat her shoulder or shake her hand as an outward sign of love.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Outwardly everything seemed to be well, but inwardly it was not well.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>One day Miss Fischbacher read 1 Peter 1:22, which says, Love one another from a pure heart fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>She pondered and thought that it was impossible for her to love this person, much less to love her fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>She told the Lord, I cannot overcome in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Lord, I have found that this is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>You have said that we should love the brothers fervently, but I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>This certainly is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>She asked God to remove this sin from her.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>She did not hate that person, and she had spent time with her, but it was difficult for her to love this person.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Every time she saw this person, she tried her best to love her, but it never worked.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>One day she locked herself in her room and prayed to God, saying, I should love her, but I cannot love her.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>This is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>I will not let You go today until I can love this person.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>She prayed for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>In the end, the Lord s love filled her up, and she felt that she could even die for this person.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>She not only loved her but also loved her fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Because she loved her fervently, she prayed for her the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>The next day after her routine work, she prayed for the person again.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>She had not only the experience of victory but also the experience of power.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>This is the meaning of the truth sanctifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>This is the meaning of growing in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>The truth enables us to see what sin is, and grace supplies us with the strength to overcome the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Once we find out what sin is, we will not let go until we overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>This is the way we grow in grace day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>There were once three British sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>One was engaged, while the other two had decided to remain single.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>All three were working for the Lord in inland China.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>The sister who was engaged was the most unhappy one.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Although her fianc wrote often to comfort her, she was continually depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>One day while she was feeling lonely in her room, she wept.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>The other two sisters asked, Why are you feeling lonely?</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>You have a fianc who always writes to you!</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>It should be the two of us who feel lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>After the two said this, they went back to their rooms and suddenly felt lonely as well.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>They thought about their work in the inland regions and their strange food and uncomfortable dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>How lonely this was!</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>Indeed, sin is infectious.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>While they were feeling sorry for themselves, they recalled the Lord s Word, And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>They also recalled Psalm 16:11, which says, In Your presence is fullness of joy; / At Your right hand there are pleasures forever.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>They told the Lord, Loneliness is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>You have said that You will be with us until the consummation of the age; therefore, we say that loneliness is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>You have said that in Your presence there is fullness of joy, and at Your right hand there are pleasures forever; therefore, we say that loneliness is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>They both knelt down and prayed, Lord, we acknowledge that loneliness is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>From the time that they dealt with their loneliness in such a specific way, their loneliness never came back to them.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>Hallelujah!</S>
