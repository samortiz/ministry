   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD CHOOSING THE FOOLISH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WEAK THINGS OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who can advance more those with wisdom or those with power?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, neither fleshly strength nor fleshly weakness can help a person to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to advance, a person has to be seeking, hungry, and consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to know whether a person is advancing or backsliding, there is no need to consider the wisdom or power of his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All we have to do is consider his faith, prayer, consecration, and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Saul was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward, yet God did not choose him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>David was an ordinary man, yet God chose him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God chooses those whom the world despises.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 1:27-28 mentions five kinds of people who are qualified to be chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are the foolish, the weak, the lowborn, the despised, and those who are not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How many people believe this word?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you really believe this word?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid when some find them- selves less intelligent than others, they become discouraged and say to God, "It is useless to choose me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That man is better; he is more useful."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet God has not chosen him; He has chosen you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may not believe this, but it matters little whether or not you believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as God's Word has said it, it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has chosen the foolish things and the weak things of this world, in order to put the wise and the strong to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Last year two brothers came to me in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One was slow in thought and the other was slow in words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both felt called and chosen by the Lord to serve Him, but neither dared to answer His call.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One said that his mind was too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It took him a long time to understand what would take others only five minutes to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The other said that his words were not coherent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They asked if there was any way to improve their eloquence and their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I looked at them and said, "As far as I am concerned, both of you are very qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one among us is as qualified as the two of you."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They asked why I would say this, and I answered, "The Bible says that God has chosen the foolish things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has not chosen those who are eloquent or quick in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are too good, God cannot use you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God can only use you if you are not that good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He chooses those who have not."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I continued, "You two should stand before the world and testify of the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Show the world that wisdom and eloquence are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are somewhat intelligent, you could not testify in this way for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the very fact that you have no wisdom or eloquence qualifies you to prove to the world that God has not chosen the eloquent ones."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law of God was given by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But he did not have any eloquence; his brother was the eloquent one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet God chose his brother to be the priest to speak to God, and chose him to give the law and speak to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Aaron was eloquent, but God told him to remain in the tabernacle and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moses was not eloquent, yet God told him to speak the law in front of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this we see that natural wisdom and power account for nothing in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>REJECTING THE POWER OF THE FLESH IN GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some may say, "Paul was eloquent, and he was intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why then did God choose him?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually Paul was not used by God because of his natural virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was physically weak and did not speak with persuasive words of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I admit that Paul was intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But you must remember that Paul's wisdom was put under the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said that he was determined not to know anything among the Corinthians except Christ and Him crucified 1 Cor 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A wise man has to do one more thing than a foolish man he has to reject his own wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God does not need man's wisdom or power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we said yesterday, we have to lose everything in death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The flesh must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is seeking in China for a group of men who would know their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who do not know their flesh are not qualified to be God's workers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am not discouraging men from giving up their jobs to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am not saying that it is difficult to find men who would want to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have met dozens of men every year who have a heart to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I find very few who will condemn their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many people want to work for God, but they do not realize that God does not want the old creation; He wants the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must learn to deny our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In working for the Lord, the crucial point is not the result, but the source.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Does something originate from the flesh or from the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The value of a work is not judged by its result, but by its source.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A work does not become more valuable because it produces good result.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The value of a work depends on its source.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In evaluating a piece of work, one should ask whether it was done by himself or by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am ashamed to admit that after I work, even though there are often good results and men receive help, I have to confess to the Lord because it is I, rather than God, who has been doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God is leading us day by day to stop our work so that we will realize that we cannot accomplish God's work and that only God Himself can accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>SMITING ALL THE AMALEKITES</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Finally, let me remind you of one thing: First Samuel says that God charged the Israelites to smite all the Amalekites and not to spare them 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is asking us to do the same thing today to smite all the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is God's firm stand.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One day He will lead you to the point where you will thoroughly hate everything that is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is a definite date when we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is a definite date when we overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is a definite date when we receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the same way, there is a definite date when we realize that we are completely useless, and we condemn ourselves and deal with our flesh in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Perhaps this day has not come yet.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But when that day comes, we will see that everything of the natural life must be smitten; nothing can remain.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Sinful things need to be smitten; so do excellent things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Bad things need to be removed; so do good things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Useful things need to be removed; so do useless things.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Nothing of ourselves should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>That day will be the day of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>That day will be the day when we can truly serve the Lord and work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Prayer: Lord, we confess the sin of being successful in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We confess the sin of all our endeavors.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Lord, we confess the sin of doing everything according to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We ask that You calibrate our work according to the light of Your judgment seat.</S>
