   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Buy for yourselves" touches many points:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 At that time there is still the possibility and opportunity to buy oil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Note that this does not mean that dead people still have the opportunity to be saved after their resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the unsaved are not resurrected at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2 This implies that the oil of the five prudent virgins was also bought originally.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They paid a price for their oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From this we know that slothful ones cannot be filled by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3 For the infilling of the Holy Spirit, there is a price to be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It cannot be obtained by begging.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When one goes to buy, he must know what he wants to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Often when we meet friends in a department store and ask them what they want to buy, they say they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not see the need to buy oil, or they know the price but cannot pay it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most believers today do not know the importance of the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The amount of oil in the lamp is not sufficient to last past midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the oil in the vessel is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The new covenant in the heart can only produce new desires; it cannot supply the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having only the desires causes frustration because there is not the power to fulfill them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the infilling is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since man needs it, he should pay the price for it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that as long as one is saved, he is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One must first consider the price.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider the Lord's word about the building of the tower and the king going to war Luke 14:28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When many hear of the high price, they turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not realize the need for the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The price differs for each person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may have to clear up matters, while others may need to get rid of certain things in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In short, oil requires that a price be paid; it cannot be obtained for free.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even when the oil is obtained, it is not for the interest of the individual but rather for the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In working for God, many love to use their gift and power as a kind of ornament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But God never exalts Christians by gifts and power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The price may not always be known; nevertheless, it is there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The most important thing here is the dealing with sin; it is the prerequisite.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before sin is dealt with, one cannot consider paying the price.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The confession of sins is not the paying of the price; it is our undisputed duty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even the five foolish virgins did that.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>4 Paying the price.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A penny of price will buy a penny of goods.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever price one pays, that much oil he will get.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The cross cannot be separated from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The killing which comes before death of the Lord should be magnified in our body 2 Cor 4:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cross opens up room for the new covenant to move in. The infilling of the new covenant is not necessarily sensed or felt; it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not necessary for us to be able to sense our heartbeat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is enough that the reality of the heartbeat is there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only begotten Son has been given, but the oil cannot be given; it must be bought.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are four items in the Bible the obtaining of which demands that a price be paid. a Proverbs 23:23 says, "Buy the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To know the truth, we must have a determination to practice the truth, then seek and pursue it. b Revelation 3:18 says, "gold refined by fire," c "white garments," and d "eyesalve."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Buying here is not for the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God cannot ask the unbelievers to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the church in Laodicea is still the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gold refined by fire signifies the faith that can go through testing without suffering defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the faith in dealing with the environment 1 Pet 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For God to allow a believer to pass through trials is an honor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a believer passes through trials, God is glorified before Satan, as He was with Job</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Revelation there are two kinds of white garments: a The white garment obtained before God is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is our being cleansed when we put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those without this white garment are not saved. b The white garment before the Lord is the righteousness that comes from the moving of the Lord's Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those without such a white garment are naked before the Lord and cannot receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>5 This section gives us the hint that the oil must be bought anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The infilling of the Holy Spirit is not something that is up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sooner or later all believers will have to be filled by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not think that the five prudent virgins went to extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the time comes, God will force you to go to extremes too.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Ephesians 5:18 is a command.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you do not keep it today, you will have to keep it someday.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>6 Where do the foolish virgins go to buy the oil?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At that time, the end of the tribulation, who will be on earth to sell the oil?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There will be two: Enoch and Elijah Rev 11:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They are the "olive trees," which bear oil-producing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Zechariah 4:11-12 also speaks of them as the oil-producing plants.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Enoch and Elijah were both prophets who had the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They were the sons of oil, supplying others with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But note, Enoch and Elijah can supply only part of the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To be full of the Holy Spirit still requires our own pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>7 How can there be suffering after resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible does not consider this a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You may have the prejudice that there will be no suffering after the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But one must realize that everyone who is suffering in hell is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After resurrection, some will have joy, while others will have suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If a Christian's temper is not dealt with when he is alive, it will not be dealt with after his death either.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The greed, pride, and selfishness of the rich man were still there after he died.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Death cannot make a person holy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Otherwise, every man would be made holy, since every man dies once.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For this reason, after resurrection there is the need to trim the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In verse 8 the lamp is going out, which means that the lamp can never actually go out.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The life that God gives us will forever remain.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Yet many Christians' experience of the Holy Spirit is in a situation of "going out."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many times it seems as if it has "gone out," but actually the Holy Spirit never leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although the Holy Spirit cannot leave because of man's unfaithfulness, there are many Christians who are at the point of "going out."</S>
