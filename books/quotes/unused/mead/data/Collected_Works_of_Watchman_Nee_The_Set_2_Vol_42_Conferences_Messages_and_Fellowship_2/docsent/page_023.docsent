   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"WHAT I AM DOING YOU DO NOT KNOW NOW,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT YOU WILL KNOW AFTER THESE THINGS"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord was determined to wash the disciples' feet because He wanted the disciples to be in His presence all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter was not without shortcomings, but he also had his good side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He would not do what he did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He asked questions whenever he did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When it was Peter's turn, he refused to be washed and asked the Lord, "Do You wash my feet?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord answered, "What I am doing you do not know now, but you will know after these things" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a helpful word for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today there are many things which we do not understand, but we still have to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, we may understand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not just do things that we understand and ignore the things that we do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be humble, pliable, and willing to accept the Lord's work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a blessing to allow the Lord to work on us without understanding what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter said that the Lord should by no means wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether or not he understood what the Lord was doing, he thought in his heart that he could never allow the Lord to wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John purposely recorded the incident of foot-washing to show its spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can learn many precious lessons from this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times, we are like Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not allow the Lord to do anything that we do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are willing to obey and to allow the Lord to work on us even when we do not fully understand, we will eventually understand what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should be humble and pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not argue like Peter, saying, "You shall by no means wash my feet."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"UNLESS I WASH YOU, YOU HAVE NO PART WITH ME"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Peter said this, the Lord said, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me" v. 8 . The Lord said "Unless I wash you"; He did not say, "Unless I wash your feet." Everyone who has a part with the Lord has been washed in His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course, the washing in this verse also includes the washing of the feet, because it was the Lord's answer to Peter's question.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word of the Lord means two things: on the one hand, it means that those who have not been washed by His blood have no part with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the other hand, it means that those whose feet have not been washed by Him cannot maintain a fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a light bulb does not shine, it can either mean that something is wrong with the bulb or something is wrong with the light switch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One must first examine the bulb to see if it has burned out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is nothing wrong with the bulb, he must examine the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He may find that grease and dirt have gathered around the metal connectors and have prevented electricity from passing through which, in turn, causes the bulb to not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a picture of our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We think that if we are separated from the Lord, it means that we have committed some gross sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, a little separation is enough to separate us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do we have a part in the Lord today?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not asking if we are saved; I am asking if we have maintained our fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We might have said to the Lord in the past that Christ is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But can we say the same thing today?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, last year we had a glorious time praying, praising, and thanking the Lord at the Lord's table in Chuenchow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But last week at the Lord's table meeting, was our prayer, praise, and thanksgiving as glorious as before?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believe many people would say that the taste was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we cannot maintain a constant, fresh fellowship with the Lord, it proves that we need the foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Foot-washing is not for outward appearance, morality, or godliness; it is for maintaining the sweetness and freshness of our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"HE WHO IS BATHED HAS NO NEED</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>EXCEPT TO WASH HIS FEET, BUT IS WHOLLY CLEAN"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Peter heard the Lord's declaration that he would have no part with Him unless he was washed, he changed his tone, saying, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head" v. 9 . Peter's refusal and his consent were both marks of a novice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He agreed to be washed, but he wanted not only his feet to be washed, but also his head and hands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the Lord had washed his head and hands already.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need to wash the head and hands again; once is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The feet, however, are different.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They touch the earth every day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are in contact with the earth and are defiled by the world every day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord could not grant Peter's request.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Crucifixion is once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The shedding of the blood is once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people want to be saved once more.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Like those in Hebrews 6, they want to renew their repentance, but this is crucifying the Son of God afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times I have considered the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A few months ago, a preacher came and spoke with me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He asked, "Is salvation once for all or does it come to us many times?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I asked, "Have you received the grace of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I then asked, "Is the grace of God free or does it come with a price?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He answered, "It is free."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then I asked him to remember two things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First, something that is free does not require a price.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It does not require a price now and does not require a price later.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once a price is involved, it becomes a loan.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today grace is free, but if grace asks for a price tomorrow, it is a loan and no longer free.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Second, grace is given as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Jews think that they must have good works before they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is like a cash transaction.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But for Christians, we first receive grace and then have good works.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our salvation and forgiveness are free grace; they have nothing to do with our works.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once we are saved, we are saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once the Lord washes away our sins, we are washed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we want the Lord to wash our sins a second time like Peter, He will not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is only one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In typology this means that there is only one washing of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But foot-washing goes on continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our feet walk in the wilderness of this world daily, and it is inevitable for our feet to be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Foot-washing allows us to have a sustained joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do we want to be as joyful as the day that we were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many people think that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, the Lord wants us to have such a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is why He washed the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Foot-washing returns to us the joy of the bath.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The joy of the bath can be lost through the defilement of the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Only foot-washing can recover for us this joy of the bath.</S>
