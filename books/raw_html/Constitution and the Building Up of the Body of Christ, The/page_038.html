<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Renewing of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Going along with His regeneration God has renewed us by the germination of His Holy Spirit to have a new beginning in His new creation (Titus 3:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Complete Salvation of God</H2><P>The salvation of God mentioned in Romans 1:16 comprises all the different aspects in the full salvation of God, which is very basic to the believers' growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Salvation of God in the Life of Christ</H2><P>The complete and full salvation of God comprises one particular aspect, that is, to save us by the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10b) in all the matters of our daily life in the entire course of our Christian life, especially in regenerating, transforming, conforming, and glorifying us. This is the crucial base for us to grow in the divine life, which is Christ Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Putting Us into Christ</H2><P>In God's complete and full salvation, the all-inclusive item is God's putting us into Christ in an organic union with Him, making Him our life, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, and every positive thing (1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 3:4). This is the all-inclusive base to our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Identification with Christ<br>in His Death, Resurrection, and Ascension</H2><P>Our identification with Christ in His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension (Rom. 6:3-6; Eph. 2:6), making His story our history, is also a crucial base to our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. The Abounding Grace of God</H2><P>In addition to all the above items, Paul in his writings assures us of the abounding, multiplying grace of God (Rom. 5:20), which is the grace of Christ that is sufficient to meet all our needs in our Christian life (2 Cor. 12:9) and leads us to reign in life in Christ (Rom. 5:21). Such an abounding grace is needed as a base for our growth in the divine life.</P>
