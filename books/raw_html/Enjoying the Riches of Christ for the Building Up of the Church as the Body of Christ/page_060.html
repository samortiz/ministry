<h2 class=head2>Recovering the Genuine Oneness by Dropping Everything Other Than Christ</h2><p>The Lord’s recovery today is the recovery of the genuine oneness, the oneness of Christ. The Lord is going to recover us out of the teachings, out of the gifts, and out of the opinions back to Himself. In Christ we have oneness. Hallelujah for Christ! Do not talk to me about the gifts, teachings, or mere opinions, and do not ask me for my opinion. I have only one opinion, that is Christ. To only care for Christ is the way to be one.<p>How can we keep the oneness? It is by dropping the doctrines and giving up the gifts. If you have the gift of healing, would you give it up? We have to give it up. Otherwise, the gift of healing will become a dividing factor. This does not mean that we never use the gift of healing. Sometimes, we may use it, but we are not for the gift; we are only for Christ.<p>Sometimes people have come to argue with me about particular matters, but I have no desire to argue. If someone asks me whether or not we should have tambourines in the meetings, I have no opinion. If the sisters like to play the tambourine, they can play many tambourines at once and I will not be bothered. Some saints, however, may be so bothered that they cannot come to a meeting with tambourines. If this is the case, they are right away divided. Let me ask you, “To what kind of meeting would you go?” Perhaps, you may need to take a “church tour,” traveling through so many so-called churches in order to find a place that fits your taste. However, if it is suitable to your taste, it may not be suitable to others’ taste, so eventually we all become divided. How can we keep the oneness in this way?<p>The Lord today is recovering the oneness. All the divisions are a shame to the Lord Jesus, and they are a real boast to the enemy. But if we today care for the oneness, this is a shame to the enemy. Even if we have only a small number, we still can boast to the enemy, saying, “Satan, look at us. We have all come out of every kind of background. Now we are truly one. Satan, you caused people to say that there is no possibility for Christians to be one. But now here we are; we are one.” Right away Satan will be put to shame and will be cast out. The oneness is a real shame to Satan. We can boast, “Satan, we are one. We do not have natural friendship; rather, we are one in Christ, by Christ, with Christ, and for Christ.”<p>We need to be attuned by Christ and with Christ, not caring for anything else. Forty years ago, if I saw guitar playing in a meeting, I would have done my best to stop it. Recently in New Zealand, however, I was in a meeting with fewer than sixty people but many guitars, and in addition to the guitars there were also tambourines. I was happy with all the instruments. In that meeting nothing bothered us. We were all one.<h2 class=head1>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</h2><p>Ephesians 4:3 says, “Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.” The oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself. The Spirit Himself is our oneness. We should care not for doctrines or for gifts but for the Spirit. The book of Ephesians does not emphasize doctrines or gifts because, as Paul says, they are childish things (v. 14). Rather, we all have to know Christ and His Body and care for the oneness of the Spirit. The real oneness is one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God (vv. 4-6). Do not care for the teachings, and do not care for the gifts. Only care for the oneness. Today under the confusion of Christianity, it is not easy for us to be one. We need the Lord’s grace to be emancipated from every kind of division.
