TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE&mdash;<br />
CREATING MAN AS A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Background</h2>
<p>The first step that God took in fulfilling His purpose was to create man. Genesis 2:4-7 says, &ldquo;These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. When Jehovah God made earth and heaven, and no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up&mdash;for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground, but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground&mdash;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; Why does this portion begin by saying that nothing had sprung up from the earth because Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth? Why does it say that there was no man to work the ground but that a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground? Why are these things mentioned before God&rsquo;s creation of man? This portion provides the background of God&rsquo;s creation of man.</p>
<p>We need to maintain a principle when reading Genesis 2. This chapter can be compared to a detailed painting. Therefore, we should not consider merely the literal meaning of the words in this chapter; rather, we should ponder the implied meaning in order to understand this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being No Rain upon the Earth</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says that before God created man &ldquo;no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up.&rdquo; However, according to chapter 1, the plant life, such as grass and herbs, were already growing (vv. 11-12). Why does chapter 2 say, &ldquo;No herb of the field had yet sprung up&rdquo;? We must understand the implied meaning in this portion. The spiritual implication of this portion is that before man was created, the life of God could not grow out of the earth. In order for the life of God to grow out of the earth, the creation of man was needed. Hence, God created man so that His life could grow out of the earth.</p>
<p>Verse 5 also says, &ldquo;Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth.&rdquo; <em>Rain</em> here also has an implied meaning. Joel 2:23 says that Jehovah gives the children of Israel the early rain and makes rain to come down for them. Then verse 28 says that God will pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. These verses show that rain in the Bible signifies the Spirit poured out from God. The Spirit of God descends from heaven just as rain descends from heaven. The rain that descends from heaven to earth has two issues. On the one hand, it mingles with the dust of the earth; on the other hand, life grows out of this mingling. Both issues have a spiritual meaning.</p>
<p>Before man was created, rain did not come down from heaven. This means that before there was a man on the earth, the Spirit of God did not come to mingle with anything on the earth. Before man was created, there was nothing on the earth with which the rain from heaven could be mingled. This situation changed after God created man, because there was a living creature on the earth, the man formed of dust, with whom the Spirit of God, the rain descending from heaven, could be mingled. From that point on, the life of God could grow out from such a mingling.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being No Man to Work the Ground</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:5 also says, &ldquo;There was no man to work the ground.&rdquo; This means that not only had the Spirit of God not yet descended but also that there was no man to cooperate and work together with God in order for the life of God to grow out of the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Mist Going Up from the Earth</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;A mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.&rdquo; This means that before God created man, nothing on the earth was mingled with something that descended from heaven. Everything on the earth was out of the earth. These three points&mdash;no rain upon the earth, no man working the ground, and a mist going up from the earth&mdash;are the background of God&rsquo;s creation of man.</p>
<p>With this background God created man. After man was created, God was afforded an opportunity to send something from heaven to mingle with the things on the earth. Therefore, verse 7 subsequently says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.&rdquo; The breath of life can be considered as the first drop of rain that descended from heaven to the earth in order to mingle with the dust of the earth and produce life. This life was like God and was in His image. According to the spiritual implication, we may say that at this point the life of God began to grow out of the earth. We must try our best to understand these matters.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Desire and Purpose in Creation &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
