<h2 class=head3>Continuing to Know This Eternal Christ by the Inner Life until Maturity</h2><p>First John 2:13 says, “…fathers…have known Him who is from the beginning.” The verb “have known” is in the present perfect tense. It indicates that the condition is continuing. The fathers have already known this enjoyable Christ by the inner life. Now they are continuing to know Him. This knowing is not once for all. Rather, it is a continuous knowing that reaches maturity.<h2 class=head2>The Lord’s Achievement in Grace</h2><p>Both the young and the middle-aged saints, as well as the saints who are the fathers, are what they are today because of the achievement of the Lord’s grace. The Lord’s gracious achievement is manifested in the time, the place, and the circumstances where we are. It is also manifested in the grace we have experienced and in the church life we have been put into. You can imagine that if you had not been born in this age and in this place, with the Lord’s special provision in the environment, you might not have been saved. Our salvation is truly of the sovereignty of God. When I was young, I often worshipped the Lord for my salvation. He caused me to be born in the province of Shantung in China in the twentieth century. That was a place that the Western missionaries frequently visited. My mother was a third-generation Christian church member. I was even put into a Christian school. For every one of these points, I thank the Lord.<p>It is not uncommon for a person to be weak after he is saved. But in His recovery the Lord is especially gracious among us. The words released are rich, and the truth shines brightly. In addition, the church is like an orchard where life grows. The brothers and sisters are like fruit trees, growing day by day in this orchard. Some have been in this orchard from the time they were in the children’s meeting. They have grown from being toddlers to become the elders serving in the church. Hence, in time, in place, in circumstance, in grace, and in the church, the grace of the Lord has nurtured and perfected us. Today, the church is full of young and middle-aged saints and has many fathers also. God’s present need is for these two groups. If they are present, the new way will succeed. Without them, the new way will have problems. I do not say that it will fail, for God cannot fail. If He cannot get through in you, He will get through in someone else. Sooner or later, He will get through.<h2 class=head1>IN THE PAST, THERE BEING MANY MEN AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES, WHEREAS NOW, THERE BEING MANY OPPORTUNITIES AND FEW MEN</h2><p>Three and a half years ago, there were those who wanted to serve in the church in Taipei, but the opportunities were few. Now the opportunities are too many. However, there are few who serve. At present, there are approximately ten thousand saints who monthly attend the home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings. In addition to this group, there are about ten thousand dormant ones. Furthermore, since we began in 1986 preaching the gospel by knocking on doors, there are twenty-five thousand others who have not yet been brought in. If we add these dormant ones and the ones who have not yet been brought in, there are thirty-five thousand who need care. Who is going to care for them? In addition to the needs of these people, the home meetings, the small group meetings, the district meetings, and all the other meetings have their doors wide open. The opportunities are there waiting. Hence, now there are many opportunities and few men.
