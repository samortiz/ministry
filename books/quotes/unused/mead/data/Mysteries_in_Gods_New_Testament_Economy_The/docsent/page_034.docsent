   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE The Law of the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Key to the Mysterious Organism</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in God's New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message, the most important thing to realize is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now let us consider the outline point by point.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, the law of the Spirit of life is the key to the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy is a matter of Christ being our life Col 3:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With life, there is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the law of life, what we have is just outward regulations and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses were not the law of life, but were laws in the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were there to regulate man and to expose man's real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the law of the Spirit of life that we talk about is a life-law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The life in this life-law is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is life, and in His life there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the life of Christ is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy depends on the Spirit of life as the law Rom 8:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the law and the Spirit of life are not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, the law is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, this law of the Spirit of life is the key to Christ being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the revelation of the Bible, on the one hand, the Spirit of life denotes Christ, because Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, it denotes the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit of life is the consummated Spirit, who is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the whole universe, the highest and greatest law is one in which the Triune God is the law, because the Triune God is the highest, richest, and best life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no other life that is higher and better than the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, there is no other law that is higher and better than the Triune God as law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, this law of the Spirit of life in us is tremendous, for this law is just the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What Romans 8:2-13 talks about is actually this law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 2 tells us in plain words that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After this it talks about the processed Triune God working Himself into us, the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, He enters into our spirit to make our spirit life v. 10 . Next, He saturates our mind, so that our mind also becomes life v. 6 . Finally, He permeates our bodies from the soul to which our mind belongs, giving life to our mortal bodies v. 11 . The purpose of the Triune God dispensing Himself into our whole being in this way is not merely to be life but to be a law.</S>
