   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TODAY A. Committing Oneself to the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I see clearly that with our present condition, we need a second salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The term "handing over" is only our borrowed term.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not wish that it be taken by others and used as a standard terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, man was rebellious, individual, and unwilling to hand himself over.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now through the work of the Lord, he is willing to drop everything and to hand himself over voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, if a man wants to hand himself over willingly, he has to do it; and if he does not want to hand himself over, he nevertheless has to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some may think that they cannot hand themselves over, but they should go ahead and try it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once a sacrifice is on the altar, the altar will sanctify the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is like some people saying that they cannot believe and that they have too many questions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But once they decide to believe, all their questions are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person can believe even though he has many doubts and questions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as a person is willing, God can work on him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a man thinks that he cannot hand himself over, all he has to do is to place himself in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church will help him to become able.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If one individual has some problem, he can ask for help from the church; a few others can come along to help him to hand himself over.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, as long as man makes a little move, God will move along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The handing over that we speak of today is not an individual handing over, but a handing over that is done in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such handing over is a kind of committing of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It may seem that a person is only putting himself on the altar on a trial basis, and it may seem that God is only accepting such a one on a trial basis.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, whether or not a man considers his move a trial effort, God takes it up seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He takes up those who do it whole-heartedly, and He also takes up those who do it half-heartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, when we hand ourselves over, we are committing ourselves to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body is our greatest protection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the coming days, we shall see that those who do not live in the Body will suffer great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The supply of the ministry is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we are separated from the Body, we are cut off from the supply of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. Realizing the Supply of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The book of Acts indicates that when Paul was in Athens, he was provoked in his spirit and was ill at ease Acts 17:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet when Timothy joined him in Corinth, he immediately received the supply Acts 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is like a certain brother passing by your locality, or a new one joining your meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Immediately, you can feel the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes, when a few brothers visit a locality, supply follows them wherever they go.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers may not even need to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All they have to do is to sit there, and the supply is there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times, as long as there is the proper audience, a speaker will be able to release his burden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The thing that causes the most suffering is for a person to come with a burden and to go home with the same burden on him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since we are a Body, we affect one another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we are not very clear how we affect one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes we feel that our fellowship with the Lord is particularly intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At other times, we have some inexplicable feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason for these phenomena is that there exists a supply in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the Body life there is a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This supply is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we do not know how this supply affects the members.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Body, we should not be a brother or sister who consumes others' supply; we should have a clear realization of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All our failures and weakenings today are due to the fact that we behave as individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are some things that we cannot explain very clearly today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the days ahead, perhaps there will be the opportunity for us to speak about them in a clearer and more precise way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, many Christians were martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the same time that this was going on, many churches around the world had the feeling that something was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people were depressed in their spirit for many days, and they felt the need for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This feeling was not something that came from the physical eyes or the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was a feeling of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Who can say that the faithful martyrs were not supplied during those hours by the effect of these prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Miss Barber was in England at that time, and she was oppressed in her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She felt the need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Soon after that, she found out what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever one part of our body becomes sick, the other parts of the body will come to the sick member's aid and will try to deal with the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the same way, there is a supply in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Body life is not a term, but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many people think that the church is only a mysterious and abstract Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They do not realize that this Body is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First Corinthians 11:29 mentions the discerning of "the body."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Body denotes two things: the Lord's Body, and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here it only mentions the body, without making reference to either the Lord's Body or the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, on the one hand, it refers to the Lord's Body, whereas, on the other hand, to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Within this Body, there are the riches of the Lord, and there are the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every Christian can receive the benefits of the Holy Spirit and of the Lord's grace in this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The greatest lack among Christians today is the supply of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May the Lord open our eyes to see this Body and to realize the supply in this Body.</S>
