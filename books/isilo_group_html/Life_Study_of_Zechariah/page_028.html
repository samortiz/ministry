Each Chariot Being Equipped with Horses</H2><P>"With the first chariot were red horses, and with the second chariot were black horses, and with the third chariot were white horses, and with the fourth chariot were strong, speckled horses" (6:2-3). That each chariot was equipped with horses signifies the quick movement of God's judgment. From our point of view, God's judgment may be slow in coming. However, according to God's view, His judgment comes swiftly with a quick movement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Horses of Different Colors</H2><P>These horses of different colors, red, black, white, and speckled, signify the different manners of God's judgment.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus comes, He will be swifter than the wind; He will be like lightning. The last wind will bring in Christ as the last, the consummating, Craftsman, who will destroy Antichrist with his kingdom and tread the great winepress. In an instant He will crush the great human image (Dan. 2) from the toes to the head, terminating the entire human government on this earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Significance of the Two Mountains</H2><P>Zechariah 6:1 speaks of two mountains. These two mountains signify a testimony of God's judgments on the earth. From between the two mountains, the four winds come forth to testify to the whole earth that God is on the throne and that the earth is under His administration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Significance of the Mountains of Brass</H2><P>"The mountains were mountains of brass" (v. 1b). In typology brass signifies judgment. Thus, these two mountains of brass signify mountains of judgment. God's judgment comes to carry out His testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. These Who Are Going Forth<br>to the Land of the North Giving Rest<br>to God's Spirit in the Land of the North</H2><P>"Then He called out to me and spoke to me, saying, See, these who are going forth to the land of the north have given My Spirit rest in the land of the north" (v. 8). This signifies that the judgments on the countries of the north, Assyria and Babylon (Jer. 1:14-15; 4:6; 6:1; 25:9; 46:10; Ezek. 1:4), have given rest to God's Spirit. The judgment on these countries was a comfort to God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Zechariah &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
