   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO THE GOLDEN INCENSE ALTAR 6 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:6-10; 40:5, 26-27; Psa 84:3; 141:2; Rev 8:3-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have gone to the altar of burnt offering, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, we arrive at the golden altar of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we come to this altar, our unique taste, our only interest, is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ONE WITH CHRIST IN INTERCESSION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What kind of prayers shall we offer at the incense altar?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Shall we pray private prayers or personal prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No, the prayer we offer at the incense altar will be intercessory prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we open our mouth to pray at the incense altar, the prayer that will issue forth will not be personal, individual prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It will be intercessory prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we no longer have any interest in ourselves or in our welfare.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of considering ourselves and praying for ourselves, we intercede for others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time we shall be in our experience a real member of Christ, a genuine part of the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, that will be the time when we cooperate with Christ in His ministry of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He intercedes in a particular way, and we cooperate with Him in His way of interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we carry out His intercession in our prayers of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we are truly one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE DESTINATION OF THE DIVINE TOUR</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the altar of burnt offering in the outer court there is a particular kind of depth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are other depths at the table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, concerning the tabernacle and the outer court, there are at least five kinds of depths.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the sight of God, the reason that not many believers today are praying at the incense altar is that they have not experienced all these depths.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have pointed out, many may pray at the first altar, but few are interceding at the second.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to pray at the second altar, we must first experience the altar of burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our experience of this altar, we need to have a full realization concerning the blood and the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we must go on to experience the bread on the table, the bread that signifies Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this, we proceed to the lampstand, which signifies Christ as our light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following that, we go to the ark, which signifies Christ as God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This testimony is versus our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we have experienced the first altar, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, we may come to the incense altar and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we arrive at the incense altar, we should stay here longer than at any other place in the outer court or the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we need to pray again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This golden altar of incense is the destination of the divine tour.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tour begins at the altar in the outer court, passes through the table, the lampstand, and the ark, and stops at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because the divine tour stops here, we need to stay here to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where are you when you pray?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may say that you are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, this answer is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need to specify a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where do you stay when you are in God?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you remain at the table?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Or do you remain at the lampstand or at the ark?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very good that we spend time at the table, the lampstand, and the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we should not remain at these places, because they are not our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our destination is the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because the incense altar is our destination, once we arrive there we should remain and continue there in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After you have more experience, you will understand more fully what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then according to your experience, you will say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will declare, After passing through the first altar, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, I am now at the incense altar interceding for God s interests, for the churches, and for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we remain at the incense altar, then in Christ and with Christ we shall have something that ascends to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is our prayer.</S>
