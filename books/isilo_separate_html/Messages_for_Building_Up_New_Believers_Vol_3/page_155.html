between the Living and the Dead</h2>
<p>According to Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and Leviticus 20:6, God strictly forbids the living to communicate with the dead. In the Gospel of Luke, the Lord spoke about the rich man in Hades, who implored the Lord to send Lazarus to the land of the living, yet the Lord would not do it. Dead people are in Hades or in Paradise, and they cannot return to the land of the living. For a dead man to return to the land of the living or for the living to communicate with the dead is to engage in divination. The Bible strictly forbids this.</p>
<p>A diviner or a witch is a woman who communicates with demons. A woman can actually be acquainted with only one demon. Such a woman is familiar with evil spirits. In divination a demon pretends to be the spirit of many dead persons. The one with whom a diviner communicates is not actually the spirit of the dead person, but the demon himself. In the Bible only 1 Samuel speaks of a spirit coming up from Hades. After Samuel died, his spirit was called up, and he rebuked Saul (1 Sam. 28). The one place that speaks of the reason for Saul&rsquo;s death is 1 Chronicles 10:13-14, which says that Saul died because he took counsel from one who had a familiar spirit. The laws of Moses forbade a woman from communicating with spirits, and those who did so were to be stoned to death. Anyone who engages in divination is a heretic.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Concerning Women Teaching</h2>
<p>First Timothy 2, 1 Corinthians 14, and Revelation 2 all show that God forbids a woman from teaching. Any sect that is started by a woman or headed up by one, or any group in which the woman occupies the same place as the man is highly suspicious. More than half of the heresies in the world have been started by women. For example, the founder of the Christian Scientists was Mary Baker Eddy, and the founder of the Seventh-day Adventists was Mrs. White. When the Bible speaks about Roman Catholicism, it also refers to the teaching of the woman Jezebel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Concerning the Lord&rsquo;s Coming</h2>
<p>The principle of heresy is a Satanic imitation of what the Lord is doing. For example, the Lord heals sicknesses. Satan also heals sicknesses. Concerning the Lord&rsquo;s coming, heresies try to confuse men. For example, some claim that the Lord will come on a certain day in a certain place. When the Lord does not come as predicted, men begin to ignore or despise the very truth concerning the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. Satan likes to smear the truth concerning the Lord&rsquo;s coming with such infamous incidents. It is true that the Lord is coming soon, and many people will pay more attention to prophecies in the future. For this reason, more heresies will be found in the area of prophecies. If any sect or group claims that it is waiting for the Lord to return on a certain date in a certain place, you can tell immediately that this is a heretical group. If anyone claims that he is one of the two witnesses, or one of the three angels, do not believe him. If anyone claims to be a certain person described in the Bible, do not trust him. The Lord says that one day men will claim, &ldquo;Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here!&rdquo; (Matt. 24:23). Do not believe them. These are lies.</p>
<p>We should not put our trust in anything. The only thing we should pursue is to be the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3. Others may say that they are certain persons described in the book of Revelation or the book of Daniel. They are heretics, and we should not receive them. In the end times heresies will increase. This is why we have to discern. Do not be curious to try them out. Such curiosity will always cause damage to our spirit. If we try them out, we are tasting poison. If anyone does not pass any of the above ten tests, he is a heretic, and we must not have any fellowship with him. These teachings are rising up day by day in China, and we have to be on the alert against them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_154.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
