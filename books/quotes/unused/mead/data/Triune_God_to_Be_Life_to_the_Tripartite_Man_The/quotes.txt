[2]  And Do You Think that You Have the Spirit of God?
[3]  God as food to man indicates that man is dependent upon God.
[4]  I have often thought that it would be wonderful if God had created us so that we needed to eat only one time for our entire life.
[5]  The significance of man's fall is that man was estranged from the life of God Eph 4:17-19 , signified by the tree of life.
[6]  When the tree of life is mentioned in Genesis 2, the emphasis is on the tree itself, not on its fruit.
[7]  CHAPTER TWO THE THOUGHT OF GOD TO BE MAN'S LIFE
[8]  REVELATION FROM BEGINNING TO END 2 Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16, 4; 14:6a; 11:25a; 10:10b; 1 John 5:11-12; John 10:11, 15b, 17-18a, 28a; 3:14-15; Heb 7:16; John 19:34; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 3:16, 36a; 20:31 THE THOUGHT OF GOD TO BE MAN'S LIFE
[9]  God's Putting Man before the Tree of Life Indicating that God Desires
[10]  The tree of life Gen 2:8-9 is a symbol of God as life.
[11]  to Partake of God as the Fountain of Life
[12]  Christ redeemed us back to our original position so that we can enter into God and enjoy Him as our life.
[13]  God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;
[14]  Christ came as life that man may have life and have it abundantly John 14:6a; 11:25a; 10:10b; 1 John 5:11-12 .
[15]  Through His death on the cross, Christ accomplished God's redemption and released His divine life.
[16]  REVELATION FROM BEGINNING TO END 3 Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; 1:13; 1 Pet 1:23; James 1:18; 1 Pet 1:3; John 1:12; Heb 2:10; 2 Pet 1:4; Rom 8:30c IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[17]  Through His death on the cross, Christ accomplished God's redemption, signified by the shedding of His blood, and released His divine life, signified by the flowing of water out of Him John 19:34 .
[18]  In the fifth step of His coming, Christ, as the last Adam, became the life-giving, life-dispensing Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b through His resurrection.
[19]  Now, whoever believes into Him may have the eternal, divine life John 3:16, 36a; 20:31 .
[20]  After God came in incarnation that we may have Him as life, God in Christ as the Spirit enters the believers in Christ to be their life through regenerating them John 3:5-6; 1:13 .
[21]  The phrase God in Christ as the Spirit indicates the Triune God.
[22]  First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead."
[23]  It is for us to be partakers of the divine nature that we were made children of God and sons of God that we may be glorified with the divine glory 2 Pet 1:4; Rom 8:30c; Heb 2:10 .
[24]  REVELATION FROM BEGINNING TO END 4 Scripture Reading: Col 3:4a; Gal 2:20a; 2 Tim 4:22; Col 3:10-11; Dan 2:34-35, 44; Matt 19:28; Rev 20:4-6; 2:7, 26; 12:5; Matt 25:34, 46b; Rev 21:1-2, 10-11; 22:1-2, 5b; 21:24 CHRIST AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[25]  After God's coming, God enters into us to regenerate us, to make us His children, His sons, that we may be partakers of the divine nature.
[26]  To Be All the Members of the New Man
[27]  Christ lives in us to be all the members of the new man Col 3:10-11 .
[28]  Christ is the element of the new man, and the very God who is in Christ is the essence of the new man.
[29]  The interpretation of the image in Daniel 2 is a prophecy concerning the human governments from the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, until the time of the coming of Christ see pp.
[30]  25-26 of The Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ to Be the Organism of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God, published by Living Stream Ministry .
[31]  The overcoming believers in Christ will inherit the eternal life as a reward to them in the millennium Matt 19:28-29; Rev 20:4-6 .
[32]  The overcoming believers will be kings to rule in the eternal life over the nations who will remain on the earth in the realm of the eternal life the enlarged kingdom of God in the millennium Rev 20:4, 6; 2:26; 12:5; Matt 25:34, 46b .
[33]  In the Eternal Age Christ Being Life to All God's Redeemed,
[34]  In the eternal age, in the new heaven and new earth, Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God will be life, symbolized by the tree of life growing in the river of water of life, to all God's redeemed Rev 21:1-2, 10-11; 22:1-2 .
[35]  The Triune God took several crucial steps in being processed to be the life-giving Spirit.
[36]  The Lord Jesus was crucified in order to accomplish the all-inclusive death for redemption John 1:29; 1 Cor 15:3b; Heb 2:14b; John 3:14; 12:31-33; Gal 6:14; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20a; 5:24; John 12:24 .
[37]  The Lord Jesus died an all-inclusive death, and His death dealt with six main negative items: sin including sins John 1:29; 1 Cor 15:3b , Satan Heb 2:14b; John 3:14 , the world John 12:31-33; Gal 6:14 , the old man Rom 6:6 , the flesh Gal 5:24 , and the "I" Gal 2:20a , which includes our natural life.
[38]  As such a compound Spirit, He is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2a .
[39]  The ingredients of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have been compounded together in this one Spirit.
[40]  Now, this Spirit is the Spirit of life, waiting to be received and contained by the tripartite man.
[41]  When we exercise our spirit, immediately the compound Spirit, who is the Spirit of life and the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , enters into our spirit, imparting the divine life into us.
[42]  The tripartite man was created with a spirit to be the receiver and container of the divine life Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27 .
[43]  The study of theology began in the second century and has been progressing from one stage to another stage.
[44]  It began with the study of the Trinity and the person of Christ.
[45]  After the initial advance made by the mystics such as Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon, mysticism was further developed by William Law.
[46]  He made mysticism practical, but his improvement of mysticism was not that complete.
[47]  Then Andrew Murray continued after William Law to improve the understanding of the inner life.
[48]  As God's redeemed people created by God as tripartite persons, we are to be saved in the divine life of Christ who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God Rom 5:10b .
[49]  We are saved in the divine life of Christ by the release of the law of the consummated Spirit from the bondage, the slavery, of sin, the law of sin Rom 8:2 .
[50]  To be saved in the divine life of Christ is something which is progressive.
[51]  To be sanctified is to be made holy by being separated from the present age of the world.
[52]  To love the world is to love to be modern.
[53]  We may think that we are holy, but we must ask whether or not the way we comb our hair or the way we dress ourselves is modern.
[54]  In order to be saved, we need to be separated unto God by being sanctified by the consummated Spirit through our cooperation by not being conformed to this age Rom 12:2a .
[55]  When we are saved in the divine life by being released, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and transfigured, we can reign in the divine life Rom 5:17 .
[56]  The three basic factors in experiencing the divine life are Christ, the Spirit, and the cross.
[57]  Christ as the object of our experience of the divine life is all-inclusive Col 3:11 .
[58]  He is our temple Rev 21:22 , our Passover 1 Cor 5:7 , and our feast v. 8 . He is even our real soil.
[59]  We have been planted into Christ 1 Cor 3:6 , and we have been rooted and are being built up in Him Col 2:7 .
[60]  Christ is all the divine attributes and all the human virtues.
[61]  As our life, Christ abides in our spirit John 15:5; 2 Tim 4:22 to live in us in our daily life Gal 2:20 , operate in us in our labor for Him Col 1:29 , empower us in spiritual fighting Eph 6:10 , and strengthen us in spiritual living Phil 4:13 .
[62]  As the Spirit, Christ is one with our spirit 1 Cor 6:17 to mingle Himself with us that we may be one with Him, even one with the Triune God.
[63]  AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Matt 1:20-23; 18:20; 28:20; John 14:16-20; 2 Tim 4:22; Gal 5:25a; 2:20; 5:16; Phil 1:20-21; Gal 5:22-23; 2 Pet 1:5-8; Phil 2:14; Gal 5:25b; 1 Cor 14:3-5; Eph 4:11-12; 1 John 2:15, 17; Rom 12:2; Matt 16:24; Eph 4:24; Rom 12:5; Eph 1:23; Gal 6:15; Phil 3:12-16; Eph 4:15-16; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rev 22:17a; 2 Tim 4:22
[64]  The entire book of Matthew deals with the Triune God being with the tripartite man.
[65]  It reveals that the presence of Jesus is Immanuel Matt 1:21, 23; 18:20; 28:20 .
[66]  The Triune God passed through the processes of incarnation and resurrection in order to dispense Himself into us.
[67]  Through incarnation He could be Immanuel outside of His believers, but this would fulfill only part of His intention in being with us.
[68]  Living with Christ is not I living alone but with Christ living in me Gal 2:20 .
[69]  In the New Testament, the word became is used twice concerning Christ.
[70]  First, the Word who is God became flesh John 1:1, 14 .
[71]  The eternal God, Jehovah, the Triune God, the Creator and Upholder of the entire universe, became flesh.
[72]  The Gospel of John shows that Immanuel went through a process to become the life-giving Spirit.
[73]  We live by Him as the life-giving Spirit.
[74]  Most Christians understand the first aspect of our Christian walk, but few Christians understand or have any idea that the Christian walk has a second aspect.
[75]  As Christians we not only live to express Christ, we also live to accomplish a definite purpose.
[76]  Walking by the Life-giving Spirit The Life-giving Spirit
[77]  In Exodus 3 He unveiled Himself as Jehovah, the One who was, who is, and who always shall be v. 14 . The eternal Triune God, Jehovah, had to be processed through several steps to be a life-giving Spirit.
[78]  This life-giving Spirit is Christ in resurrection, the pneumatic Christ, the Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God transformed in resurrection to be the consummated Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rev 22:17a .
[79]  This consummated Spirit is the Lord, the pneumatic Christ, the Christ in resurrection, who was the complete God as a perfect man, passing through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit in order to live in our spirit, not only as a power or a means to strengthen us, to support us, to help us, but also as a complete person of divinity and humanity to be our life that we may live God's divine life mingled with our human life.
[80]  After branching Himself into humanity through incarnation, God did many things, but His main achievement was the cross.
[81]  Today we are blessed because we are in the age of the God-man, the cross, and the life-giving Spirit.
[82]  Between the God-man and the life-giving Spirit is the cross, the greatest matter in the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose.
[83]  Christ is the God-man and the life-giving Spirit.
[84]  Christ as the God-man, the achievement of His cross, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit are three bequests in the New Testament.
[85]  The life that we live together with Christ is a grafted life Rom 11:24; 6:5 .
[86]  We are joined with Christ and live together with Christ.
[87]  MESSAGE ELEVEN THE PRACTICAL WAY TO BEAR THE CROSS Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20a; Rom 6:6a; Gal 5:24; Rom 8:13b; 2 Cor 4:10; 1 Cor 6:7b INCARNATION, CRUCIFIXION, AND RESURRECTION
[88]  OF BEING CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST Our Being Crucified with Christ
[89]  In our experience, we must learn to enjoy Christ as Immanuel through the life-giving Spirit, and we must also learn to apply the cross.
[90]  THE PRACTICAL WAY TO BEAR THE CROSS To Realize That We Have Been
[91]  Bearing the cross is expressed in being willing to be wronged or defrauded 1 Cor 6:7b .
[92]  To bear the cross in a fine way is to "live within the Cross's shadow."
[93]  In 1 Corinthians 1:18 Paul said, "For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
[94]  Adam's death is the way to death; Christ's death is the way to life 1 Cor 15:21-22 .
[95]  If you die in Adam, you go into death, but if you die with Christ, you go into life.
[96]  We live in resurrection, not by ourselves but by Christ replacing us.
[97]  MESSAGE THIRTEEN DYING TO SELF AND LIVING TO GOD Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24; Rom 7:17-18, 11, 13; 1 Pet 2:24m; Gal 2:19; Rom 16:26; Psa 36:9a; Col 2:9; 2 Cor 3:17-18, 6b; Phil 1:19b, 20b-21a; 4:8
[98]  Many Christians consider that the Bible tells us that men should be good to one another and that men must learn to fear God, please God, and behave before God.
[99]  Although this is a common concept concerning the Bible, it is not completely accurate.
[100]  First, we are living to die; then we are dying to live.
[101]  If we die to ourselves, we will surely live to God.
[102]  MESSAGE FOURTEEN WHAT KIND OF SPIRIT ARE YOU OF?
[103]  In Luke 9 James and John asked the Lord whether or not they should tell fire to come down from heaven and consume the village of the Samaritans who had rejected Him v. 54 . But the Lord rebuked James and John, saying, "You do not know what kind of spirit you are of" v. 55, see note Recovery Version . This indicates that whenever we are about to do anything, we should ask ourselves, "What kind of spirit are we of?"
[104]  In Psalm 51:12 David said to the Lord, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit" ASV .
[105]  As a believer we should always have a willing spirit for the things of the Lord and for the things of the church.
[106]  We need to have a willing spirit and be filled with the Spirit of God in order to practice the God-ordained way to meet and to serve.
[107]  In the past in the recovery, we paid attention to many crucial things, but we did not pay attention to the New Testament way to meet and to serve.
[108]  There are four steps in the practice of the new way: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and building up.
[109]  Every proper believer should always have two or three new believers under his care year-round.
[110]  These two or three new believers would come from your visiting people with the gospel.
[111]  MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE SPIRIT OF REALITY Scripture Reading: John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 7:39; Matt 28:19b; Phil 1:19; Rev 22:17; John 14:16-20; Rom 8:17b
[112]  The study of the Divine Trinity and the person of Christ began in the second century.
[113]  In church history certain terms were invented in order to describe the relationship between the three of the Divine Trinity.
[114]  The term essential Trinity describes the oneness which exists among the three of the Divine Trinity.
[115]  The consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God is the reality of the processed Triune God.
[116]  In this message we want to see the three particular capacities of the divine life: the fellowship of life, the light of life, and the sense of life.
[117]  According to 1 John 1:5-7 the fellowship of life brings us into the presence of God.
[118]  In our daily life, we may respond merely to outward regulations or to others who are observing us, but we have to realize that the Lord is observing us more closely than anyone.
[119]  The fellowship of the divine life revealed in the New Testament is abstract, mysterious, and very difficult to define.
[120]  The reality of the divine fellowship is one of the most neglected things among the believers.
[121]  A saint who has a proper living and who is victorious is one who is always in the divine fellowship, vertically and horizontally, all day long.
[122]  We must learn to fellowship with the Lord more, and we must also learn to fellowship with the saints more.
[123]  We must thank the Lord for those around us, and we must endeavor to have fellowship with them.
[124]  BY THE TWO SPIRITS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:14; 2 Tim 4:22; Phil 2:1; Rev 1:10
[125]  Hymn #737 in Hymns speaks of the fellowship of life and its relationship to the Spirit and the cross.
[126]  There is a great lack of the experience of the divine fellowship in today's Christianity.
[127]  For this reason, hardly anything is spoken concerning the fellowship of the divine life.
[128]  Mostly, people preach the gospel by telling people that when they are saved, they will go to heaven after they die.
[129]  We need to enter into the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship by the human spirit Phil 2:1; Rev 1:10 .
[130]  Those who were saved in Acts 2 were brought into and continued steadfastly in the apostles' fellowship v. 42 . Later in the New Testament, the divine fellowship is called the fellowship of the Father and of His Son 1 John 1:3 , the fellowship of the Holy Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 , and the fellowship of spirit Phil 2:1 .
[131]  OF THE TWO SPIRITS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 2:1; Lev 14:6-10, 14-18; Gal 2:20a; Acts 16:6-10; 1 Cor 1:18, 24-25; 2:2 Hymns: #279, #631 THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TWO SPIRITS
[132]  This fellowship has two aspects the vertical aspect by the Holy Spirit between us and the Triune God and the horizontal aspect by the human spirit among us believers.
[133]  In our experience, however, there are always frustrations and obstacles between us and God.
[134]  The divine fellowship is the dispensing of the Triune God into us, the tripartite men, making us and God one.
[135]  The grace of Christ means that Christ is grace, the love of God means that God is love, and the fellowship of the Spirit means that the Spirit is the fellowship.
[136]  I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live but Christ lives in me.
