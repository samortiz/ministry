<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Baguio City, Philippines, in April 1955. In the conference Brother Lee spoke concerning chapters 5 through 7, 13, and 24 through 25 of the Gospel of Matthew. However, detailed records of only the speaking concerning chapters 5 through 7 exist. These messages were originally published in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> in 1959.</p>
