Thank you for letting us know how you are doing in Shanghai. We really thank the Lord for loving us so much and giving us His Word. Thank the Lord that we have gained much help and strength. It is really marvelous that the Lord gave Brother Pi Chen a word from two places, but it was still the same word. Not many days after we received your letter, Brother David Hsu in Ningpo also sent a letter with the same word. It really strengthened Brother Pi Chen and made him bolder.</p><p>Brother, you know how weak he is. We can only ask you to remember him in your prayer so that God's grace and power can be expressed in him.</p><p>We should have answered your letter sooner. Many brothers and sisters were coming and going, and they needed rides to and from the station; there were also many other small matters that took up all our time, so we must ask you to forgive us. Brother Pi Chen will go to Mou Pin to visit the brothers on the third day after the Chinese New Year. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>We could not rent the hall on West Road. Some of the brothers suggested we make a big tent that could be moved any time to any place. We are still praying about it. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Chao Ching Hai, Chao Pi Chen</p><h2 class="head2">Four</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to Brother Witness:</p><p>We received all the letters you sent us. Thank you very much. I really thank the Father God that when I was suffering in my heart, He caused you to give me a verse from the Bible that really helped me. It was the time Abraham was ninety-nine and Jehovah appeared to him, saying, "I am the almighty God." I was comforted very much by this verse. Every sentence in God's Word is powerful. His promises are reliable. I really thank and praise Him because He is the almighty God. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>We had a good conversation with Mr. Wang Kuo Hsiang yesterday. He has obeyed the Lord and wants to walk in the same way we do. This Lord's Day he will be able to break bread to remember the Lord with us. He sang hymns and prayed with us yesterday. When he was praying, he really praised and thanked the Lord through tears! When he was singing, he constantly shed tears. We hope he can really gain the Lord and that the Lord can gain him. We hope that you do not forget to remember the assembly in Chefoo in your prayer. Brother Pi Chen has gone to Mou Pin to give some testimony of the gospel in Brother Wang Hsin Wen's home. From there he will go to Wei Hai and testify. Please pray for him much in the Lord so that the work he does in Wei Hai will be the Lord's will. The brothers and sisters in Chefoo are all in peace. Your family is also well. The wife of the third brother in the Lee family also comes to the meetings. Please do not worry. I will tell you the rest later. May you have peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chao Ching Hai<br />February 8, 1935</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
