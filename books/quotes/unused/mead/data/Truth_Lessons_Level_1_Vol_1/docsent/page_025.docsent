   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SECOND STEP OF THE FALL A. The Background</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Adam and Eve sinned, they hid themselves from the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But God came to seek them and promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Adam heard this, he immediately called his wife Eve Gen 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eve means Living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This proves that Adam believed God s promise and received God s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, Genesis 4:1 says, And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have acquired a man, Jehovah Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cain means acquired.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Eve gave birth to Cain, she declared, I have obtained it!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Eve s concept, Cain was the seed of woman promised in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Her words in Genesis 4:1 prove that she believed that promise and received the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With such a background, man should have obtained God s salvation by God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet, how pitiful it is that man fell again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Cause</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 4 shows us two kinds of examples.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abel was an example of believing the gospel and living for the gospel, while Cain was an example of turning from God s way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The latter brought about the second step of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Devil s Gain</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One reason for Cain s continuing the fall was that the Devil had gained him inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of Genesis 4, Satan had already entered into man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, in man s second fall, apparently it was Cain who rejected God s glad tidings; actually it was Satan who kept him from God s way of salvation and even caused him to fall further.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the second step of man s fall was instigated by the subtle one who had gained Cain and worked within him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man s Presumption</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>in Forsaking God s Way of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God had shown man His way of salvation to clothe him with the skins of sacrificial lambs Gen 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Cain was presumptuous in that he forsook God s way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He followed Satan and put aside God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the cause of man s further fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. The Process 1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Serving God according to Man s Own Way Inventing a Religion of Man s Concept</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect Gen 4:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both presented offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One offered according to his own opinion and the other offered according to God s concept.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abel followed the way of God s salvation to offer a sacrifice as his substitute by the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But Cain rejected God s way in his service and offering; he invented a religion of man s concept, according to his own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man s Anger</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When he learned that God did not look upon his offering, Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell Gen 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the result of serving God according to his own concept.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man s Murder of His Brother</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him Gen 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Cain began by serving God, then continued by being angry, and finally ended by killing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No wonder the Lord Jesus says, An hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering service to God John 16:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The question is not whether we serve God or we commit sin, but whether we act according to God s way or according to our own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not give any room to our concepts in all things that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man s Lie and Arrogance toward God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And he said, I know not: Am I my brother s keeper?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Gen 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Cain s answer to God was not only a lie, but it also showed how arrogant he was.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Man was somewhat afraid of God after the first step of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But here man dared to display his arrogance toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>D. The Result</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result of the second step of the fall, God pronounced a greater curse: man would till the ground, but the ground would not yield to him her strength.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, he will become a vagabond wandering on the earth, and he was cast out of the presence of God, unable to see God s face Gen 4:11-12, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Eventually Cain and his descendants invented a culture without God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This culture included building a city for self-existence, inventing cattle-raising for making a living, inventing music for amusement, and inventing weapons for defense Gen 4:17, 20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The further man drifts away from God, the less he has His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Having lost God, man was forced to invent a godless culture.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the result of the fall of man.</S>
