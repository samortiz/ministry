   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOUSEHOLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Beginning also with the Brethren, the saints began to see that the church is God's household, God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is clearly revealed in Ephesians 2:19 which says, "So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The very God is our Father and we all are His children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being His children, we are the folks of God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for household refers both to the house, the dwelling place, and to the household, the family.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can translate the same word with these two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The end of Ephesians 2 reveals the household as the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 19 mentions the household, while verse 22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The household is the dwelling place, the habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, physically speaking, the household can never be the dwelling place of a father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, spiritually speaking, all of God's children at the same time are both God's family and also God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's habitation is built with His children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, His children are both His family and His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The family is the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can declare to the whole universe that we are both God's family and God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are His children, and at the same time we are His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Brethren, in their teachings, have made this very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the assembly, the gathering of God's called ones, they went on to the family of God, the household, and to the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Brethren also saw that the church, which is the family, the household of God, is the Body of Christ Eph 1:23; 1 Cor 10:17; 12:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some Christian teachers say that the Body of Christ is merely a parable illustrating how close we are to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to this teaching, we are close to Christ just like the members of the body are close to the head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must correct this wrong teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ is not a parable but a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would be terrible to say that my body is a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My body is not an illustration; it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, the church as the Body of Christ is a fact, not a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may consider the vine tree in John 15 as a parable, but you cannot say that the church being the Body of Christ is a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is first the assembly, second the household, third the Body, and finally the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the one book of Ephesians all these points are there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ekklesia is in chapter one v. 22 , the household is in chapter two v. 19 , the Body is in chapters one, two, three, four, and five 1:23; 2:16; 3:6; 4:4, 12, 16; 5:23, 30 , and the new man is in chapters two and four 2:15; 4:24 . The new man is the highest aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who translated the Revised Standard Version of the Bible made a great mistake when they translated the new man in Ephesians 4:24 into "the new nature."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Greek text, the new man here is the same phrase that is used in 2:15 "that He might create the two in Himself into one new man."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To translate the same phrase in 4:24 as the new nature is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word for man in 4:24 is also used in 4:13, which says, "Until we all arrive...at a full-grown man."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse cannot be translated, "until we all arrive at a full-grown nature."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same chapter, chapter four of Ephesians, this word is used at least twice a full-grown man and a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the Body we must go on to see that the church is the new man.</S>
