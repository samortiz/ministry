   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Worthy One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Savior is the Lamb as well as the Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have a Lion-Lamb Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This One is worthy to open the scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apart from Him, no one in the universe is worthy to open the secret, the mystery, of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Lion-Lamb is worthy because He has accomplished redemption and has won the victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we Christians have said that Christ was worthy, our thought was that He was worthy of our praises and thanks and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we said, Lord Jesus, You are worthy, not many of us realized that He was worthy to open the seals of the secret of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We only had the concept that Christ was worthy to receive worship, praise, and thanks from us, His little creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is an inadequate concept of the Lord s worthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet most hymns on the worthiness of Christ express this inadequate concept of His worthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not many hymns praise Christ for being worthy to open the secret of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This aspect of the Lord s worthiness is universal and immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, Christ is worthy of our praises.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is even worthy of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, we must realize that, according to Revelation 5, Christ s worthiness is a matter of His being worthy to open the secret of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The universe is a mystery which the scientists cannot unravel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They simply do not know the meaning or the purpose of the universe, because it is a secret kept from them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Christ is worthy to open this secret for He is worthy to open the seals of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 5:5 says that the Lion is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A scroll is a roll of parchment paper or other material.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because a scroll is rolled up, it is difficult to determine just how long it is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The scroll in Revelation 5 is eternally long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only Christ is worthy to open this eternally-long scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not think that you have seen everything contained in this scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, we shall need eternity to see all that is included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are in the New Jerusalem, we shall still be reading the contents of the scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For eternity we shall say, Now I see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God will give us an eternal surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The surprise of the opening of the scroll will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you are in eternity, you may say, The Lord s surprise is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we are now in eternity, we still cannot see the end. Christ is worthy to open this scroll of God s mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. Worshipped by the Angels</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>and All the Other Creatures</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because Christ is so worthy, here in this heavenly scene He is worshipped by the angels and all the other creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The angels are represented by the twenty-four elders, and all the other creatures are represented by the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The angels have elders, the twenty-four angelic elders who take the lead to worship Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here in this picture we see the twenty-four elders praising and all the angels praising, the four living creatures praising and all the other creatures praising.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Together they render universal worship to God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Christ in whom we believe is such a universal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>CHRIST IN HIS ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we come to Christ in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is an administration in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The universe does not operate in a nonsensical way; it operates according to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we cannot see this Administrator, He is nonetheless carrying out His divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All earthquakes, such as the earthquake which recently hit North China, come from His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is not only the Savior, the Lion, and the Lamb; He is also the Administrator of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A. Among the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Firstly, Christ is administrating God s purpose among the churches, exercising a priestly care for the churches 1:11-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In chapter one, Christ is revealed as the Son of Man clothed in the robe of the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today, in God s administration, Christ exercises His priestly care among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Among the churches, He is clad in a priestly robe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, He is girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is interesting to note that He is not girded about the loins but about the breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This indicates that all His work has been accomplished and that now He is exercising a loving care for His beloved churches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today, Christ no longer works, but He cares for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He even rebukes and chastises us in love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the loving Priest caring for His churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>B. In the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Revelation clearly shows that, on the one hand, Christ is among the churches and that, on the other hand, He is in the heavens carrying out God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The strongest proof of this is in 5:7, which, speaking of Christ s receiving the scroll, says, And He came and took it out of the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The scroll of God s economy has been put into Christ s hands; He now holds God s economy and carries it out.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not see this revelation in any other New Testament book.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While Christ is in the heavens carrying out God s economy, which is mainly concerned with God s judgment of the earth, He takes care of God s people 7:1-3; 8:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is fully revealed in chapters seven and eight.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God has two peoples the children of Israel and the redeemed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No matter how much this earth is judged by Christ in God s administration, He will take care of the chosen Israel and of the redeemed church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hallelujah, we all are under Christ s care in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I strongly believe that today Christ is caring for the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not matter what the other nations say or do, for the nation of Israel is under the care of Christ s universal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The other countries may try certain things, but all will be in vain because of the watchful concern of the universal Administrator.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all must worship Christ as the Administrator, as the One in the heavens administering all things for the fulfillment of God s economy.</S>
