<h2 class="head2">The Woman Bearing the Symbols of Three Ages</h2>
<p>This woman is clothed with the sun, and the moon is underneath her feet. Furthermore, there is a crown of twelve stars on her head. Each of these heavenly signs is associated with a part of the woman&mdash;her body is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and the twelve stars are on her head. Each of these parts signifies a specific age. <em>Sun</em> denotes the age of grace. Luke 1:78 says that the first coming of the Lord Jesus is like the rising sun visiting us from on high. <em>Stars</em> and <em>moon</em> denote the dark night of the Old Testament age before the coming of the Lord Jesus, which can be further divided into the age of the patriarchs and the age of the law. The age of the patriarchs is signified by the twelve stars, and the age of the law is signified by the moon. The age of the patriarchs is from Adam to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob until the giving of the law; the dispensation of the law begins with Moses and concludes with the coming of the Lord Jesus. In the age of the patriarchs, people were not under the principle of the law but under the principle of grace; hence, the stars are on top of the woman&rsquo;s head. The law was not God&rsquo;s original intention; hence, the moon, representing the law, is underneath the woman&rsquo;s feet. These three symbols&mdash;the sun, the moon, and the stars&mdash;tell us that this woman is composed of all the Lord&rsquo;s people in these three ages.</p>
<p>Some Bible expositors say that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, but this understanding lacks thoughtfulness. Mary was an Israelite woman, and it would have been impossible for her to be represented by a universal woman who stands between the heavens and the earth, who is clothed with the sun, who has the moon underneath her feet, and who has a crown of twelve stars on her head. Mary is only a part of this woman. This woman is the aggregate of all those who belong to the Lord throughout the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, and the age of grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MAN-CHILD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Man-child Being the Overcomers in the Church</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:4 says, &ldquo;The dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child.&rdquo; This dragon symbolizes the ancient serpent Satan who stands before the woman with the intention to devour the man-child whom she will bring forth (v. 5), not to destroy the woman. The woman and the man-child are one entity before the child is brought forth; therefore, the man-child is a part of the woman. In the Bible females signify the weaker part, and males signify the stronger part. Although the woman symbolizes that God&rsquo;s people are weak, the man-child who is brought forth by the woman symbolizes a stronger part within the woman. This strength is seen by the fact that the man-child will shepherd all the nations with an iron rod (v. 5). In speaking of the overcomers in the church in Thyatira, verses 26 and 27 of chapter 2 say, &ldquo;He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod.&rdquo; A comparison of these verses with 12:5 proves that the man-child is composed of the overcomers in the church. Just as the man-child is a part of the woman, the overcomers are the stronger part of the church.</p>
<p>The first man created by God, Adam, failed to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, God Himself came to be the second man, the Lord Jesus, in order to accomplish His purpose. Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the church as the one new man was produced. This is the third man in the Bible. However, shortly after being produced, the church became weak and was unable to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. Hence, in Revelation the Lord called for overcomers to be the man-child in order to accomplish the work that the church has not been able to accomplish (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21; 12:5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Overcomers Caring Only for God&rsquo;s Purpose,<br />
Not for Their Own Enjoyment</h2>
<p>All the churches on the earth today are a part of the universal woman as the totality of God&rsquo;s people. However, not everyone among God&rsquo;s people is strong. Consequently, God needs to call overcomers to be the man-child to accomplish His purpose. The case of Gideon in Judges 6 and 7 is a type of God&rsquo;s call for overcomers. At that time the children of Israel were experiencing the oppression and attack of Midian; consequently, God called Gideon to lead the people into battle against Midian. Initially, more than thirty-two thousand Israelites responded to God&rsquo;s call and were willing to fight. God, however, felt that there were too many people, so He asked Gideon to proclaim, &ldquo;Whoever is afraid and trembling should return and depart from here&rdquo; (7:3). As a result, twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained. However, God still felt that there were too many, and He eventually selected only three hundred men who lapped water into their mouth with their hand (vv. 6-7). They were the overcomers, the man-child of that time. Thus, we see that the overcomers are a group of people who, by God&rsquo;s grace, do not care for their own enjoyment but for God&rsquo;s purpose and interest. This is the distinction between the overcomers and others: they care only for God&rsquo;s purpose, not for their own enjoyment, future, career, marriage, family, or security.</p>
