   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRIST WHO IS OUR PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING EVERYTHING TO US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Colossians Paul reveals that Christ is not only our life but also our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is all and in all v. 11 , and He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul says that food, drink, the feasts, the new moon, and the Sabbath are all shadows, the body of which is Christ 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The shadow is not what is real; the body of the shadow is what is real.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, as the body of all the shadows, Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a sense, the food we eat and the water we drink are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These things are merely shadows of the reality, which is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, if we do not have Christ, we are hungry and thirsty and have nothing John 4:13-14; 7:37; 6:33, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Daily we are surrounded by light, but the light we see is a shadow, pointing to the One who is the real light and reminding us that we need the real light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the real light 9:5 ; if we do not have Him, we are in darkness 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may have many articles of clothing and may dress very well, but we must realize that our clothing is not our real covering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our real covering and clothing are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to put on Christ; otherwise, we are naked in the eyes of God Rom 13:14; Gal 3:27; Rev 3:17; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have Christ, outwardly we may appear healthy and well-dressed, but in reality we are poor, hungry, naked, and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s intention in making Christ our portion is that Christ would be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since Christ is the reality of every positive thing, and since it is God s desire that Christ would be everything to us, we need to experience Christ in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, we need to experience Christ as our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I can illustrate this with an experience that some of my co-workers and I had.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One time a number of us were invited to a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we arrived at the feast, we noticed that everyone was dressed in a very fancy way except for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As servants of the Lord, we did not like to dress in a worldly way, but everyone around us was dressed in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time I had an inward feeling, and I said within myself, All of you here think that you are dressed in a fancy way, but you must realize that my clothing is much better than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My clothing is much better because I am covered with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While I am here among you, I am clothed with Christ, and I am expressing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was a practical experience of Christ as my clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO US By Experiencing Christ in an Ordinary Way</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since Christ is our portion, we must apply Him and experience Him practically in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can we experience Christ as everything to us?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nearly every Christian knows that Jesus said that He is the bread of life John 6:35, 48 , but how many Christians know how to experience Christ as the bread of life in a practical way?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may say that the way to experience Christ as the bread of life is to read and study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is very close, but we need something further.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others may say that they have experienced Christ as their bread by experiencing a particular verse in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A sister once told me that several times she had experienced Psalm 23:4, which says, Even though I walk / Through the valley of the shadow of death, / I do not fear evil, / For You are with me; / Your rod and Your staff, / They comfort me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is good, but we need to learn to experience Christ not only in an extraordinary way but also in a very ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most Christians today like to hear things that sound wonderful to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They like to hear how great the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, most do not realize that the Lord desires us to experience Him in a very practical and ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can see this desire in His statement in John 6:48, which says, I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The day before making this statement, the Lord fed five thousand people with only a few pieces of bread and some fish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After performing this miracle, the people came to Him, thinking, This One is so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us make Him king.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Faced with such a situation, the Lord seemed to say to them, I do not want to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I want to be a piece of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I want to be the bread of life for you to take.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He who eats Me shall live because of Me. The people viewed the Lord as being very great, but the Lord likened Himself to something very ordinary bread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From this we can see that the Lord s desire is that we would experience Him in a very practical and even ordinary way in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is precious that the Lord does wonderful things in our lives, but it is even more precious that we can experience Him in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Day by day we can take Christ as our food and live by Him.</S>
