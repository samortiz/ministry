<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Personal Preaching</H2><P>The first thing we will see is the work of personal preaching. The power of the soul varies according to the individual's psychological condition. Some people's minds are stronger than others; sometimes they can read other people's minds. They know that in order to deal with other people it is better to know what they are thinking. In this way they will be able to speak the right word to the right person. This natural ability to know about others is something that should be rejected. Forgive me for using myself as an example. When I contact someone, it is very easy for me to know what they are thinking about after two or three sentences. I just know, and there is no special reason why I do. When I first began to work for the Lord, I thought that a natural knowledge of what others are thinking could be helpful to my work. But later I became clearer and dared not use this natural ability. Whenever something like this occurs, I immediately pray to resist it. Every time I talk to a person, I try not to find out what he is thinking. One thing is certainâ€”everything that comes out of the soul or is done by the soul will not have any result. If you do something according to your soulish power, even though the other person may say he has received the help, he will not be perfected in life; in the deepest part of his being, he has not received any profit. When a person comes to you, the most important thing to do is to pray to God to show you how to help this person. You should say to God, "I do not know what this person is thinking about nor what his psychological condition is; neither do I know what his spiritual condition is; I just come to You without relying on anything else. Please give me the words." You have to lay yourself totally aside and receive your help only from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Revival Meetings</H2><P>Here is another example which is most interesting: many brothers involved in the work of preaching have often told me that if they go into a chapel with dim lighting, small attendance, and many empty seats, their strength seems to disappear when they stand up to speak. If the lights are bright, however, and there are many people sitting and waiting expectantly for them to speak, they have strength; the more they speak, the more powerful they become. But I would like to ask what kind of power this is. Frankly speaking, this is nothing other than the power of their soul. The power from the Holy Spirit will never be affected by any outside influences. If you want to know what preaching by the power of the soul means, just go to a big chapel, where there is a large audience with good equipment. Simply listen to the singing and watch the actions, and you will realize that there is always a special power behind a large gathering. But what kind of power is it? While you are in such a place, do you not feel a power pressing on you? What kind of power is this? Is this the power of the Holy Spirit? Most likely it is not. This is nothing but the power of the soul.</P><P>How do we know that is the power of the soul? Just look at what the crowd is doing. For example, they may be singing. The singing is directed toward a certain direction. Consequently, the power of all the souls is directed to one place. How great that power is! Honestly speaking, under such circumstances, you may not be able to help them as you originally intended. Instead, you may be affected by them. This is very dangerous. Many people have come to me and talked about the same thing. They told me how the number in the meeting and the atmosphere would help or hinder their speaking. I have always told them that the reason was that they were doing the speaking; they were speaking by their own power. This is why they were affected by the environment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Singing Hymns</H2><P>Many times, singing is helpful to God's work. But sometimes it becomes a soulish activity. Many people like to go to the Catholic cathedrals to worship God. They have good music. Some Catholic cathedrals have even spent more than a million dollars for an organ. Some people say that whenever they go to a Catholic cathedral to attend a mass, in their hearts they feel that they are liberated to God's presence when they walk in and hear the sound of the organ and the choir. These sensations are true indeed. If you go there once, you will know what I mean. But the question is: Is this real? Does this really lead you to God's presence? Will just a little stirring up and attraction really release your heart and draw you to God? Is this God's way? I must tell you that many arrangements in the Catholic Church are from the flesh; they have no truth to them at all. They simply stir up man's mood and religious sentiment through the music and choir. This feeling of closeness to God does not come from the power of God. Rather, it comes from the power of the songs and music. We sing hymns also, but our faith is not in the hymns. Only the work of the Holy Spirit brings us profit; otherwise, nothing will reach our spirit.</P><P>Have you ever been to a backward countryside? Thank the Lord, He has given me the chance to be in such places. Once I went to a village by the seashore. Most of the people there were fishermen. Several places nearby had believers, and they had meetings. In some places there were twenty to thirty people; in other places there were fifty to sixty people. Whenever they came together, their singing was out of tune and disorderly. Their singing could be off from one another by a few minutes. Some would sing fast, while others would sing slowly. After some finished their lines, they would wait a while to allow the rest to catch up. How could one meet in such a situation? He would probably run out of patience, and his power would probably also run out. A brother told me that just listening to their singing was enough to drain his message away. I told him that he felt this way because he had never checked if his power was from God or from himself. Please remember a principle: we always have to look at our environment and are always influenced by our environment. But if something is of the Holy Spirit, we will be able to take control over our environment. This is a very deep principle. Let us lay hold of this principle, and let us never exercise our soulish power, lest we be controlled by the environment.</P><P>Sometimes when the atmosphere is suppressing, God can release men through singing hymns or through praying. But if we make singing hymns our center, we run the danger of manifesting the power of the soul. Many people live foolishly for six days of the week. When Sunday comes, they go to church and listen to the singing; they are warmed up and become burning and happy. However, where does this kind of burning and happiness come from? I must say that there is a problem in it. After living foolishly and loosely for six days, they should feel their sin and should be convicted when they come to the Lord on the Lord's Day. How can they become burning and happy when they begin to sing? This power is most likely not spiritual power. I do not like to be too harsh of a critic about this kind of thing, but a great deal of singing is simply a stirring up of the power of the soul.</P>
