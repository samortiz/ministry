It is a walk of intimacy with the Lord. Some may say that they have a door widely opened to them in the mission field, but do they have the rest within? We may take the door and drop the rest. We may go somewhere and do a great work, but not have the rest within. Do we want the door or the rest? The door is in verse 12, and the rest is in verse 13. The apostle Paul was not the same as many Christians are today in their service. They just care for the door. But do we have the rest in our spirit? Would we sacrifice the door for the rest?</P><P>Paul paid the price to take care of the rest in his spirit. Even though the Lord opened the door to him, he sacrificed that door. He paid that price to keep the rest. This shows that we should take care of the inner rest all the time. If we just take care of the outward situation, environment, and circumstances, we are through with the Lord. We must learn to restrict ourselves to the inner feeling. The outward situation may be favorable to us, but we should not care for that. We should care for just one thing&#151;the inner rest.</P><P>If we do not have the rest in our spirit, how can the Lord have rest with us? Many times the Lord would allow us to have a choice. We should say, "Lord, my choice is not Your work or the doors opened by You. My choice is just You." The Lord may allow us to go through the open door, but if we do, we will lose the rest. The Lord may open the door for us to preach, but if we go through the door, we will lose the rest. This is a deep lesson for us to learn. We should not care much for the outward situation. Even if the outward circumstances are in favor of us, that still is not the green light. The green light is only the inner rest.</P><P>Rest includes the thought of relief, peace, and ease. If you have no rest, this means that you have no relief, peace, or ease. You may say that it is right for you to stay in a certain place to do a work for the Lord, but deep within you may have no relief, peace, or ease. Others may not know this, but you do. You may argue that the door has been opened by the Lord for you, but you still have an inner strain and feel bound within. Your arguing in a vindicating way is according to the consideration in your mind, not according to the registration in your spirit. We need to take care of the inner relief, peace, and ease within our spirit. This is one basic, spiritual principle in the matter of life. If we are going to grow in life, we should not care for the outward circumstances. We have to take care of the inner feeling of whether or not we have the rest deep within us.</P><P>The inner anointing has much to do with this inner feeling of rest. A sister once gave a testimony of how she had been given a certain amount of money. She went to the department store, where she saw a piece of wool on sale. The more she considered the cheap price and the money the Lord had sent her, the more she was convinced that she was right to buy that piece of wool. But at the same time, she did not have the peace. Still, after much consideration she bought it. Later she came to a meeting and gave this testimony. She said that after she bought that piece of wool, she could not pray. She felt bound in the spirit because she had lost the inner peace, rest, and ease. What she had done was not sinful. But she lost the peace until she sold that piece of wool to someone else. Then the peace came back.</P><P>Have we learned the lesson to take care of the inner peace and not the outward circumstances? Paul had a door opened to him by the Lord to preach the gospel. This was something very good, not sinful. But he did not have the rest. What we do is not a matter of argument, but a matter of the inner rest. In the heavenly court, the more you argue, the more you lose. The Lord might say to us, "My child, I know that your circumstances and reasons are good, but do you have the rest with the Lord? Do you care for the outward circumstances or the inward rest? I am not in the outward circumstances. I am in your spirit."</P><P>A wife may say that she is right in her argument with her husband. She may be right, but does she have the peace? Sometimes the brothers may complain about their wives, but do they have the rest? Would we go along with being right in our complaint, or would we go along with the rest? To follow the rest you have to pay a price. To argue may give you a certain kind of pleasure, but you lose the Lord's presence; you do not have the rest with the Lord. I am not speaking of the rest in your thinking or of the satisfaction in your emotion. I am speaking of the real ease, relief, peace, and rest in your spirit. We all have to learn this deeper lesson. I encourage you all to follow the Lord in this way. This is the way to grow in life. Never care for the outward circumstances; always care for the inner rest.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Christ as Life for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 62</div><br></body></html>
