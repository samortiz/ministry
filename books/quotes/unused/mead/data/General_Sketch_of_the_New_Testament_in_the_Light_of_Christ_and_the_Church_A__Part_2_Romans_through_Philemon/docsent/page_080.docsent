   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Divine Fellowship in the Epistles of John</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The three Epistles of John are a supplement concerning the fellowship in the divine family, a point which was not thoroughly covered in the definition of the Body of Christ given in the first thirteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John's three Epistles show us how God's children fellowship with the Father and with one another in the Father's family.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word fellowship is the most important word in these three books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 John 1 the eternal life is preached and ministered to us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we receive the eternal life, the issue is fellowship with one another and with the Father and His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dealing with Apostasy in Jude</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The short book of Jude is a supplement to deal with apostasy, which was not dealt with in the first thirteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Five matters Judaism, works and faith, the government of God, the divine fellowship, and apostasy are all dealt with in these last eight Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In total, there are twenty-one Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thirteen of these define the Body of the universal man, and the remaining eight are a supplement to make us clear about the above five matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without these eight books, we still have a full definition of the church, the nature of the church, the fellowship of the church, the responsibility of the church, and the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we are not clear about the position of Judaism and the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither do we know the relationship between faith and works, God's government in the universe, the divine fellowship in God's family, and apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because this supplement of eight books is added to the Epistles, every matter is covered, and there are no unanswered questions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation as the Consummation of the Entire Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following these eight books, there is Revelation as the ultimate consummation and conclusion of the New Testament and the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This long book of twenty-two chapters speaks clearly about three main points.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first main point is found in the first three chapters, which present the vision of the local churches existing on the earth to be the golden lampstands as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the accomplishment of God's eternal intention and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The third main point is found in the last two chapters, chapters twenty-one and twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we have a picture of the work of God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, which consummates in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In nature, in principle, and in nearly every aspect, this building is exactly the same as the golden lampstands in chapters one through three.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The local churches are the local lampstands, and this building is a universal lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entire city of New Jerusalem is a great golden lampstand; Christ, the Lamb, is the lamp on this stand; and God in Christ is the light 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the great, universal, unique, and ultimate lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whereas all the local churches are the golden lampstands in time, the great, universal, unique lampstand is in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In eternity there will be one unique lampstand in the entire universe, but in time on this earth today in each locality of human society, there is a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The local lampstands are the same in nature, in life, in function, and in almost every aspect as the unique, great, universal lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the two ends of Revelation there are the first and third main points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then from chapters four to twenty there is a long section containing God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the second main point.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God judges all things which do not correspond with the unique lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord accomplished redemption, He ascended to the heavens; it is at this time that God's judgment began.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 4 through 20 is a long record starting from the time of the Lord's ascension until the time of His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This period of time is a dispensation of not only the gospel but of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, throughout the past two thousand years God has been propagating the gospel to the fallen race, but on the other hand, He has constantly been judging.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One of the first items of God's judgment was the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God sent the army of Titus, the prince of the Roman Empire, to destroy that Jewish city, because the system of Judaism, although it was religious and good, did not correspond with the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With this viewpoint, we can understand the history both of the church and of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Century after century, God has judged those things that do not correspond to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Roman Empire, the Spanish Empire, and even the British Empire were judged by God because they did not correspond with the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we should be warned and reminded that everything we have must correspond to the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today God is using even the communist governments to judge certain things, but I have the full assurance that one day God will turn around and judge communism.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is similar to what He did in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God used Assyria and Babylon to judge other nations, including Israel, but afterward He turned around and judged these empires.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the book of Revelation, God is seeking after only one thing the Body of Christ, the church, the lampstand as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Anything that does not correspond to this, God will judge and burn with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, everything that does not correspond to the church will be burned in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, all things which correspond to the testimony of the church will be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are only two issues for all things: the lake of fire and the New Jerusalem.</S>
