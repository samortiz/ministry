   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 12:2 says, "But be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must all remember that our responsibility is to obey God's will, while God is responsible for the result of our obedience to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not have the responsibility of finding a smooth pathway for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As far as smoothness is concerned, we can say that the Son of God lived the roughest life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was responsible for obeying God's will, while God was responsible for His "misfortunes."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we say that cleverness is useless to a Christian, we do not mean that we should go and do foolish things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our cleverness is useless in God's hand, and our foolishness is also useless in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has no need of our foolishness just as He has no need of our cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not saying that foolish things are good; we are saying that whatever is according to God's will is good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to differentiate between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Purposely saying foolish things or purposely making a blunder does not make a person better.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to be responsible for obeying God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God wants us to do something, we should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The result and effect of that action is God's business, not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to ask God to save us from our "head," so that our "head" has salvation and we have on the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we encounter anything, the first thing we should do is confess to God: "Lord, my head and my cleverness are not the principles by which I live my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a Christian, everything I do is for the purpose of fulfilling Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This does not mean that we have to act foolishly or become a fool.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will repeat again that God does not need a foolish man, just as He does not need a clever man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not live in this world according to what our mind thinks; rather, we should prove what is God's good and well pleasing and perfect will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some people have a commercial mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever they encounter something, the first thing that comes into their mind is a calculation of gains and losses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do this in ordinary matters, and they do this also in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of mentality needs to receive a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In spiritual matters, the main thing is not whether one comes out on top; it is not a question of personal gain or loss, but a question of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn that in this world we live by only one principle: trusting in God's grace and doing His will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 4:23 says, "And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that man's mind needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 12 speaks of the same thing: "Be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The result is "that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our mind is renewed, we will prove what God's will is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether or not a man understands God's will has nothing to do with methods; it has to do with the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people know methods for finding out God's will, but they themselves are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, they still are unable to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who will know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only those who have been delivered by God from their mental strength know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our mind must be renewed before we can prove what God's will is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to remember that the strongest part of man's natural life is his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With some, the strength of their natural life lies in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With others, the strength of their natural life lies in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But with most, the strength of their natural life lies in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as you meet a person who is strong in his mind, you touch his "head."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he comes to you, his thoughts come as well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His thoughts are stronger than his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He seems very clever, and his outstanding feature is his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But unless the Lord breaks this strength and smashes this power, such a person cannot know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to ask God to deliver us from trusting in our mind or our mental ability.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people constantly confess that their flesh is wrong and that their natural life is not proper, yet they still treasure their thoughts, their views, and their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They say with their mouth that they do not trust in these things, but their heart is still full of their own ideas and cleverness, and they still think that their views and ways are better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their cleverness has not yet been broken, and their thoughts have not yet been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, they cannot know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people are full of God's will in their mouth, yet in reality, they know nothing about God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We know that a wrong person will never know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God needs to do a fundamental work in us through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In particular, He has to renew our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has to break our old man so that we will no longer appreciate our own cleverness and no longer think that we are better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once our "head" is dealt with, we will prove God's will, and we will know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our problem is that human thoughts often have replaced God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, our "head" needs to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No one who is ignorant of the cross will know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, the whole question comes back to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you know that the cross is here to deal with your natural life?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you know how God deals with you as a person?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One day God will grant you grace and lead you to the point where you realize that your self as well as your thoughts are not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then you will no longer believe in yourself or treasure your natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then many things will become clear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whenever your natural life is dealt with by God, you will be clear concerning His will.</S>
