   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ Calling the Defeated Believers to Be His Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His seven epistles to the degraded churches, Christ calls the defeated believers to be His overcomers by Himself as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for their experience of His organic salvation in His sevenfold intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>C. To Consummate the New Jerusalem 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Unique Goal of the Christian Work</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, the unique goal of the Christian work should be the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate goal of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Main Cause of the Church's Degradation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The degradation of the church is mainly due to the fact that nearly all the Christian workers are distracted to take many things other than the New Jerusalem as their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Overcoming Everything Which Replaces the New Jerusalem as Our Goal</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, under the degradation of the church, to be an overcomer answering the Lord's call needs us to overcome not only the negative things but even more the positive things which replace the New Jerusalem as the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An Overcomer's Goal</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An overcomer's goal should be uniquely and ultimately the goal of God's eternal economy, that is, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I want to encourage us once again to get the points of these outlines into us by following the pattern of the saints in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They pray-read the outlines, study them, recite the points of the outlines, and then they speak these points to one another, that is, they prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The churches in Taiwan have been revived by taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we take this way, I believe that the churches in Southern California will have a big revival.</S>
