<h2 class="head1">V. THE OFFICERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION<br />
OF DAVID&rsquo;S GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>First Chronicles 27 speaks of the officers in the administration of David&rsquo;s government.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Officers Who Served the King<br />
Being of Twelve Divisions</h2>
<p>The officers who served the king were of twelve divisions, twenty-four thousand in each division, taking care of the king&rsquo;s affairs month by month throughout all the months of the year (vv. 1-15). This was excessive, and it might have been a hidden factor in the rebellion after the time of Solomon. Any enjoyment that is too luxurious cannot last. Today no one should have an enjoyment that is excessive and too luxurious.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Thirteen Captains Ruling<br />
over the Twelve Tribes and the House of Aaron</h2>
<p>Thirteen captains ruled over the twelve tribes and the house of Aaron (vv. 16-22). Here we should note that David did not take the number of the children of Israel from twenty years old and under because of the fear of the wrath of God (vv. 23-24). David&rsquo;s numbering of the people had offended God (2 Sam. 24), and thus he did not dare to count the younger ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. There Being Officers over the King&rsquo;s Treasures</h2>
<p>There were officers over the king&rsquo;s treasures and overseers of the property that belonged to the king (1 Chron. 27:25-31).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. David Having Counselors,<br />
Teachers, Friends, and the Captain of His Army</h2>
<p>David had counselors, teachers, friends, and the captain of his army (vv. 32-34).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Typifying the Submission to the Authority<br />
and Headship of Christ in the Church</h2>
<p>The governmental order in David&rsquo;s administration typifies the submission to the authority and headship of Christ in the church in the New Testament (1 Cor. 11:3; Eph. 4:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. DAVID&rsquo;S ASSEMBLING AT JERUSALEM<br />
ALL THE LEADERS OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>First Chronicles 28 and 29 are a record of David&rsquo;s assembling at Jerusalem all the leaders of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. His Address to the Assembly</h2>
<p>In 28:2-8 we have David&rsquo;s address to the assembly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Introducing His Son Solomon<br />
to Be the Builder of the Temple of God</h2>
<p>David introduced his son Solomon to be the builder of the temple of God (vv. 2-7). David said that he had it in his heart to build a house for Jehovah. However, Jehovah told him that he would not build a house for His name but that Solomon his son would build His house (vv. 2-3, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Charging Them to Observe<br />
All the Commandments of Jehovah</h2>
<p>David charged the leaders to observe all the commandments of Jehovah in order that they might possess the good land and leave it as an inheritance forever to their children (v. 8). If they behaved properly before God, they would enjoy the land and leave the land as an inheritance to their children.</p>
