<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: You have mentioned how we should begin the meeting, but how should we end the meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In principle, we should end the meeting in the same way that we begin the meeting&mdash;according to the leading of the Spirit. We should end the meeting when the saints all have the sense that it is time to end the meeting.</p>
<p><em>Question: It seems that the only way for a group of believers to meet in this way is if they are one. Is this correct?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is absolutely correct; we must have the genuine oneness. This oneness is not a oneness in doctrine; it is a oneness in loving and experiencing the Lord. You love the Lord, and I love the Lord; you experience the Lord, and I experience the Lord. You may believe in baptism by sprinkling, and I may believe in baptism by immersion, but that should not bother us, because our oneness is not a oneness in doctrine but in loving and experiencing the Lord. We should not endeavor to have oneness in doctrine. Such a oneness is not genuine oneness. If we try to have oneness in doctrine, we will create division. As long as a person believes that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, that He was incarnated to be a man, died on the cross, was resurrected on the third day, and is now in the heavens as our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord, that is good enough. Such a believer is our brother. It does not matter whether he believes in immersion or sprinkling or what he believes related to head covering or foot-washing. These kinds of doctrinal matters should not bother us and should not be allowed to damage our oneness.</p>
<p>If some come among us and seek to promote a particular practice or doctrine, we should not exclude them. For example, in the past some have tried to promote the things of the Pentecostal movement. We did not exclude these ones; we welcomed them. We told them, &ldquo;Dear brothers and sisters, we welcome you, and we respect you, but we beg you not to promote the things of the Pentecostal movement. If you do this, you will scare some of the other brothers and sisters away. This is not the place for you to promote or to push these things. This is a place for all the believers to come together in a general way.&rdquo; Most of the ones with whom we fellowshipped in this way saw this matter and remained with us. Others who were more subjective, however, stopped coming because they could not dance or play the tambourine as they wished. When they played the tambourine, we begged them not to, saying, &ldquo;Dear brother, please do not play the tambourine here. You can play at home, but if you play here, you will scare some of the others away. We love you and respect you, but we are not in the Pentecostal church. We are here simply to come together in a general way.&rdquo; Praise the Lord that there were many who received this kind of fellowship. Some even agreed not to speak in tongues in the meetings for the sake of others.</p>
<p>We must not take any special standing. Our standing is the general standing of the church. We are simply Christians who have been saved and regenerated by the Lord and who are coming together to practice the church life in a general way. All the Lord&rsquo;s children are our brothers and sisters, and we are open to them. We do not have anything special here. Everything is general. This way truly works.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do you carry out &ldquo;Sunday School&rdquo; for the children?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In principle, there should be some teaching and some ministry in the meetings for the children and for the young people on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Strictly speaking, this kind of meeting is not a meeting of the church; it is a meeting of the work. This kind of meeting is part of the church&rsquo;s ministry, the church&rsquo;s work. When the brothers and sisters come together to pray in a mutual way, this is a church meeting. When the saints come together to have the Lord&rsquo;s table in a mutual way, this is a church meeting. When you come together to share your testimonies or to study the Word in a mutual way, this is also a church meeting. However, if you have a meeting for the children or young people, you need to have some teaching, some ministry. This is not a meeting of the church but a part of the work of the church. Similarly, when we have a meeting in which a servant of the Lord gives a message, this is not a church meeting but a meeting for the ministry, the work.</p>
<p><em>Question: If we were to have a meeting for young people on a certain evening during the week, would that also be considered a ministry meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If this meeting consists solely of a group of young believers coming together to fellowship with one another, this would be in the principle of a church meeting. Church meetings are meetings of mutuality. Meetings that are for the purpose of teaching or ministering the Word are meetings of the work, but meetings that are conducted according to the principle of mutuality are meetings of the church. It may not be possible to always have meetings for the work, but we should always have meetings in which the saints come together to pray, study, testify, and admonish in mutuality (Heb. 10:24-25). In these meetings it is not necessary to have particular ones take the lead or bear the responsibility. We must realize that in the meetings of the church, everyone has the responsibility to share something in a mutual and spontaneous way.</p>
<p><em>Question: What happens when there are visitors among us? Does this change the nature of the meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If we have the Lord&rsquo;s grace, when a believer comes to our meetings for the first time, even he will be able to share something and to mingle with us. Actually, there are no &ldquo;visitors.&rdquo; We are all members of the family of God. I am a child of God, and so are you. Thus, when a believer comes to one of our meetings for the first time, we should not view him as a visitor but as a member of the family who has come home. This is the real church life.</p>
<p>If we will give up all the hindrances, bonds, and frustrating elements, the Holy Spirit will have a free way to move. When the Holy Spirit has the free way to move, many things will begin to happen. Our numbers will begin to increase. Many new believers will be brought into the church. Another thing that will happen is that the saints will genuinely grow in their spiritual life, and their spiritual gifts will begin to be manifested. In addition, the saints will begin to love one another more. The experience of the divine life will result in an increase in love, because love is the issue of life (1 John 3:14). This will cause the church life to be living, prevailing, functioning, and powerful. This is what God&rsquo;s people are longing for. Deep in their spirits they are longing for this. They cannot utter or explain what they desire, but they have such a longing. If the believers in a particular city would practice this and be faithful in this matter, many believers would be attracted.</p>
<p><em>Question: I am worried that when those who have never heard this kind of fellowship come among us, they will not understand what we are doing. Is this not a concern?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to worry that others will not understand. If we are faithful before the Lord to practice to have proper Christian meetings in a way that is truly spiritual and full of life, when others come among us, they will appreciate what we are doing and realize that it is of the Lord. Surely the Holy Spirit will move in them to vindicate, prove, and confirm this way.</p>
<p>Every day we have three meals a day&mdash;breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This is not a form; it is a human need. If you eat only one meal a day, this will be detrimental to your health. To maintain the health of our physical body, we need to eat at least three times a day. Similarly, to maintain our spiritual health and to have a proper church life, we need to meet together several times in a given week. It is not healthy to meet only once a week. Every week we need to meet together to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship together and admonish one another. It is fine to mingle the study of the Word with the prayer or with the fellowship, but in principle we need to have times together every week to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship. In addition, according to the pattern of the New Testament, we also need to meet to have the Lord&rsquo;s table. First Corinthians 11:25 says, &ldquo;Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; The word <em>often</em> in the phrase <em>as often as you drink it</em> indicates that we need to have the Lord&rsquo;s table as often as possible. In the book of Acts the saints had the Lord&rsquo;s table every day (2:46). Later the believers had the Lord&rsquo;s table on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the first day of the week (20:7; Rev. 1:10). In addition to these four kinds of meetings&mdash;meetings for prayer, for the study of the Word, for fellowship, and for the Lord&rsquo;s table&mdash;the Lord may also raise up someone among us who has the gift of teaching. If this is the case, we can gather together periodically and allow this gifted one to minister the Word to us. This would be a special time for the ministry of the Word. This will be a help to us, but this is only something special. Ordinarily, the saints need to meet together three to four times a week for prayer, the study of the Word, fellowship, and the Lord&rsquo;s table. However, this should not be considered a regulation but a principle to meet our spiritual need.</p>
