<p>The life of Christ contains the element of His death; therefore, this life has the effectiveness of His death, which is a killing power. This killing power operates in us through His life to kill everything in us that is not of Christ, that is, everything that is not spiritual or heavenly. To put to death (v. 13; Col. 3:5) is the application of this killing power in us. We put to death the practices of the body and our sinning members on the earth not by our own strength but by living in the Lord&rsquo;s life. When we allow His life to operate as the killing power in us, our obedience issues in His applying the effectiveness of His death to us. This is the Lord working to put us to death. While the work of putting to death seemingly is done by us, it is actually an operation of the Lord as life in us. In truth, our obedience to the Lord is our acceptance of His death, and when His death is applied, we are put to death.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus.&rdquo; This means that the death of the Lord Jesus is a putting to death, a killing, and that it will always do the work of putting to death, the work of killing. This killing is the issue of the element of death contained in the Lord&rsquo;s life. Hence, this killing is an effect of the Lord&rsquo;s death according to the power of His life. Because the Lord has passed through death and resurrection, His life contains the elements of death and resurrection. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the power of resurrection and also a killing power; it gives life to man and also kills the negative things in man.</p>
<p>Many saints think that the Lord&rsquo;s life contains only the element of resurrection. According to the revelation of the Bible and according to our experience, however, the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the elements of His death and His resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s life has the element of His resurrection and the element of His death. Unless we see this, we will think that the Lord&rsquo;s life has the power only to enliven but does not have the power to kill the things in us that do not match Him. If we see that the Lord&rsquo;s life has passed through death and resurrection and that it possesses both the element of death and the element of resurrection, we will recognize that the Lord&rsquo;s life not only gives us life but also kills the negative things in us. His life enlivens our spirit, soul, and body&mdash;our whole being&mdash;and fills us with God&rsquo;s life. This life also puts to death the elements of the old creation, our flesh, and everything that is incompatible with Christ.</p>
<p>The blood in our body has the strength to supply nutrients and the power to kill germs. When blood circulates in our body, it supplies nutrients to meet the needs of our body and also kills the germs in our body. This is an example of the moving of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us. The element of resurrection in the Lord&rsquo;s life supplies us to meet our needs, and the element of death in the Lord&rsquo;s life kills the things that should not be in us. Hence, the killing effect of the Lord&rsquo;s death in us cannot be separated from the supply of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us. We experience the Lord&rsquo;s death through the supply of the Lord&rsquo;s life. When we allow the Lord&rsquo;s life to move in us, supply us, and live in us, His life spontaneously does a killing work in us so that we experience His death. Our having died with Christ in Romans 6:8 becomes our practical experience through the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2. The Spirit of life applies the killing of the Lord&rsquo;s death to us so that there is a putting to death in our body. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross can be applied to us only through His life in us. We experience the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross through experiencing His life in us.</p>
<p>When I first received light concerning the experience of the Lord&rsquo;s death being through His life, I did not have the boldness to speak about it, because I had never heard anyone say this. Later this revelation became clearer to me, and I received confirmation from the co-workers. I also read a book entitled <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> by Andrew Murray, which says, &ldquo;The life of Christ in us brings with it the death, the unceasing making dead of sin&rdquo; (Day 19, note 2). I was very happy when I read this. The life of Christ contains the element of death, and by this life a power continually kills and puts to death. As long as we are willing to let this power operate in us, it will work to continually kill, put to death, and eliminate anything in us that is contrary to Christ, that is, anything improper and inappropriate.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
