   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-7; 4:8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This message is the first in a series of several on the First Epistle of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PLACE OF JOHN'S WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The writings of John have a unique position in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He wrote one Gospel, three Epistles, and the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament writings as a whole can be similarly categorized: the Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is noteworthy that each of these three sections concludes with one of John's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The final word, even in conversation, is generally the decisive word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, in the writings of John we have the final word of the whole revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GOD'S MEANS AND GOD'S GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of John deals with the matter of life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life is wonderful and profound, but it is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the way to reach the goal, God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first two chapters of the Bible deal with creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The last two chapters picture for us the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This city is a building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By considering the beginning and the ending, we can see that the goal of God's creation is a building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In creation God called things not being as being that He might have the materials for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In between the beginning and the ending the theme is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You recall that on the final day of creation God created man Gen 1:27, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God was pleased with everything He had made, and He blessed man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 2:8 we are told that God planted a garden in which He put the man whom He had formed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This garden was part of God's creation; as yet, no city had been built.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the midst of this garden, among many other trees, there was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What the fruit of this tree looked like we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can identify a peach from a peach tree, but to know what life is is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nonetheless, we know that we have life; describing it may be difficult, but in our experience we know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us rejoice that there is the tree of life, even though we cannot precisely define what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even our human life is too mysterious to be defined.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A table has no life, but a man does.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How to explain this mysterious element we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life referred to in the tree of life is far more mysterious than human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As most of us know, in Greek there are three different terms for life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The physical life is called bios.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition we have a psuche, a psychological life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The third kind of life is called zoe, the life of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word for life used here is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the next verse He said, "The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Life here is psuche.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus laid down His psuche life to accomplish redemption for us and thus to make the eternal zoe life available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing can destroy the zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus as a human being died on the cross, laying down His human psychological life in our stead, in order to impart to us the zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life, denoted by zoe, is the divine life; in actuality it is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not simply matter, but the very divine Person, the eternal Being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us" 1 John 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This very life was looked upon and handled by the apostles v. 1 . From the context it is clear that the life is Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the first verse the life is called the Word of life and in verse 2 "the life" and "that eternal life."</S>
