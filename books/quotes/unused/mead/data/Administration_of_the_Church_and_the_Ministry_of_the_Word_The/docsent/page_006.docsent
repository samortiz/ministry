   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S BUILDING BEING ACCOMPLISHED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHEN OUR PERSON IS DEALT WITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God wants to take the way of building, but the problem He encounters is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who administrate the church and minister the word are full of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our way and our doctrine are not the problem; rather, our poor condition is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have come to a critical juncture in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church in Taipei has been here for eight years, from 1949 to 1957.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we continue as we are, our work will have no result.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will only have endless problems and continual loss; there will be no increase in blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as the serving ones continue according to the traditional way, our work will have no future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the sake of God s building and the future of the work, may the Lord have mercy on us so that we would see that the problem is not with our doctrine or practice but with our person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to consider the condition of our work and our present situation before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not mean that we should be introspective.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to receive light and be helped by this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to be calm before the Lord and allow Him to shine on us, speak to us, touch us, and deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unless we have passed through the Lord s dealing hand, much of our outward activity is vain and meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God does not deal with us thoroughly, His building will not be accomplished, regardless of the methods we use.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For God s building to be accomplished in a proper way, He needs to deal with us strongly in the matters of the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the administration of the church the brothers who serve as elders need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who speak for God also need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, our administration of the church and our speaking will not result in the reality of building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May we all have a heart that fears the Lord to see that the building up of the church depends on the person of those who administrate the church and those who minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we allow God to deal with us, our work will have impact even if our method is inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, our work will tear down the building regardless of the method we use.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today God is concerned with the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The building depends on the condition of our person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May we all be calm before the Lord and allow Him to shine on us and speak to us.</S>
