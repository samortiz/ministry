[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE GLORIOUS VISION AND THE WAY OF THE CROSS 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 7:2-3; Isa 6:1-5; John 12:38, 41; 2 Pet 1:3, 16-18; Acts 9:3-6; 26:19; Rev 4:1-3; 21:10 SERVING THE LORD BEING A GREAT THING
[4]  This message is on serving the Lord and being a testimony for the Lord.
[5]  It is not the church which is calling you, nor is it the work of the gospel team which is calling you, it is the Lord Himself who has called you.
[6]  Abraham was the first called one in the Bible.
[7]  For example, in the case of Abel the book of Genesis only tells us that after he was born he experienced God under his parents' guidance.
[8]  He calls us by drawing us to Himself through opening Himself up to us.
[9]  I hope that some among you will see God Himself in a similar way and will be captured by such a glorious vision.
[10]  This morning, I hope that every one who is going to participate in the gospel outreach is a man of vision.
[11]  It must not be that some others are persuading you to join the gospel outreach.
[12]  It has to be something that touches you within, which is the God of glory unveiling Himself to you and enlightening you, who will give you unspeakable strength for you to go on in serving the Lord step by step.
[13]  He saw the God of glory sitting on the throne, and he said, "Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" 6:5 .
[14]  CHAPTER TWO THE GLORIOUS VISION AND THE WAY OF THE CROSS 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:57-62; Phil 3:10; Rev 1:9; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim 4:7-8; 1 Cor 9:27; Heb 12:1-3
[15]  In the previous chapter we covered the glorious vision.
[16]  The wonderful thing about us who believe in the Lord is that after we have received the Lord as our life, there are now two persons in our being.
[17]  Today, you young ones have put yourselves into the Lord's hands for the preaching of the gospel in the villages.
[18]  In serving the Lord, not only are we unable to do anything apart from the Lord, but neither can we do anything apart from the members.
[19]  For example, there may be two jobs in the Lord's work that need to be taken care of.
[20]  If we are on the cross, you may be telling me what to do, and I may be listening to what you say, but neither of us has the feeling that we are bearing the cross.
[21]  Everything is I. What is it to take the way of the cross? It means number one is not I. Number two and number three are not I. Even the last number is not I. Nothing is I. This is to die.
[22]  CHAPTER THREE THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; Gal 2:20; Matt 5:44; Luke 23:34 OUTLINE To be like God through divinity.
[23]  THE STAGES OF THE LITERATURE WORK IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY
[24]  During the past sixty years, I have been observing the Christian humanity.
[25]  The humanity I am talking about today is not that of an ordinary person but that of a servant of the Lord.
[26]  It is the humanity of those who are very seeking among us, who have forsaken the world and who love the Lord dearly.
[27]  But the Lord answered him, "Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" v. 3 . It seems as if the Lord was telling Nicodemus that after man was created, he had only the image of God.
[28]  Hence, Nicodemus needed to be born anew, that is, he needed to be born of water and the Spirit before he could enter into the kingdom of God v. 5b . However, Nicodemus still did not understand, and the Lord had to say to him again, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life" vv.
[29]  THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD BEING HUMAN THROUGH THE PROPER HUMAN NATURE
[30]  To be human is to take the proper way of a man.
[31]  If we go to the villages for the gospel outreach, and we give others the impression that we are like angels, I am afraid no one would dare to come close to us.
[32]  Philippians 3:9 says, "And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law."
[33]  This is like what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12, that he was then only a man in Christ v. 2 . But in Philippians 3 he said that he would like to be found in Christ v. 9 . When we were saved, we had the Lord's mercy and grace to consecrate ourselves fully to the Lord and to love Him in a pure way.
[34]  THE BETTER BRANCH GRAFTED TO THE POOR TREE PRODUCING TWO KINDS OF FRUITS
[35]  We can describe the relationship between the Lord and us by grafting.
[36]  Therefore, if we want to have the proper humanity, we have to allow the better Branch, Christ, to be grafted to us, the poor tree, so that we can grow up and produce good fruits through the joint of grafting.
[37]  GOD REGULATING MAN THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY AND THE INWARD CONSCIENCE
[38]  We have to know that the old creation and the natural life within us can do many things.
[39]  He said, "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing" vv.
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE THE POWER OF RESURRECTION AND THE CONFORMATION TO THE CROSS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19; 2:12-16; 3:9-10; 4:8, 12-13
[41]  In this message we will look specifically at the power of resurrection and the conformation to the cross.
[42]  We all know that Philippians is a book that speaks specifically about the experience of Christ.
[43]  SUBMITTING TO GOD TO TAKE THE NARROW WAY OF THE CROSS
[44]  Since the Lord died on the cross, we also should take the narrow way of the cross.
[45]  Today when I come to your dormitory, and I do not see ashes, it means that you are not yet "martyred," that you have not been "slaughtered," and that you have not been burnt to ashes.
[46]  WITHOUT MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS, HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE
[47]  In Philippians 2:14 Paul said, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings."
[48]  LIVING AN UPLIFTED HUMANITY IN THE ONE WHO EMPOWERS ME
[49]  By the end of Philippians, Paul was full of wisdom and mentioned six virtues: "Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of" 4:8 .
[50]  Hence, Paul went on to say, "In everything and in all things I have learned the secret I can do all things in Him who empowers me" vv.
[51]  We live out salvation by the God who operates within, and we live out the likeness of His death, that is, we magnify Christ, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit.
[52]  Not only should you learn these truths, you have to get into the light revealed in these truths, so that from your youth, you would build up a proper humanity and would even be able to possess the highest humanity.
