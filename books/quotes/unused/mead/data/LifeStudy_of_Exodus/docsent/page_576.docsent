   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MOSES STAY WITH GOD 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we saw that in 34:18-35 there are three important matters: feasting and resting with the Lord, five conditions for enjoying the Lord as our feast, and God s infusion into Moses by His speaking with him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we considered the matter of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall go on to consider the five conditions that must be fulfilled in order for us to feast with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO REDEEM THE FIRSTLING OF A DONKEY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WITH A LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first of the five conditions is described in verse 20: And the firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This signifies that our natural man must be replaced with Christ so that we may live a sanctified life for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though we have been redeemed, we still are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are a donkey, an unclean animal; we are not a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, we have been redeemed, but we are not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, as donkeys we need our natural being to be replaced with Christ as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As far as sanctification is concerned, we are not sheep or oxen; we are donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though we have been redeemed, our natural man is still unclean in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, in order to be sanctified to the Lord, we need Christ to be our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Passover lamb typifies Christ as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through Him as our Substitute, we have been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, because we are still unclean and natural, we cannot be a living sacrifice for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need Christ to be our Substitute in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For more regarding the firstling of a donkey being redeemed with a lamb, see Life-study of Exodus, Message 27, pages 305-307.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter how nice we may be, or how good, we still are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, I like to meet nice people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, I realize that the nicer a person is, the more natural he is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am not implying, of course, that in order to be spiritual we should be crude instead of nice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The point here is that even our natural niceness needs to be replaced with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to remember that in our natural life we are a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have been redeemed, but we are still donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So many donkeys have been gathered together in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now there is the need for all of us to be replaced with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If our natural donkey life is not replaced with Christ, we shall be hindered in the enjoyment of the feasts and also in the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Having our natural life replaced with Christ is a condition both of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>NOT OFFERING THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>OF THE LORD S SACRIFICE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WITH LEAVENED BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second condition is found in 34:25a: You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that we should not mix Christ s redemption with our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should never mix Christ s redemption with a sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not declare that we are redeemed and then continue living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To do this is to offer the blood of the Lord s sacrifice with leavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A person who is still living in sin should not boast that he has been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have pointed out that we need to keep the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is to purge away everything sinful as evidence that we have been redeemed by the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a believer clears up his sinful life, this is a testimony that he has been redeemed by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not hard for us to realize that if we still live in sin, yet claim that we have been redeemed, we shall not be able to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all have been redeemed by the blood of Christ in order to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, we still must fulfill the condition of clearing away all leaven, the requirement of not mixing Christ s redemption with a sinful life.</S>
