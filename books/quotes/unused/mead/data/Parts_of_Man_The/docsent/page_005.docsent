   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the Holy Spirit is in our spirit, then where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only is He in the Holy Spirit, but He is the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 15:45 states, "The last Adam which is Christ was made a quickening spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word "quickening" means life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ was made a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Could this life-giving Spirit be any other than the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Corinthians 3:6 says, "The Spirit giveth life."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who is this Spirit that gives life?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The answer is in verse 17 of the same chapter: "Now the Lord is that Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So Christ, the Lord, is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is indeed wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and these two spirits are joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can we contact Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The only way for us to contact Christ is to exercise our spirit, because Christ is now the Spirit, and this Spirit is the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we exercise our spirit, we can contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE DISCERNMENT OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FROM THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, dwells in our spirit, we need to discern our spirit from our soul that we may contact and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may know that man is composed of the spirit, soul, and body, but to discern the difference between the spirit and the soul is a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To know the difference between the body and the soul is easy, but to discern the spirit from the soul is rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The following illustration is most helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose we find something that we would like to purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we consider it, the more we feel that we would like to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, we make the decision to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The emotion is exercised, since we like it; the mind is exercised, because we have considered it; and the will is exercised, because we have made the decision to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the whole soul is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when we proceed to buy it, something very deep within us protests.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our emotion likes it, our mind considers it, and our will chooses it; but something deeper than all these protests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spirit is the deepest part within us, the very inmost part of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is absolutely different from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our body we have the physical life as mentioned in Luke 8:14.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our soul we have the psychological life, that is our human life, as mentioned in Matthew 16:25.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our spirit we have the spiritual life, that is the divine life, the eternal life, as mentioned in John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The unbelievers have only physical life in their body and human life in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not have the eternal life of God in their spirit, because they have not received Christ as life into their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, they can only live by the body and by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes they act according to their flesh, and sometimes they do things by desiring, by reasoning, and by choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means they are living by their body and by their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are not able to live by their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But those of us who have received Christ into our spirit can live by our spirit with Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can say that I have been crucified, and it is no more I, but Christ that lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Greek word for "I" is "ego," which is the soul, the self.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our soul, the self, has been crucified and put to death, and there is no more "I," but Christ that lives in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, we can and must live in our spirit, since Christ is living in it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must first realize that Christ is the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we need to discern the difference between the spirit and the soul that we may deny the soul and live by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we live by the spirit, Christ will have the first place in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we will experience Christ in the spirit, and we will learn how to apply Him in our daily life.</S>
