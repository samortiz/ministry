   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE PRACTICING THE GENUINE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY LIVING AND WALKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:1-2, 4-6, 11, 13, 16-25</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians is a book on Christ versus many negative matters, such as the law with all the ordinances, religion with traditions, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as we hold to one of these negative things, we are through with Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we try to keep the law with its ordinances, we are deprived of all profit from Christ 5:2 , and if we still hold on to the traditions of religion, we are brought to nought and separated from Christ v. 4 . Moreover, if we live by the flesh, we are not living by Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the negative side, Galatians exposes religion, traditions, the law, ordinances, and the flesh, and on the positive side, it shows us Christ for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each of the first four chapters of Galatians reveals a particular aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter 1, Christ is revealed in us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>15a, 16a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter 2, Christ lives in us v. 20 . In chapter 3, we have been baptized into Christ and have put Him on v. 27 . At this point, Christ is in us, and we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in chapter 4, this Christ needs to be formed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 19 says, My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ not only is revealed in us, is living in us, and is put upon us, but He is also being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that He is mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our entire being with all its inward parts our spirit, mind, will, and emotion becomes the dwelling place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may illustrate our need for Christ to be formed in us with a hand and a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If only the tips of the fingers are in the glove, we still can say that the hand is in the glove, but this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, we may declare that Christ lives in us, but He may not thoroughly dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, Paul travailed in birth that Christ would be formed in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To travail is to labor much with suffering and struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After much travailing, Christ will be formed in us in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will be truly one with Him, and He will be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ will make His home in every aspect, area, and avenue of our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is altogether a matter of Christ being revealed in us, living in us, being put upon us, and being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The experience of Christ in Galatians is not a matter of doing good or of keeping the law with its ordinances, religion with its traditions, or any rituals, forms, and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, Galatians shows us that we need to drop all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to leave the law behind, drop the ordinances, cast out religion, bury the traditions, and crucify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christian life is a matter only of Christ, not in an objective way but in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is our life, our person, and the content of all our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ must be fully formed in every area of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will be not only sons of God but also heirs of God, inheriting all that God is for our enjoyment 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not care for the law, because we have God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not have a religion; we have Christ with all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, we do not hold to traditions and ordinances; instead, we have the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BEING CHRIST AS OUR ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we drop all the negative matters and hold only to Christ, we are not confused and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we all are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This oneness is the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Formerly, many of us were scattered in the denominations and free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we can now boast to Satan, saying, Look at the oneness in the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the different kinds of people are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are one not in doctrines, the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, or any fleshly similarity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If all the real Christians would be like this, the kingdom of the heavens would spread throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this case, there would be no need for the United Nations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The earth does not need that kind of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The true oneness is in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord will recover and carry out this oneness, not with the majority of Christians but with a minority as a remnant, in the principle of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may compare the recovery of the church life to the reformation of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Israel was reformed not with all the Jews on the earth but with only a minority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are millions of Jews in New York City alone, but they are not the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The nation of Israel is composed of only the relatively few who returned to the land of their forefathers, remained there, and built it up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same principle, there are millions of Christians today, but as long as they are scattered, divided, and confused, they are not the church in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just as the Jews in New York City are true Jews, all genuine Christians are the members of the Body of Christ, but most of them are still scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, a minority, a small number, a remnant, has been rescued from the divisions and confusion as well as from laws, ordinances, religion, and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus has gathered us here together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as we stand in this oneness, we can tell others, Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the church!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some may ask, Since we are real Christians, are we not also the church?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be sure, all the saved ones are genuine Christians, but many are still scattered in the denominations and divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If they would be rescued from the divisions, they will return to the practicality of the Body, where Christ Himself is our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We ourselves may still be accustomed to certain kinds of ordinances, particularly in the practice of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, we must avoid every ordinance, even those that appear to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are here only for Christ as our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way of the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord is recovering the proper church life, which is a life with Christ, by Christ, in Christ, and for Christ.</S>
