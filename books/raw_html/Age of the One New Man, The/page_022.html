        <h2 class="head2">Exercising Faith to Believe in the Living God</h2>
<p>In order to serve full time, we must learn the lesson of faith and take the way of faith. We do not have an organization, but we have the way of faith. We need to believe that our God is living. After I went to the United States for the work, a brother said that I was able to work by faith in the United States because many churches and saints in the Far East ministered to my needs. Before the Lord, I would like to say that after I started the work in the United States, from 1961 to 1965, not one church in the Far East sent me even a penny. In 1965 I became a United States citizen and needed to pay taxes. A brother, who was an accountant, handled my taxes and found out that the support I received from the church in Los Angeles was about seven hundred dollars a year. Some people may ask how I was able to live without any source of support. My answer is that I live by faith and I take the way of faith. This is not being childish or superstitious. Every full-time serving one must realize that this way is the way of faith.</p>
<p>Those who are burdened to serve full time must be clear that no one will promise to support you. This is the way of faith. If someone cannot take this way of faith, there is no need for him to force himself. If he wants to take this way of serving full time, he must have the grace of the Lord. He may not care whether he has faith but would still willingly and joyfully take this way even if he would starve to death; this is good. When the Lord called me to serve full time, He gave me a clear word that He would care for all my needs. I dared not disbelieve the Lord&rsquo;s word, but I had only partial faith. Inwardly, I said to the Lord, &ldquo;If I will die of hunger, so be it! If I need to, I will eat tree roots and drink from mountain brooks.&rdquo; This word lacked faith. I have been serving the Lord for more than forty years, and He never allowed me to eat tree roots or to drink from mountain brooks. I have had many times of poverty, but I have also had more times of abundance. Some people know that the Lord not only cared for my needs but also enabled me to provide funds for many churches to buy land and build meeting halls. Based on my experience I can say assuredly that those who take this way will not starve to death. Some may not have faith, but as long as they have a heart to take this way whether in life or in death, they can take it, because the way of faith is also the way of being placed in death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking Guidance and Confirmation<br />
through Prayer to the Lord<br />
and Fellowship with the Saints</h2>
<p>Finally, what should we do practically? Those who have a heart should pray and inquire of the Lord concerning the five aspects of our need. In which aspect should you participate? On one hand, you should contact the Lord concerning whether you should serve full time. On the other hand, you should fellowship with the saints around you and ask them whether the gifts and functions constituted into you through the Lord&rsquo;s grace require you to serve full time. If the answer, after praying and fellowshipping with the saints, is positive, you should fellowship with the leading brothers concerning joining the full-time service.</p>
<p>Based on our experience we feel that this is the safest way. We do not have a rigid rule that once someone serves full time, he must do so his whole life. Full-time service is not like marriage, which cannot be changed except through the death of one party. According to the common work practice today, we can have a two-year trial period. During these two years the serving one or other co-workers will realize whether he is suitable for full-time service. It is not easy for a serving one to change his profession after twenty years.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that it is permissible for a person to take a job after serving full time for a period of time. Paul is an example. He had a great gift and the highest function, but when it was necessary, he worked with his own hands by making tents (Acts 18:3; 20:34). Hence, it is not that those who decide to serve full time cannot change but must serve full time their whole life. Some may have to take a job after a few years.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistles reveal that the churches and the saints were not up to the standard. Hence, Paul had to make tents in order to meet his needs and the needs of his fellow workers. In Acts 20:34 he says, &ldquo;These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me,&rdquo; and in 1 Corinthians 4:11 and 12 he says, &ldquo;Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst...and wander without a home; and we labor, working with our own hands.&rdquo; I hope that the churches and the saints will follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The Lord has blessed Taiwan. Because the average national income is increasing, we need to offer more to the Lord. I trust that the Lord will bless us even more. Then the full-time serving ones will not be forced to take a job because of their living necessities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Needing the Full-time Serving Ones<br />
to Cooperate with Him</h2>
<p>May we all pray and seek the Lord concerning serving full time and also fellowship with one another so that the Lord may raise up at least thirty full-time serving ones. The need in the work is great; hence, there must be some strong and useful saints who are willing to offer their time, energy, and strength to meet this need. For the first few years of the work in the United States I was the only one serving full time, but now in almost every major church there, the Lord has raised up some to serve Him full time. The burden of the work is so heavy that it cannot be carried out without full-time serving ones. There is such a need.</p>
<p>There are always some saints who must serve full time because the Lord has given them a special work or commission. If these saints do not serve full time, their function will be consumed by other things. Therefore, we must bring this desire to the Lord in prayer. May the Lord raise up many full-time serving ones among us.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
