He appointed Levites to play psalteries and harps to exalt, thank, and praise God before the ark of His covenant
When Solomon completed the building of Jehovah's temple, the priests carried the ark of the covenant into the Holy of Holies
In the Psalms we can touch the most wounded feelings, and in the Psalms we also can find the greatest and highest praises
God desires much more to see His people writing psalms and praising Him when they 'walk through the valley of the shadow of death'
Hebrews 1315 says Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God that is the fruit of lips confessing His name
In other words, God inflicts wounds; He breaks and cuts a person deeply, yet at the same time, such a person turns to Him and praises Him
If we have not learned to praise God every day, it is hard to have the kind of sacrifice of praise spoken of in Hebrews 13
At that very moment, you should remember that Jehovah's throne has not changed, His name has not changed, and His glory has not changed
You realize that God's throne is established in the heavens and cannot be shaken, and you do not hold back your praise
Many people say that Satan is afraid of the prayers of God's children; he flees whenever God's children kneel down to pray
We will point out another fact: Satan's greatest attacks are not aimed at prayers; his greatest attacks are aimed at praise
God's children are foolish if they stop praising when they suffer under adverse environments and downtrodden feelings
If God takes you above the jail the chains the painful wounds on the body the suffering and the shame you will offer praises to His name
They were brought by God to the point where the jail, the shame, and the pain were no longer a problem to them
When they praised in such a way, the doors of the jail opened, the chains fell off, and even the jailer was saved
Whenever you run out of strength to pray and you find your spirit heavily oppressed, wounded, or sagging, praise Him
When you encounter unusual circumstances and problems and are bewildered and feel like collapsing just remember one thing Why not praise
If you offer your praise at that moment, God's Spirit will operate in you, open all the doors, and break all the chains
Even though their circumstances and wounds try to bury them, they are not willing to be buried, and they try to get out by prayers
When you put yourself in such an overcoming position, you immediately transcend everything, and no problem will be able to bury you
Of course, none of the last kings of Judah was perfect, but nevertheless, Jehoshaphat was a person seeking after God
And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir'
When everyone was singing praises to Jehovah, He rose to smite the Ammonites, Moabites, and the people of Mount Seir
God's children often are tempted to think that their problems are too big and that they have to find some way to deal with their problems
At such times, it is easy for them to turn their attention to their problems; it is easy for their eyes to be set on their own difficulties
New believers should not think that they have to pass through many years before they can learn the lesson of praise
When you have some problems or when you are sorrowful, you pray, and as you pray, a kind of faith rises up in your heart
Do this until you turn from having no feeling to having feeling, or from having a feeble feeling to a strong feeling
When our prayer reaches the point where we have faith and assurance we know that the Lord has answered our prayer and we should praise Lord!
When you praise the Lord this way, your spirit will soar above your problems; it will soar above your inner wounds
The more others try to put us down, the more we should rise up before the Lord and say, 'I thank You and praise You'!
We need to learn not only to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit but also to praise the discipline of the Holy Spirit
We can only feel the pain of all the inward wounds and outward trials that we have encountered and experienced
If some of our footsteps had not been stopped by the Holy Spirit, we cannot imagine how pitiful our fall would have been!
Many things, thousands and even millions of things which we do not see today, will become clear to us on that day
What we encountered may have been a misfortune, but through that encounter we may have avoided greater misfortunes
When our eyes are opened and we become clear on that day, how very shameful we will be when we recall our murmurings
Today we have to learn to believe that the Lord is good and that He is never wrong, even though we cannot always understand what He is doing
