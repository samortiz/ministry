   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Indeed, our brother's problem is his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is bound by his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Anyone who is bound by his emotion will feel happy when his emotion is up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our brother is bound by his emotion, yet he is suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said that he was deeply affected by his environment when he was young.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would like our brother to see that the world does not have the time to ridicule you constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not sit idly by and pick on you constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is your thought that tells you others are paying too much attention to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In reality, no one may have paid that much attention to you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We often are too self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In actuality no one has the time to try to purposely despise you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Others may have ignored you, but they may not have been despising, disdaining, or mocking you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The truth is that others do not have that much time and energy to pay attention to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may have certain feelings about how others treat you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But others may not be paying attention to you at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You think too highly of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are too self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are so concerned about the attention of others that a martyr's complex has developed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people have a martyr's complex, and it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In following the Lord, we can never be bound by our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to be decisive about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot be concerned about so many things and be bound by them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are bound by many small matters, our time will be wasted on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will not be strong, and our way will not be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are constantly on the defensive about themselves cannot run the race properly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you were in Shanghai, I fellowshipped with Brother Witness Lee about your desire to serve full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were concerned that you do not know what it means to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You do not know how high the sky above you is or how thick the earth below you is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the reason you should wait for a while and learn your lesson through taking a secular job in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This would work out to your benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later I allowed you to come to the mountain because I did not want you suffer too much shock and thus be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I granted your request to come because we wanted you to receive the help.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But I did not grant your request to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man does not enter God's work lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if a man is not given the chance to work, how can he serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I feel that our brother will eventually end up serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A believer serves because there is a serving life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No matter what his pathway turns out to be, he will always end up serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every Christian has a certain sustaining power which carries him through his present life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, a person who loves his mother derives much of his meaning of existence from his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The strength behind his life is his beloved mother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If one day his mother no longer loves him or if she dies, he will lose all interest in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The driving force behind some people is money; it is their sole interest in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they have much money, they find interest in everything they do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they lose their money, they lose interest in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Money is the driving force behind their life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every person has something to interest and attract him in his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has to maintain this motivating force and the power of attraction because it is the meaning and essence of his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some consider their intellectual activity to be the essence of their human life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The driving force behind Brother Sun is his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he cannot get what he wants, he shrivels away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He likes to work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as he can work, he will live.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His work is based on his love of work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If this love is taken away from him, his emotion is taken away, and he no longer will be able to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A Christian should have the Holy Spirit as the driving force behind his life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Emotions can shrivel away, but we still have to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is wrong for our brother to be driven by his interest in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot live by our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is wrong even to borrow the appeal of the emotion for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In our service to the Lord we must not be influenced by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The driving force behind our life must come from the interest we derive from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your self-centeredness has to be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The power of your emotion has to be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You have to reject your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have no more time to take care of your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You have to dismantle everything that is related to your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether you feel happy or unhappy, poor or rich, you should ignore your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As a Christian you have to act decisively.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nothing should be a problem to you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A believer must learn to ignore his feelings as well as his anxiety for a lack of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You said that you have been confused and stunned after coming to Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Actually, you are not confused and stunned enough.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you could be genuinely confused and stunned during this period of time on the mountain, it would be wonderful indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will be blessed if you become completely ignorant of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You will be blessed if you become too weak to stand up any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is a difference between jumping down and falling down.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When a person jumps down, he is conscious of what he is doing; it is a conscious choice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But when a person falls down, he does it unconsciously; he has no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When your fall becomes genuine, you will commit everything fully into God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You will say to the Lord, "I commit everything to Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I do not know what to do anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then the Lord will begin His work on you.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord does not tear down for the sake of tearing down; He tears down for the sake of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All the tearing down of the Lord is for the purpose of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord does not want you merely to die, but to pass from death to life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A person who has genuinely fallen does not need to know about his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All you have to do is tell the Lord that you cannot make it, and the Lord will do the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our brother has to be more natural in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There are many reasons for speaking in an unnatural way, such as fear, concerns, pretensions, unfamiliarity, etc. When you are unnatural, the spirit is choked.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Therefore, we have to reject all fear, concerns, and pretensions.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The spiritual pathway is a long one, and spiritual responsibility is a heavy one.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We cannot retreat, and we cannot lurch ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We can only look to the Lord for His leading and grace that we would learn our lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Many young people think that the Lord's work is easy and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Such ones are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord will only use those who wait in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The more a person considers the work to be a simple task, the less he will be used by God.</S>
