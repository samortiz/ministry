   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE TRANSFORMATION AND CONFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE GRAFTED LIFE 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As believers in Christ, our relationship with the Lord is wholly a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning with 5:10, Paul has much to say about life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse he says that we shall be saved in His life, and in 5:17, that we shall reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 6:4 he says, Even so we also should walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 8:2 Paul speaks of the Spirit of life, and in 8:10 he says that our spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the mind set on the spirit is life 8:6 , and the divine life is imparted into our mortal bodies through the Spirit of Him who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD S GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the growth and function of the divine life within us, God will reach His goal to produce many sons to form the Body to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today Christ, the Son of God, is no longer simply the only begotten Son, but also the firstborn among many brothers 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the firstborn Son, He is the prototype and pattern of sonship for all who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, all the sons of God will form a living organism, the Body, to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through the expression of Christ in the Body, the Father is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is related to righteousness and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Righteousness is the beginning, the foundation, sanctification is the process, and glory is the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The process by which we are brought fully into glory is altogether a matter of transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE HUMAN LIFE AND THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life by which we are transformed is a grafted life, the mingling of the human life with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to God s sovereignty in creation, the human life is similar to the divine life, just as a glove is similar to a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unless there is a hand, the glove has no purpose and is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same principle, unless it contains God, the human life is purposeless and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The human life was created in the image of the divine life and according to the likeness of the divine life for the purpose of containing the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If it does not contain the divine life, the human life is like an empty glove that has no purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The meaning of human life is to contain the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The human life is complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only was it created by God, but it has become fallen, corrupted, and mixed with devilish, satanic things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, the good element created by God remains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, God loves the complicated human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to be received by the human life, the divine life had to pass through a process involving incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through incarnation Christ put on a physical body so that He could shed His blood for our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the cross, He not only accomplished redemption, but also terminated all the negative things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After crucifixion and burial, He entered into resurrection with His divine elements and was then able to germinate, generate, and transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, in His ascension Christ has been exalted, glorified, and enthroned and has been given the headship, the lordship, and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the divine life is fully qualified and prepared to be received by the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day we received the divine life into us, a wonderful marriage took place in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was the marriage of the human life and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By means of this marriage we have become very special people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason that in 1 Corinthians 3 Paul tells us that all things are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We who have a life that is married to the divine life are the center, the focal point, of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within our being we have experienced the grafting of the human life to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The mingling of these two lives will produce proper sons for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through this mingled and grafted life we shall be fully transformed and conformed to the image of God s firstborn Son.</S>
