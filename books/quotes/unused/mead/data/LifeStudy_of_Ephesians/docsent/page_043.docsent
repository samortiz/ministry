   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION A. Our Regenerated Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Indwelt by the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to have revelation, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit in verse 17 must be our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a spirit is given to us by God that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, the spirit in this verse is the mingled spirit, the regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the emphasis is upon our regenerated spirit, not on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Wisdom Being the Ability</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>to Understand in Our Spirit That</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We May Know the Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wisdom is in our spirit that we may know the mystery of God, and revelation is of God s Spirit to show us the vision by opening the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We firstly have wisdom, the ability to understand spiritual things; then the Spirit of God reveals the spiritual things to our spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Wisdom is different from cleverness and deeper than cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible to be very clever, yet not be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Cleverness is in the mind, but wisdom is mainly in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our need is to be wise in our spirit, not to be clever in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem with certain saints is that they are very clever in the mind, but lack wisdom in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was a brother like this in Shanghai in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was a good business man, very clever at making money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In his business he sold women s hats, especially to British women.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day a wealthy woman was not interested in a particular hat because she thought the price was too low.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brother went to the back of the shop, changed the ribbon on the hat, and doubled the price.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that price, the woman was happy to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By this we see what a clever merchant this brother was.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although he was clever in business, he was lacking in wisdom and could not understand when we spoke about the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His mind was very active, but his spirit was not keen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, this brother had a heart for the Lord, came to the meetings of the church, and trusted in us for everything concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was an excellent example of the difference between cleverness and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us also give an example of one who had wisdom, but not much cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1938 I visited the countryside in northern China, where most of the people had little education.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among them was a certain elderly sister.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although she was not educated, she was very wise concerning the things of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever you spoke with her about the Lord, she was wise in her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In talking about business this sister had no understanding, but in talking about the Lord she knew much more than most saints because she had wisdom in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>C. Revelation Being the Opening</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>of the Veil by God s Spirit to Show Us</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>the Vision of the Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After wisdom comes revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we have pointed out, revelation means unveiling, the opening of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation is of God s Spirit to show us the vision of the mystery of God 3:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose you are studying engineering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through your years of study you gain knowledge of various machines.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This knowledge may be compared to wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day you visit a factory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As soon as the doors are opened, you see all the machines.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The opening of the doors can be compared to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because of your wisdom, your knowledge of these machines, you spontaneously have an understanding of them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, someone who does not have this engineering knowledge would not understand anything about these machines, although he would also be able to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He would have the revelation, but be short of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some may have the wisdom without the opening of the door; others may have the opening of the door without wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only when we have both wisdom and revelation do we have the understanding of the machines.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The same is true regarding spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need both wisdom and the opening of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we have both, we can understand spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>D. In the Full Knowledge of Him</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we have wisdom and revelation, we have the full knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know God in a full way.</S>
