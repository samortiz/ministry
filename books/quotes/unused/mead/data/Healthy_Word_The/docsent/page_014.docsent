   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S ECONOMY An Economy Being a Stewardship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and an Administration for Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to see what God s economy is, we need to consider each instance in which the word economy is used in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Economy in the New Testament does not mean what we understand by the modern usage of economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word economy in the New Testament is not a translation but an anglicized Greek word that means stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In ancient times large, wealthy families had stewards to take care of the household affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Stewardship is the title of the service of a steward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word for economy also indicates an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a large family the stewardship was an administration; the stewards administrated the affairs of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word also indicates the dispensing of certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the supplies of a large family, such as food and clothing, were taken care of by the steward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, there was the need of the dispensing of these supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The steward served the family by dispensing the necessities of life to the members of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the word economy means a stewardship as an administration to dispense the life necessities to the members of a household.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s Economy Being</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the Dispensing of Christ to</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All God s Chosen People as Their Supply</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has a large family, a great household, and He has a number of stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul wrote to the Ephesians, If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you Eph 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul s ministry, which was part of this stewardship, was to dispense Christ as the supply to all those in God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s economy is simply the dispensing of Christ to all God s chosen people as their life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, God s economy is simply to work Christ into God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the apostles, from Peter to Timothy, were stewards in this one stewardship, dispensing Christ to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament Books</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not Teaching Different Things but Teaching Different Aspects of One Person Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entire New Testament was written to carry out God s economy to dispense Christ as the life supply to the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are twenty-seven books from various writers, but these books do not teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Apparently, the four Gospels are different from one another, but actually, they all teach Christ, only from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This may be likened to taking four photos of one person from four different sides.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Each photo will show different aspects of the person, but together they will give a complete picture of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The twenty-seven books in the New Testament teach different aspects of one person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament deals uniquely with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this one person is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the sequence in the four Gospels, He is a king, a servant, a man, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning who He is, we can list many different titles, such as Redeemer, Savior, Lord, Master, Creator, Shepherd, Bridegroom, and High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Concerning what He is, He is the life, the light, the way, the truth, the door, the pasture, the water, the bread of life, and the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Colossians 2:16-17 every positive thing in the universe is a shadow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The light we see with our eyes is not the real light; the real light is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The real air and the real food are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reality of every positive thing in the universe is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 16 tells us that Christ is the new moon, a light appearing in the darkest, blackest, most hopeless time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is this new beginning in the midst of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we are in a dark time, we should not be disappointed but realize that Christ is our bright new beginning at that very moment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is also our feast, a time of special enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Also, Christ is the real Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the new man, which is the Body of Christ, the church, Christ is all and in all 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because Christ is all in the new man, we all must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church there are no natural persons; we are all crucified Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church we are all constituted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not Teaching Myths,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Genealogies, the Law, or Philosophy</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul s exhortation in 1 Timothy 1:3-4 indicates that even in the first century there were different teachings; some were teaching things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These different teachings included myths, which are different kinds of interesting stories.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Young and old people alike all like to hear interesting stories.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The stranger and more peculiar the story is, the more we like it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Besides myths, some also taught unending genealogies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 7 indicates that there were teachers of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Colossians 2:8 reveals that there were also teachers of Greek philosophy, referring to Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While the apostle Paul was still on the earth, different teachings had already crept in. All the apostles from Peter to Timothy taught the same thing, God s economy, which is to dispense Christ into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ for the church is the unique topic of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Anything else is a different teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, even as early as the first century, other teachings crept in besides the one teaching concerning Christ for the church.</S>
