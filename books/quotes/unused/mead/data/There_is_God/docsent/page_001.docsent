   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE IS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is the unique book in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first subject covered in the Bible is God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the main theme of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first verse in the Bible says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Scientists have explored our physical universe for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through their studies they have discovered that our universe is an orderly system that is full of design.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before we consider what the Bible has to say about God, let us first consider what the universe has to say about God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD DECLARED THROUGH THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Look at the sky above you at night.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Astronomers estimate that there are more than one hundred billion stars in our galaxy, and that there may be billions of galaxies in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each star we see represents a solar system in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our own solar system has the sun as the center, and it has nine planets revolving around it in clock-like precision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The earth, as one of the planets, speeds through space at 67,000 miles an hour and takes 365 days to circle the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This fact is astounding when one considers that a train traveling at one-one thousandth of this speed will many times miss its schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the moon in its motion around the earth has its orbit and period.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The earth's rotation and the twenty-three degree tilt of its axis give us our twenty- four-hour day, our four seasons, and our many different climates.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The movements of the sun, the moon, and the earth give us our wonderful calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The distances between the sun, the moon, and the earth provide a marvelous environment for life to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the earth were to come ten percent closer to or farther away from the sun, all living beings on earth would be either scorched to death or frozen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the moon were 50,000 miles from the earth instead of 230,000 miles from it, all the oceans on earth would be sucked up by the moon; the land mass would be deluged, and the mountains would be submerged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The precise distances and circulations of the sun, the moon, and the earth tell us of a wonderful design that is in place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And these are but a tiny fraction of the movement of the heavenly bodies above us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a wonderful testimony displayed in the universe around us is a living witness to the existence of a Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law of cause and effect tells us that for every phenomenon there must be a cause.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a watch keeps time accurately, there must be a watchmaker who made it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a house stands magnificently on a hill, there must be a builder who built it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a garden is well-trimmed and fenced, there must be a gardener who is taking care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, the obvious design behind the universe speaks of a Creator who has caused these things to appear the way they are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In physics there is the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that any physical system left to itself will decay and become disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet the processes that operate in the universe, and particularly on earth, remain highly organized.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is order and design in everything that we see.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For such order and design to come out of nothing would surely defy the natural law stated above.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Dr. Boris P. Dotsenko, once the head of the nuclear physics department in the Institute of Physics in Kiev, who was taught in atheism, wrote in relation to the earth being what it is in spite of the Second Law: "As I thought about all of that, it suddenly dawned on me that there must be a very powerful organizing force counteracting this disorganizing tendency within nature, keeping the universe controlled and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This force must not be material; otherwise, it too would become disordered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I concluded that this power must be both omnipotent and omniscient.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There must be a God one God controlling everything!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Throughout history some people have at times opposed the idea of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The very fact that they have opposed it means that God is there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact that some rebellious sons disown their fathers means that they do have a father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fact that some people try to tear down the family means that the family is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The law of inference tells us that opposition to anything presupposes that the thing itself exists.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It has been proven in history that it is futile to oppose the idea of God, for no matter how cultures and human governments change, the belief in God always prevails in the end.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us consider what the universe tells us about God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible tells us that God's "eternal power and divine characteristics" are seen through the creation Rom 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a painting displays the characteristics of the painter, so the Creator's attributes are manifested through His created universe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although man cannot say much about God Himself, through the majesty displayed in the creation he can see that God is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Psalm 19:1 says that "the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of His hands."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The material universe speaks of God's glory, and it also speaks of His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The God who created the universe is powerful, glorious, and wise.</S>
