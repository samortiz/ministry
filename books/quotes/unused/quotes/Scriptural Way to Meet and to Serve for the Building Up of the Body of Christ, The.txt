Lord, fill this hall with Yourself that we may be gathered into Your name, into Your Person, into Your presence
We need to be impressed that the meetings of the believers should always be linked to God's New Testament economy
God's New Testament economy is to have a people to be the Body of Christ for a corporate expression of the processed Triune God
The Triune God came down from the heavens and passed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
Our God became a man in His incarnation, and as a man He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years
In His first thirty years He lived as a poor Nazarene in a poor carpenter's home in the despised village of Nazareth
His living in a carpenters home for thirty years day after day week after week month after month and year after year is a wonderful mystery
The third step of this process was the all-inclusive crucifixion, the all-inclusive death that Christ passed through
By His death every negative thing in the universe was dealt with , His life was released , and the church was redeemed
We are meeting here with His incarnation, with His human living, with His all-inclusive death, with His resurrection, and with His ascension
We should come to the meeting with a vision that He has accomplished an all-inclusive death to terminate all the negative things
Our self, our flesh, our natural man, and all that we are as descendants of Adam have been crucified on the cross
We also need to come to the meeting with a vision that He is now in resurrection, and in Him and with Him we are also in resurrection
We are coming to the meeting in incarnation as God-men, as those who have been mingled with God and who have God living in them
God's New Testament economy is for the heading up of all things in Christ through the church as the Body of Christ
As we meet we are taking step after step to lead all the created things toward one direction, that is, to be headed up in Christ
One day the church will bring all the created things to one direction, that is, to the heading up of all things in Christ
It is very difficult for a young lady, after being married, to submit herself to her husband, taking the male as her head
Paul tells us that 'the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God'
It testifies and declares that we are taking the lead in all of God's creation to reach the goal of the heading up of all things in Christ
In order to have the church meetings, we must first see that the church has been redeemed by the death of Christ
The church is a group of extraordinary, peculiar people , a people privately possessed by God as His peculiar treasure , His own possession
The Body of Christ is not composed of different races such as American or Chinese, but it is an aggregate of the sons of God
They were fighting because they were meeting there not only as the sons of Adam but also as the sons of the Devil
When Christ was walking on this earth, He was walking as one who had God the Father in Him, with His life and nature
Some brothers may have quarreled with one another in some meetings because they forgot that they were meeting as sons of God
If we do not add one to our meeting number, we forget about the Lord Jesus Christ, who is really meeting with us
The meetings should be linked with such a resurrected Christ, who is now both in the heavens and in us to make us persons in resurrection
In the traditional way we were never helped to realize that the Christian meetings should be linked with the resurrected and ascended Christ
Christ is meeting with His brothers in the church in resurrection to declare the Father's name to His brothers
The Son would also make us realize that God's economy is His arrangement or plan to have a group of sons to express Him
Before the resurrection of Christ, the disciples' relationship with God was nearly the same as the other creatures
When this family gathers together with all their pets, these creatures are not related at all to the father in life or in nature
Christ meets with His brothers in the church to praise the Father with and in the brothers in the midst of the church
When the Lord Jesus is speaking within me, when He is speaking in my speaking, this speaking is a praise to the Father
Let us ask the Father to be merciful to us Texans by reducing the oil production of the Arabs that our oil may sell more'
If we have the revelation that our meeting is linked to the resurrected Christ, we would never talk about things like this
We must also have our meetings in the reality of Christ's resurrection-in the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ
It may be hard for us to know when we are in the Spirit, but it is easy for us to realize when we are not in the Spirit
When we realize that we are not speaking in the Spirit and life of Christ, we have to drop this kind of speaking
We have to change our way of speaking until we have the assurance that we are not speaking according to our natural life
The Christian meetings are to make God's economy in His fatherhood known to the believers for the praise of the Father
In time He came to call us, to grasp us, to gain us, while we were busy in worldly affairs or involved in sinful things
Perhaps we wanted to enjoy ourselves where we were and put off believing in the Lord Jesus for a number of years
Whenever a brother speaks with God's utterance in the ministry of the word, the Son makes the fatherhood known to the believers
Today we are enjoying a miniature of the fatherhood, and one day we will be in the full taste of the fatherhood
Abraham had two sons: Ishmael who was eventually excluded from Abraham's family and Isaac who was Abraham's unique seed
The more they talked about these things, the more they gave praises to that great old man and the more they expressed him and manifested him
If we all see this vision of the fatherhood, everyone will have something to say when they come to the meeting
We went week after week to listen to speaking that was a waste as far as our development in life and function was concerned
Recently the big denominations in the United States came together to talk about how to evangelize the entire world by the year 2000
According to statistics on religious bodies in the United States, there were approximately one hundred twenty-six million Christians in 1986
If our heavenly Father came to a Christian meeting where His children did not speak, He might feel to rebuke them in the same way
We can say, 'I was begotten of our Father about two thousand years ago, and God's only begotten Son has become my big Brother!
The Lord's recovery has been in the United States for twenty-five years, and we have published hundreds of messages
Whatever we do and say in the meetings should declare the Father in order that the Father may be praised, magnified, manifested, expressed
Our meeting is for the praise of the Father-for the magnification and glorification of the very source of the divine Trinity
Knowing that a particular brother was going to speak, all the saints would come to the meeting to listen and relax
On the Lord's Day this speaker came to the meeting under a heavy burden, while all the other believers rested and relaxed
If this type of meeting had taken place only three months a year, there would have been nine months left for the saints to practice speaking
When we began to practice the biblical way to meet, the way ordained by the apostle, certain ones became concerned
The function of the listeners will become annulled, and spiritually speaking, they will lose the ability of their speaking organ
A little babe needs to hear his parents speaking for a period of time before he can make the appropriate sounds
Following this she may teach the baby to say 'pa,' and after a period of time the baby will begin to call his father 'pa'
Sometimes one saint would read only half of a sentence, and another saint would spontaneously continue this sentence
We need to be like the mothers who teach their little ones to exercise their function which they received at their birth
Eventually, refreshments were brought out of the kitchen and the saints began to talk about things other than Christ
Use the entire meeting hall to teach the saints so that they can practice and learn to develop their organic function
Brother Watchman Nee said that this old way to meet with a definite speaker and the others listening had become a strong habit
Because this old way was too heavy for one person to remove, Brother Nee said that we needed many brothers to push
We must prepare ourselves throughout the day in the easy way by speaking the verses we read in the morning during the entire day
You do not need to speak too long when you share in the meeting-about one to three minutes at most is sufficient
When you are listening to others, on the other hand, learn not to overly appreciate anyone nor to despise anyone
According to Ephesians 5:18-21, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing but also for speaking
We must come to the meeting with a spirit filled with Christ to praise and thank God the Father and to edify and build up the attendants
The saints come to the church meetings to learn to know, enjoy, and receive Christ and the things related to God
To teach in the way of ministering Christ is for the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ
Some sisters in certain places may come to the meetings to teach others how to eat vitamins, take herbs, and get the proper exercise
You have to limit your speaking and concentrate your speaking on Christ, the church, and other things related to God
We have the Holy Bible in our hands and publications such as the Life-studies and Life Lessons that open up the Bible
We should learn to speak God, speak Christ, speak the word of the Lord, speak salvation, and speak the life supply to the young believers
When we come to the meeting, we should have something of the Lord to minister to others from the items listed in 1 Corinthians 14:26
In the past, Christian teachers made a mistake by telling people that it is very difficult to be filled with the Spirit
Some taught that one must fast and pray for a certain period of time and fulfill other requirements in order to be filled with the Spirit
After a person was regenerated, they said that he must have the fullness of the Spirit, which was the second blessing
If someone had the first blessing, they would rejoice over him, and if someone had the second blessing, they would rejoice even more
When a sinner hears the gospel, repents of his sins, and calls on the name of the Lord, he is instantly regenerated
At a certain point in his prayer something clicks like the click of a camera taking a picture and the divine scenery of Christ gets into him
Moody said that regeneration was the biggest miracle in the universe, but he also illustrated that it was instantaneous
After one of his gospel preaching meetings, he came down from the platform to talk to a lady who was a new one
As long as you have finished a thorough confession of your sins, you have to realize that you have been filled with the Spirit
If we would confess all of our failures and make a thorough confession, we will immediately have joy and peace within
Another requirement on the believers for their meetings is that they must live and walk according to the spirit-to live a victorious life
We must begin to have a new life, and this new life is to have our being absolutely in the spirit day after day and all day
For our meetings, we also need to be those who speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion
Regardless of the situation or circumstances, we have to speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion
For our meetings, we must become acquainted with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for teaching and admonishing one another
We may not be able to remember that many, but we can choose to remember the better hymns and learn to speak them
It would be good if we would make a pledge to speak for at least forty seconds whenever we are in any kind of meeting
If we come to the meeting outside of Him, we come dead, empty, and without anything to minister to others as a praise to the Father
Whenever we come together, we come into a Person; therefore, we must be gathered out of our occupations and frustrations
If we keep ourselves in fellowship with the Lord, He will surely rescue us from these occupations and frustrations
The meeting should be in a person, and all things other than the Lord Himself should be kept away, left behind, or dropped
We are gathered out of all the occupations and frustrations into the living Person of the Lord, signified by His name
Frequently, this trouble may be in the form of phone calls which come right before we are leaving to go to the meeting
The Lord is our Rescuer and He can rescue us from every kind of frustration and occupation, but He needs our cooperation
Regardless of how good the meetings might be, we occasionally lose our taste, and become tired or disinterested
Whenever we feel tired, disinterested, or reluctant to go to the meetings, this indicates that we have been defeated by the enemy
If we would pray in this way, the Lord would immediately strengthen us, stir us up, and give us an appetite to go to the meeting
It is not that we go to the meeting; rather, it is that the Lord rescues us from being absent from the meeting
Nearly everywhere among the churches today, the prayer meeting is the meeting with the smallest number in attendance
For the Hebrew believers to forsake their Christian meeting was for them to forsake the Holy of Holies and go back to their religious camp
Moses knew that God, according to His holiness, would no longer stay among the people for the camp had become idolatrous
If the people would not go out of the camp but would remain in it, they would not have the presence of the Lord
Outside of and around Christ, there was a religious organization, an old religion, a camp, which did not have God's Holy of Holies
At the time the Lord Jesus walked upon this earth, the proper worship was always held in the temple according to the rituals ordained by God
At that time, if anyone desired to worship God, they had to forsake the temple and go to that little home in Bethany
In order to worship God, you have to go outside of the camp of religion and enter within the veil to enjoy Christ in the Holy of Holies
The heavens are difficult to reach, and we are often unable to remain in our spirit all day long, day and night
If they forsook their assembling together, it meant that they went back to their old religion, their former camp
The Christian meeting is the best because it nourishes, strengthens, edifies, and enlightens us, becoming a great spiritual benefit to us
The assembling together of the believers, the meetings, should not be in the nature of fulfilling mixed purposes
If we hold a meeting which is not pure and which has a mixed purpose, it would be difficult to have the Lord's presence
God's New Testament economy is to get a people through Christ to be the church that God may have a corporate expression in His fatherhood
By this practice of everyone speaking according to their measure, we all would produce a meeting that is full of mutuality
They may have been Christians for many years, but they may never have seen a meeting with such mutuality-with everyone speaking
If we all learn to give living and weighty words whenever and wherever we speak, we will surely be welcomed by all of the churches
On the other hand, if we go to the meetings and only sit without saying anything, we will not be appreciated that much
On the other hand, if you only listen to others' speaking, it does nourish you but it does not allow you to grow
It is linked to Christ who has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension'
Chapter one of this book is enough for the saints in the churches to speak on for one year, day by day and in every meeting
According to 1 Corinthians 115 however women may pray and prophesy in the meeting but they must do this under the covering of the brothers
Many times, mothers can admonish their children better than fathers; likewise, the sisters are usually very skillful in admonishing
We must endeavor to reach this highest standard so that our meetings could be revolutionized, bearing the proper characteristics
Once our meetings are converted from the old way into the new way, the Lord will have something according to His New Testament economy
In chapter two we saw that we needed to meet according to the way ordained by the apostle in 1 Corinthians 14:26
Whenever we come together each one has something-either a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation
In the nineteenth century the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in England to recover many of the truths in the Bible
Everyone should have something of the Lord or for the Lord to minister to present to the meeting for the mutual enjoyment of the attendants
At the same time their mutual enjoyment was also with God, and their enjoyment with God and before God was the real worship
In chapter one we illustrated that the Christian meeting is like the birthday of a great father with hundreds of descendants
Fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Watchman Nee began to see that the traditional Sunday morning meeting is absolutely of the Gentiles
He pointed us to 2 Kings 17:8 and said that the traditional way of meeting was according to the customs of the nations, the Gentiles
These idol worshippers may have been very talkative in their homes, but when they came to the idol temple everyone had to be dumb
Mainly, only one professional in the meetings of Christianity is talkative, speaking and speaking throughout the year, year after year
There is the feeling that the Christians who are 'laymen' do not know what to speak and they may speak wrongly
When you bring an unbelieving Gentile to the Lord and ask him to speak immediately after his salvation, he may be frightened
A busy banker who has been working hard all week may feel that this place of worship is the best place for him to be relaxed
Even a mother with many children may feel that the cathedral is a calm, silent place where she can escape from the noise and crying at home
After the singing, a certain pastor or reverend would offer a prayer and take care of the Scripture reading in a professional manner
Regardless of how wonderful the content is, our way to practice the meetings is somewhat similar to the practice of Christianity
His illustrations are not very good, his voice is too low, he is not so eloquent, and he does not know the Bible very well'
In this kind of meeting however there was hardly any exercise on the part of the saints for them to have the development in the divine life
In order to maintain our physical life, we need to eat, but in order to develop properly, we must also exercise
Basically speaking, the children in the United States have grown so big and have been so healthy because of good eating and good exercise
About thirty years ago in Manila, a group of brothers among us went to visit a person who was sick in the hospital
Generally speaking, hardly anyone learns how to pray when they are in the traditional way of meeting and serving
He pointed out that the scriptural way to meet was in 1 Corinthians 14:26, but we did not find a way to carry out what he saw
Brother Nee also pointed out that this traditional way had become a strong habit, a strong custom, deeply rooted in the believers' hearts
In other words, after a period of time a habit becomes a custom, and after another period of time a custom becomes a statute
Nee firstly said that this traditional way to meet was a habit a custom and he secondly said that we do not have anything to replace it
Even though he saw this matter as early as 1937, there was no attempt to practice the scriptural way of meeting for eleven years
In 1949, the year after Brother Nee released this word, mainland China was lost into the hands of the Communists
The saints migrated to Orange County, California in 1974 and within ten years up to 1984 the churches there had very little increase
Most agree with the scriptural way, but deep within them they still have a preference for the traditional way of meeting
When people attend the traditional and natural worship service, there is no need for them to have any preparation
In the Sunday morning meeting of today's Christianity, there may be many persons in attendance who are living in a sinful condition
Some might have even gained some money in an unrighteous way and they would give some of it to the church as a gift
If we Christians are going to take the biblical way as seen in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we all have to get ourselves prepared
Even if our conscience does not bother us, we still will not have anything to speak if we do not get ourselves properly prepared
He will not have the peace, the joy, and the anointing within him that gives him the boldness to say something for the Lord
He may have something to say about the Lord, but he will not have the peace within until he makes a thorough confession
He will have the peace, the joy, the anointing through the cleansing of the blood, and thus the freedom in the Spirit to speak
If we want to worship God in the biblical way, we have to be dealt with, cleansed, washed, forgiven, and filled with the heavenly wine
We have to accumulate this experience day after day; then we will have a storage of the riches of Christ that we can speak in the meetings
Before coming into the Lord's recovery, many of us did not know that we had a human spirit, an organ created by God for His worship
If you say 'O Lord Jesus' twenty times, the Lord will have a way to set you on fire, to make you burning in spirit
It would be correct for the elders to respond, 'Dear brother, if we stop that kind of meeting, we will not know how to meet'
Meanwhile, the leading ones should do their best to teach, to train, and to help all the saints to practice the new way
One local church closed the meeting hall on the Lord's Day morning and sent the saints to meet in small groups in the homes
Do not impose something on others who have not yet practiced the truth concerning the scriptural way to meet and to serve
Week after week Sunday after Sunday a certain portion was read from the Bible as a subject yet yearround there was no change in the people
Not many had a real burden for the Lord's Day meeting, and most of the attendants came to the meeting as a matter of routine
Some places may have been different, but many of the elders admitted that the church where they were had entered into a dormant situation
The traditional way is also a way of mixture, mixing the fleshly with the spiritual and the heavenly with the earthly
Too many fleshly activities are merged into the spiritual things, and quite an amount of earthly element is blended with the heavenly things
Another aspect of the traditional way to meet and to serve, which looks very good but is not so encouraging, is the preaching of the gospel
Its way of preaching the gospel also accommodates the poor situation and dead condition of the function-annulled and life-choked Christians
In this way, there is no need of the development of the spiritual function of all the members of the Body of Christ
In principle, we should not try to gain people from the denominations, but we should try to help people from among the Gentiles to be saved
The first point we studied and investigated thoroughly was how to be effective in visiting people by knocking on their doors
The traditional way has bound and annulled the organic function of the members of the Body of Christ for many centuries
In the traditional way, can we see the building up of the Body of Christ mentioned in verse 12 or particularly in verse 16?
In the traditional way of Christianity, we cannot see the function of every joint of the supply or the operation of each one part
Although we are in the Lord's recovery, we must admit that we have not realized very much of the building up of the Body of Christ
In the past two years, we studied the statistics of all the major denominations in the United States and England
It is better to wait in the living room until the meal is prepared and set upon the table perhaps with a very colorful arrangement
The scriptural way, since it is against the religious life and social customs, could not be pleasant to the natural man's feelings
Throughout the whole day we should continually abide in the Lord, live the Lord, and walk and move according to the spirit
You must be clear about this, and you must steadily take the scriptural way and endeavor to accomplish something
The Lord will have a free way to go on within a short period of time to build up a new habit in the church life
A brother who went back to that country reported that not only was the door-knocking effective, but also the church meetings were very good
Recently he became excited and shouted that he was happy, not only because sinners were saved, but also because the saints had been revived
In Taipei, after only three terms of training of four months each, we have baptized thirty-eight thousand people
Because we did not have enough workers to care for each one of them, we were only able to care for about six thousand of these new ones
Out of this number we now have over three thousand meeting together at least once a week, and over two thousand others meeting occasionally
Out of this forty-five hundred, over seven hundred regularly meet once or more a week, and over another seven hundred meet occasionally
In September of 1987, the Chinese-speaking saints were burdened to have a gospel festival in the San Gabriel Valley in California
The foregoing statistics prove that the way of preaching the gospel by knocking on people's doors is prevailing
Exercise your faith to believe that the ascended Christ is with you as the One who has been given all authority in heaven and on earth
You will be able to tell the whole universe, 'I am going out, not by myself, but with Him who is sovereign over the heavens and the earth
If you do not go out to visit people by knocking on their doors, it may be that you are not so willing to sacrifice
Without such a dealing before the Lord, with the Lord, and in the Lord, we could never go out in such a strong way
If we pay the price and sacrifice much, we will surely go out with Christ, with the Triune God, and full of power, authority, and boldness
Rather, we will be desperate to knock on doors and tell people that we have a heavenly commission to pass on to them the Triune God
In chapters four and five, we presented a clear picture of the old way, the traditional way, to meet and to serve
If we seek to gain the increase in a worldly, natural way, that will bring in a real mixture which will kill the Body
The Lord said that we have to bear fruit; otherwise, we will be cut off from the vine tree and thrown away to be burned
We have experimented and studied the way to carry out this preaching by visiting people and have found that it is more than successful
Even while we were in this transitory period of learning how to spread the gospel effectively, we bore much fruit
According to the parable of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13, the tares are sown in the midst of the wheat
As long as they have called on the Lord and have believed into Him, we can say according to the Scriptures that they have to be baptized
According to our observation, however, we have seen a great number of positive ones among the thirty-eight thousand baptized in Taipei
The brothers who gave the messages in their locality had to study things that were already printed in Brother Nee's books and my books
The saints went to the big meetings again and again week after week Lords Day after Lords Day to hear these things repeated again and again
One brother testified that he had been a leading one in the Lord's recovery for twenty years without bringing anyone to the Lord
If we endeavor to have the proper meeting according to the New Testament way, every meeting will be not only nourishing but also cherishing
Ephesians 5:29 tells us that Jesus Christ, our Head, nourishes and cherishes His Body, the church, but how does He do this?
Even though we talked about life again and again, there was not that much life ministered to the attendants in our meetings
Only the way to meet according to God's New Testament economy is able to cherish and nourish people in the spirit
According to the old way of meeting, there is not much raising of the members of Christ in the way that parents raise their children
As long as you can feed your children adequately, that lays a foundation and gives you the opportunity to do anything with your children
If you enjoy the Lord in two verses in the morning, what you speak from your enjoyment of the Lord will be very refreshing and very new
Even if only fifteen of the fifty offer something fresh of Christ, that meeting will be a very refreshing dinner
It is this kind of meeting that cherishes and nourishes people for them to be raised as members of the Body of Christ
For half a year or for one year the leading ones should minister in the line of the scriptural way again and again all the time
Gradually through the help of the leading ones' ministry, one by one the saints will begin to realize that the old way is not that good
The Body is built up directly 'through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part'
Every joint of the supply refers to the specially gifted persons, and each one part refers to every member of the Body
As long as you are one part among the many parts of the Body of Christ, you also have a measure of ability, a measure of function
Regardless of how good a message is given by the speaker in the old way of meeting, there cannot be much growth in life for building up
The old way of meeting does not work in the way to render some particular help in life to each one part of the Body for its building up
The contents of our meetings according to the God-ordained way must always be according to the teaching of the apostles
In the approximately six thousand years of human history, human society has invented many cultural and philosophical things
If there are one thousand members and everyone speaks, a thousand different ideas and philosophies could come into the church
To have every attendant speaking in all the meetings opens the door wide to any kind of false teaching, false doctrine, or heresy
We have the confidence that whenever saints like this come together they would not speak anything other than what was taught by the apostles
The apostles' teaching is concerning God's eternal economy, or dispensation, and we need to realize what this economy comprises
These things have to enter into your being, and you have to enter into these things in order to make these things one with your being
When you get into these two or three verses, do not forget to get into their accompanying notes in the Recovery Version
Foot washing is in John 13 and head covering is in 1 Corinthians 11, but subordinate things like these are not that crucial
Your teaching, your speaking, should be absolutely governed, limited, ruled, and controlled by the teaching of the apostles
Since 1964 we have received much new light from the Word, and there are many new points that need some hymns to express them
That hymn will help us in speaking, but we have to learn to speak in a living way, in a very refreshing way, and in a very inspiring way
We should not just read the hymns, but speak in a Way to stir up the saints and inspire every attendant of the meeting
That hymn was written with much consideration in the spirit, and it was improved and recomposed again and again
How good it would be if we could speak with the language of such a hymn in the meeting rather than speaking our own word
Even concerning a matter like our dress, we have to give a teaching based upon what is taught in the New Testament
We have no liberty to speak anything in the meeting that crosses over the limiting line of the apostles' teaching
If a so-called Christian revelation is beyond the teaching of the apostles, that revelation is not from God but is heresy
White, the chief leader of the Seventh Day Adventists, fell into error by claiming that she received new revelations from God
Thank the Lord that in the apostles' writings, that is, in the New Testament, there are many adequate exhortations
Christ must be the center the centrality and universality the element the essence the substance and altogether every part of what we speak
We may realize that there are certain aspects in the saints' family life or daily living that are void of Christ and short of Christ
Some Jewish scholars, in their overstudy of the Old Testament, liked to dig out things contained in the genealogies
They say that the believers in the New Testament age should still keep the law and one of the commandments of the law is to keep the Sabbath
The apostles' teaching tells us that the feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are shadows, but the reality, the body, of these shadows is Christ
On two consecutive Sabbath days He purposely broke the Sabbatical regulation, offending the Pharisees to the uttermost
As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the authority and the right, the full position, to establish the Sabbath day
Certainly what we teach that is natural according to our culture or tradition is not according to the teaching of the apostles
We should not teach Chinese, British, French, German, American, Japanese, or Korean things in our church meetings
Even if we teach something in the Old Testament dispensation, this teaching is not according to the teaching of the apostles
We cannot teach things that belong to the old dispensation set up by God because we are now in the new dispensation
What we teach in our Christian meetings according to the God-ordained way should be absolutely within the limit of the apostles' teaching
We have to fully learn the truth concerning Christ and the church so that our meetings will never get outside the teaching of the apostles
These seven ages are the ages of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom
The expression the New Testament economy was not used among us in mainland China nor was it used in our work on the island of Taiwan
In other words, the content of God's New Testament economy is a wonderful Person, and this Person is the Triune God
Note 141 of 2 Corinthians 13:14 in the Recovery Version presents a birds-eye view of the divine Trinity throughout the Holy Scriptures
Colossians 2:9 says that Christ is the embodiment, not only of the Godhead but also of the fullness of the entire Godhead
The Triune God embodied Himself in Christ, and this embodiment was the first step for the completion of Christ
In eternity past, Christ was anointed and appointed by God to be the Christ, the commissioned One, the anointed One, the appointed One
The first item in God's New Testament economy was to have the Triune God embodied in Christ for the incarnation of Christ
In His eternal plan, His eternal economy, one item was needed: human blood was needed to redeem fallen humanity
The blood of these sacrifices could not wash away man's sins, but this Man, Jesus Christ, died on the cross and shed His blood for us
The blood of Jesus, the Son of God, cleanses us from all sin, but the divine Son of God without humanity could not possess blood
The One who accomplished God's commission needed to have the human nature so He could shed His blood for fallen man
Christ is the mystery of God, and the mystery of God as God's very expression has been completed by Christ's being incarnated
Before the New Testament times, it would not have been possible to talk to Abraham or David about the mystery of God
John 1:14 tells us that the Word became flesh, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
As the very God, He became flesh, and after thirty-three and a half years in the flesh, He became a life-giving Spirit
We may also say that the stewardship of grace is the economy of grace to carry out God's New Testament economy
Not only did the Apostle Paul receive such an assignment, but also all of us as members of the church have received the same assignment
Whenever we as the attendants in a meeting dispense the processed Triune God into others, actually our meeting dispenses
The Lord has not recovered this meeting life to such a standard in the nearly two thousand years of church history
The economy of God has become our stewardship, and our stewardship is to carry out God's economy in a corporate way by meeting
The mystery of God is Christ , the mystery of Christ is the church , and the great mystery is Christ and the church
We carry out our stewardship by laboring and struggling according to Christ's operation, which operates in us in power
The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the riches of Christ; this ministry ministers the riches of Christ
The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the Spirit, which is versus the ministry of death in the Old Testament
In 2 Corinthians 3, the Spirit is in contrast to death because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and life is versus death
The ministry of the New Testament is also the ministry of righteousness, which is versus the ministry of condemnation
Romans 5:18 says that we have justification of life, that is, we are justified to receive the Spirit which is the very divine life
The riches of Christ are the riches of God, but because the riches of God today are in Christ, they are called the riches of Christ
All the riches ministered to us are for the Body of Christ, and the riches of Christ are the source and the elements of the Body of Christ
The church as the Body of Christ functions in a way to produce new and more members of the Body for the increase of the Body
The church meeting is to dispense the Triune God, and the very processed Triune God in reality is all the riches of Christ
When we minister the riches of Christ to God's chosen people in the meeting, we minister, or dispense, the very Triune God to them
We do not come together merely to serve God or receive grace or salvation; our meeting should issue in one thing-the Body of Christ
The church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, comes out of the dispensing of the riches of Christ
When you speak, you minister, and when you minister, you dispense the processed Triune God, who is all the riches of Christ
It was God and man becoming one in one life and living, while possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively
When you receive Christ as your life, you receive this item of the riches of Christ; you receive a man in perfect humanity
He lived the human life thoroughly on the earth, and this human living is also an item of the riches of Christ
It deals with sin the old man the old creation Satanthe Devil the satanic world and the separating ordinances among different peoples
It will bring us glory; Philippians 3:21 says that our body of humiliation will be transfigured into a glorious body at Christ's coming
The kingdom, in which we will enjoy Christ's kingship and Christ's priesthood for a thousand years is also an item of the riches of Christ
The divine attributes and human virtues of Christ are a great aggregate of Christ's riches, including a multitude of items
Eventually, through our experiences of the riches of Christ, these riches will become an exhibition, a show, of the produce of Christ
Whene'er we meet with Christ endued, The surplus of His plenitude We offer unto God as food, And thus exhibit Christ
In the previous chapters of this book we have seen much concerning the riches of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God
Many Christians attend church services, but few know the relationship between the enjoyment of Christ and the Christian meetings
One day in Los Angeles in 1964, several of the leading ones came together to draft a statement which described the purpose of our meetings
Some Christian groups may speak about and stress that Jesus is the bread of life, but very few have told people to eat Christ
In John 6:48 the Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life, and in John 6:57 He said, 'He who eats Me shall also live because of Me'
If the tree of life were tall like a pine tree and its fruit were at the top, its fruit would be too high for us to reach without difficulty
For eternity, we are destined to eat Christ as the tree of life, which is the fullest expression of Jesus Christ
One night in a prayer meeting of the church in Los Angeles, the saints pray-read all six chapters of the book of Ephesians
The way to have this kind of meeting is to come with our rich enjoyment of the riches of Christ and to speak this enjoyment
They testified that the church life was what they were searching for; formerly they had been hungry, and now they were full
There was something in the meetings which was good for food; it was something which fit their inner taste, making them happy
When we study the Bible with our mind alone, the unsearchable riches of Christ are just words printed in black and white
When we speak the word to others it becomes the word again and when others receive the word that we speak it becomes the Spirit within them
Let them sit, listen, and watch as you and the others with you pray-read in a living, refreshing, strengthening, and energizing way
We receive Him as the life supply by eating, and we eat by exercising our spirit through the word by pray-reading
The enjoyment of Christ for the church meetings includes eating Christ as the tree of life in the paradise of God
The paradise of God refers to the New Jerusalem which will be enjoyed as a foretaste by the overcomers in the coming millennial kingdom
We have the Lord Jesus in the church life today as the tree of life, and in a very positive sense, the church life is a paradise
The manna, which came as the daily food supply for the children of Israel, was a type of the Lord Jesus as our daily food
In Revelation 2:17 the Lord Jesus promised to give the overcomers in the church in Pergamos, the worldly church, to eat of the hidden manna
If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom
The teaching of the Nicolaitans is the teaching of hierarchy, which creates two distinct classes-the clergy and the laity
As we eat Jesus in a hidden way, He becomes our energy of life within to overcome the deeds and teaching of the Nicolaitans
Revelation 2:17 says, 'I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it'
The 'eyesalve' needed to 'anoint' their eyes refers to the anointing Spirit , who is the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit
The enjoyment of Christ as a feast will cause us to gain the faith in Christ, the white garments, and the eyesalve
The processed Triune God is a new expression that we use to describe or unveil what we have seen and what we have experienced of our God
The doctrine of the Trinity has been a matter of great debate among Christian teachers since the second century
The columns of the building are actually steel pillars covered with stone and wood, and these pillars support long steel beams
From eternity according to His revelation, God had the intention, the desire, and even the good pleasure to be enjoyed by His chosen people
We may say that They are three distinct persons, but They are distinct to a certain point and then They are one
The sealing of a piece of paper is not only an action, because the seal itself gets onto the paper, and is even dispensed into the paper
In the action of sealing, the seal comes to the paper, stays on the paper, and becomes one with the paper to be a part of the paper
In the sealing, the seal mingles itself with the paper because the seal penetrates into the very essence of the paper
As the pledge, or the foretaste, of what we shall inherit of God in full, the Spirit was pledged into our being
The Spirit is an all-inclusive Person, including the Father and the Son, and this one Person, the divine Three, becomes the seal
He penetrates into us to become our very intrinsic element and essence; He remains in us even to become us, our very being
Just as sealed paper cannot be separated from the seal, we cannot be separated from the processed, sealing Triune God
He entered into the womb of a human virgin and remained there for nine months to fulfill the principle in His creation
As the Passover Lamb, He was 'roasted with fire' on the cross and burned with the divine fire of God's judgment
In His process the Triune God became a 'fattened calf,' and He was killed on the cross so that we might feed on Him
If we do not call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we will not have the deep sensation that the Spirit is within us
When we call on the Lord Jesus, the Spirit comes, and we have the sensation that the Father is here who loves us so much
Some may not have much assurance that the processed Triune God is within them, and they may not know how to touch Him
In this kind of atmosphere or situation, everyone will speak something, and the meeting will be a feast full of the Triune God
Such a meeting will feed people, and this feeding will issue in the building up of the Body of Christ, the enlargement of the Body of Christ
We should be able to testify to the angels, the demons, the Christians, and the entire universe that we know what the new way is
The Triune God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized in and as the Spirit, and the Spirit is embodied in the living word of Christ
The processed Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, and the Spirit are invisible, but the Word is visible and can be pray-read by us
Our God is pray-readable, Christ is pray-readable, and the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit is pray-readable
Sometimes we may not need a Bible to enjoy the living word because we can pray-read some verses we have memorized
When we pray-read the Word, we are actually pray-reading the processed Triune God with all His unsearchable riches
They indicated that a number of requirements had to be fulfilled for us to reach a point where we were qualified to receive these miracles
We must know what the miraculous normality is to be adequately qualified to carry out God's New Testament economy
Some inner life teachers said that it was not so easy to be regenerated, and they called regeneration the 'first blessing'
To be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit , thus obtaining God's divine life to become the sons of God
It is like taking a picture with a camera; at the appropriate time a 'click' captures all the scenery onto the film
After we began to preach the gospel by visiting people, some wondered how people could be regenerated within fifteen minutes
We instructed the full-time trainees in Taipei to use the booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life in their preaching of the gospel
We can lead this one to the water of baptism, and when we are baptizing him, we can pray, 'Lord, we baptize this one into the Triune God'
Some inner-life teachers said that after being regenerated, a person had to receive what they called 'the fullness of the Spirit'
To drink of the water is something related to the inner life, whereas to be clothed is related to our outward work in our duty or position
The essential aspect of the Spirit is for our life and living and the economical aspect of the Spirit is for our ministry and work
It is difficult to determine when Peter and the other disciples who followed the Lord in His earthly ministry were regenerated
Still others say that Peter was not regenerated until the day of the Lord's resurrection when the Lord breathed the Spirit into him
Another school maintains that Peter was regenerated on the day of Pentecost when the Spirit came upon him, and he stood up to speak
Peter's regeneration began at the time of his calling on the name of the Lord and was completed on the day of the Lord's resurrection
We did not need to call on the name of the Lord and wait three and a half years for our regeneration to be completed
Soon after Peter's regeneration was completed on the day of the Lord's resurrection, he was tested concerning the need of his living
Peter and his colleagues were full-timers who had been called by the Lord to give up their occupations and follow Him
Do you believe that while Peter and the others were fishing the entire night that they were filled inwardly with the Spirit?
If they had prayed in such a way, they surely would have been filled inwardly with the Spirit and would not have gone fishing
There was a great difference with these same disciples when they were in the upper room in Jerusalem as part of the one hundred and twenty
Although the Jewish leaders were persecuting the followers of Jesus, they stayed together to pray for ten days in one accord
Surely all of the one hundred and twenty were completely filled with the Spirit inwardly during those ten days
After the ten days were completed, the Spirit in the economical sense came down from the throne of the ascended Christ to descend upon them
If a policeman attempted to direct traffic or do any of his work without his uniform, he would not command the respect of the people
The uniform of the policeman signifies the authority, power, position, duty, and responsibility of the policeman
Sanctification, transformation, renewing, conformation, and glorification are included in the inner filling of the Spirit
Regeneration, the infilling of the Spirit, and the outpouring of the Spirit, though miraculous, are very normal
Regeneration is a great miracle because a devilish man becomes a divine man, that is, a son of the Devil immediately becomes a son of God
We need to make a thorough confession of all our failures, defects, shortcomings, mistakes, and sinfulness to be filled with the Spirit
Even something small between a husband and wife is good enough to frustrate them from being filled with the Spirit
Standing on what the Bible says, we can claim the infilling of the Spirit by exercising our God-allotted faith
When someone comes to open the door and face you, you will surely have something from the Spirit to say to him
We can exercise our God-allotted faith to believe that we have received the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit
When we are filled inwardly and outwardly with the Spirit, we have the assurance that we are not speaking with our words but with Christ
It is not necessary for us to fast for three days to experience the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit
The two aspects of the filling of the Spirit have been a perplexing and troubling matter among Christians for many years
We need to be clear about the difference between the infilling of the essential Spirit and the outpouring of the economical Spirit
At the age of thirty when He came out to accomplish His ministry, He was baptized, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him as a dove
The Triune God has been consummated to be the one unique Spirit, and with this Spirit are the essential and the economical aspects
Acts 13:52 tells us that when the disciples were filled with the Spirit essentially, they were filled with joy
Speaking the word of praise, of teaching, and of exhortation is also the result and manifestation of the infilling of the Spirit
In the one who is filled with the Spirit inwardly, this revelation becomes an utterance, which is the word of wisdom
It is unfortunate that many readers of these chapters have never considered that they are concerning Christ and the church
If we get into the depths of chapters twelve through fourteen, we will see that they deal with the things concerning Christ and the church
We may receive a word through the inspiration of the infilling Spirit to speak Christ or to speak forth Christ
In 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 the word prophecy refers not mainly to prediction but to speaking Christ and speaking forth Christ
The result and manifestation of the infilling Spirit includes living by the Spirit and walking according to the spirit
We must walk daily and regularly for our living family housing and transportation and we must also walk with a certain direction day by day
In Galatians 5 there are nine items listed including love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faithfulness meekness and selfcontrol
Speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing sickness, and doing miracles are clear evidences of the outpouring of the Spirit
As we have seen, prophesying in the sense of speaking Christ and speaking forth Christ is related to the inward filling of the Spirit
The infilling and the outpouring are also normal to us because our God, who has gone through all the processes, has done everything for us
Because the descending Spirit is now resting upon the Body of Christ and we are a part of the Body, we are under this resting Spirit
We know with full assurance that the resting Spirit is upon us, and we go out to preach the gospel with this reality
We can be regenerated, filled within with the Spirit, and apply the outpoured Spirit so normally because all things have been done for us
In order to reach us, He has passed through many processes so that He could be ultimately consummated as the Spirit
The Spirit is the consummation and completion of the Son and of the Father, that is, the consummation of the Triune God
Our God has been completed, consummated, and this consummating work results in a Person, the all-inclusive Spirit
We consist of three parts: the outermost part, the body; the middle part, the soul; and the inner part, the human spirit
When demons come to possess man, they always come upon his body, but when God comes to us, He comes into our spirit
On God's side, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and on our side, our human spirit is the very center of our being
Initially, God does not come into our body or our soul but into our very center, our spirit, the most intrinsic part of our entire person
If you do not know how to differentiate between the human spirit and the soul, you cannot have the proper spiritual experiences
To have the proper spiritual experiences requires that we realize that we have a human spirit in which the Spirit dwells
John 3:6, John 4:24, and Romans 8:16 are three crucial verses in the New Testament which refer to the two spirits
The Spirit regenerates our spirit, our spirit worships the Spirit, and the Spirit is now working together with our spirit
Later, Watchman Nee published The Spiritual Man, in which he also differentiated between our human spirit and our soul
Without a proper knowledge of our human spirit, we could never have the adequate experiences of Christ as our life
Timothy 1:7 says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind'
All family, social, and national problems are due to the fact that people use their mind, emotion, and will but not their spirit
From the time of our repentance, we the regenerated people should walk, live, and have our being absolutely according to this spirit
We should exercise the spirit given to us by God in prayer , in speaking , in daily walk , and in function in the meetings
The development of the exercise of our spirit is practiced mainly in the proper church life that is based upon the Bible
How wonderful it is that when we exercise our spirit, the processed Triune God works, operates, and even says, 'Amen' within our spirit
If we all experience this our meetings will be in the third heavens full of the Triune God full of Christ and full of the riches of Christ
It is preferable to exercise the spirit and make mistakes, rather than to make no mistakes but be full of the exercise of the mind
You do not come to this ministry to listen to a top lecturer; you come to listen to a brother who is speaking Christ to help you
As long as your spirit is touched nourished edified strengthened and built up with Christ you will be happy and not care about the mistakes
After one of his gospel meetings in which many people were saved, a man came to him and told him that his grammar had been incorrect
If your spouse looks at you with an unpleasant expression and you exercise your mind, you will be angry with her
The more you think in this way, the more the demonic emotion rises up, and eventually the troubling will rises up also
The only way to overcome the devilish mind, demonic emotion, and troubling will is to always call, 'O Lord Jesus'
The way to control them is to call, 'O Lord Jesus,' to speak Christ in the spirit, and to say something about God by exercising your spirit
If you do not do this, while you are sitting in the meeting listening to the testimonies or message, you may criticize everyone
For us to meet and to serve in the scriptural way, we must exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit
The publications that we print are also a shining to spread the explanation and the definition of the invisible God
In Matthew 13, there is a parable of a woman who took leaven and mixed it with the fine flour to leaven its entire contents
Leavened bread is much easier to eat than unleavened bread, but leaven in the Scriptures is a corrupting and evil element
Our publications have touched the hungry hearts there and are shining to spread the word as the embodiment of the Triune God
John 1:14 tells us that the Word, which is the embodiment of the Triune God, became flesh, and this Word become flesh is Jesus, a man
When we preach the word, define the word, and explain the word, what we speak is not merely the word but a Person
When you believe in the gospel, immediately a living Person, Jesus Christ, enters into you, and this Person, Jesus Christ, is the Spirit
When we exercise our spirit to speak the word, we speak God, we speak Christ, we speak the Triune God consummated as the Spirit
Whenever we contact any part of the Bible with our spirit, that part of the Bible becomes spirit and life to us
God is the Word, the Word became flesh, and this Word today is the Spirit, so we all have to exercise our spirit
The more we speak the living word in a living way, the more we exercise our spirit and the more we breathe the fresh air of the Spirit
If speaking the word becomes our habit, we will speak in the meetings and the meetings will be greatly enriched
You will grow by speaking the living word, which is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and you will enjoy what you speak
If you are with another person for only ten minutes without speaking a word, you must be a very strong-willed person
Once we were saved by the Lord, we may have felt that it was very difficult to speak the word of the Lord to others
If we want to speak the word, we must exercise to live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit, to do things according to the Spirit
When we turn away from the lust that desires to talk in a vain way and turn to our spirit, our spirit will direct us to prayer
When the sisters are cooking and no one is with them, they can talk to the oven about the processed Triune God
If you want someone to accompany you when you go somewhere, get the right person to whom you can speak God's word
If we do not speak properly during the day, when we come to the meetings in the evening, we will be the wrong persons
If we have been talking in a worldly way all day long and we come to the meeting in the evening, it is hard to make a 'U-turn'
If our tongue is used to speaking worldly things for six days on the Lords Day our tongue will not cooperate with us to speak the holy word
If we speak verses such as these again and again, this will help us build up a strong habit of speaking the word
After nearly two thousand years of church history, the Lord cannot see a builded church as His living Body on the earth today
Whenever these living members come together, they do not necessarily need to choose a subject on which to speak
If they all speak there will be something of the Lord in every speaking and all the attendants will receive the benefit and will be built up
Whether or not the scriptural meeting which we desire to have is prevailing in the coming days depends upon our speaking
At this point, however, a local church may find it hard to attract more people and the yearly percentage of increase may become quite low
To speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs is to apply certain verses from the Bible to your affairs
If you are intending to go to a department store to spend some money, it is best to get a verse that fits that situation
When you are looking at some merchandise and are about to make a purchase, you can speak Romans 12:2-'Do not be conformed to this age'
When you shine your shoes, a verse like Ephesians 5:15 will help you-'Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise'
If a sister is cooking fish, she can get some verses from John 21 where the Lord cooked fish for the disciples' breakfast
A person who has the riches of God's word in his being can speak something rich, inspiring, and subduing in the meetings
The One who lives in you is the King of kings, and He is much higher than all the presidents, kings, and queens on this earth
We let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts, and then we let the word of Christ occupy us and take us over
We may have the intention and the desire to speak, but we have to stop our speaking because we do not have the storage of utterances
We can always keep our utterance rich by letting the word of Christ make its home in us, occupy us, and take us over
If we love the Lord and mean business with the Lord for His recovery, we must be so faithful and honest to practice all these items
In chapter sixteen, we saw that we need to be those who exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit
Because we do not adequately practice speaking the Lord's word, we do not have the habit of teaching others to do so
Hebrews 5:13 says, 'For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe'
The book of Hebrews also mentions 'the good word of God' , which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord
The more we increase not only our knowledge but also our experience of the word, the more we will be equipped to perfect others
When we go to take care of the new ones in the home meetings, we will have the rich materials in our being to use
The many different kinds of people who are saved by the Lord through our gospel preaching will need help to begin their home meetings
We all have to gain an increase and an accumulation of the knowledge and experience of the word based on the Scriptures
To endeavor to practice the meeting that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 is a heavy burden
If we get into one of these hymns, we will be able to understand the portion of the Word concerning which it was written
Some of the young people did this and finished reading all the messages and also all the footnotes of the Recovery Version
The Lord may afford some among us, especially the young people, the opportunity to study the New Testament in the same way
We can gain the knowledge and experience of the Lord's word based on the Scriptures, through the hymns, and through the publications in life
To teach differently is to teach things different from the healthy words of the Lord Jesus and from the teaching of the apostles
To pick up a practice such as foot washing and not be restricted within the limits of the teaching of the apostles is altogether not healthy
We were the first Christians who practiced head covering in mainland China, but we did not practice it in a legal way
When we go out to preach the gospel and people get saved and baptized, we should immediately begin to help them have home meetings
We spent much time in our full-time training in Taipei on this matter, and we are still learning and improving our practice
We learned that from now on we have to apportion our labor according to our manpower and the time that we have
In principle then, this church should not go out to get more than two hundred new ones to receive the Lord and be baptized
In our preaching of the gospel, we also practiced to lead a person to believe and be baptized within fifteen minutes
According to our experience, the best time to help the new ones know some basic things is immediately after they have been baptized
We should give them at least two verses to show them that their salvation is by regeneration through the Holy Spirit in their human spirit
After covering the matter of praying and reading the Bible, we have to help the new ones follow their inner sense
You may illustrate to a new one that before he was saved, he may have gotten angry with someone, maybe with one of his neighbors
Based on this fact, you can point out to him that he has a sensation, a feeling, a consciousness, that he did not have before he was saved
Immediately after their baptism have them start calling on the name of the Lord and encourage them to call all day long
You can then build upon this foundation and help them with many other things such as the clearance of their past and their old living
You must be a praying person, giving the new ones an impression that you bear a spirit, an attitude, and an atmosphere of prayer
There are many ways to lead the new believers into calling on the name of the Lord; the way largely depends upon your practice
As little children like to follow their parents, the new believers will follow you to copy and imitate whatever you practice
In order to help the new ones to do anything, we need to read and study the proper verses in the Old and New Testaments
Throughout the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New Testament, there is the line of such a life of calling on the name of the Lord
We must learn to practice calling upon the name of the Lord all the time-spontaneously, instantly, and constantly
Calling on the Lord is a unique way to touch the Lord, to contact the Lord, and to enter into the full enjoyment of His unsearchable riches
From the first time we contact the new believers, we should lead them into the practice of calling upon the name of the Lord
While we are listening to a message or engaged in any other kind of activity, we can call on the name of the Lord within
We should not hold the concept that when we call on the Lord, He is present, and that when we do not call on the Lord, He is absent
Regardless of the situation, whether we call or not, whether we are up or down, whether we do well or not, He is always with us
When you call, you have the sensation of His presence; when you do not call, you have the sensation of His absence
We must tell the new ones that today the Lord is the lifegiving Spirit and that as such a Spirit He is our Redeemer Savior Lord and Master
If we would go to bed at night saying, 'Lord Jesus,' the next morning we may say, 'O Lord Jesus,' spontaneously
If we make up our mind not to lose our temper Satan sends in one thing after another to urge charge induce and stir us up to lose our temper
If we do not make up our mind to restrain our temper, we are able to restrain it in the Lord without hindrance from Satan
When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus
After leading the new ones to call on the name of the Lord, we should immediately lead them to be filled with the essential Spirit
After calling on the Lord and making a thorough confession, some thought that they should immediately have joy
We must exercise our spirit to speak, confess, and call, and we must exercise our faith to stand on the Lord's word
He expected something from the heavens to come down upon him, but nothing happened that day, so he was very disappointed
He had prayed, confessed, and asked the Lord to forgive him, but according to his feeling nothing had happened
We too must learn as we are being filled with the Spirit, to leave the manifestation of our being filled with the Spirit to the Lord
We must tell them that as new believers they should give testimonies to their family, relatives, neighbors, and friends
If we are such people ourselves, we will then be able to bring this kind of atmosphere, attitude, and spirit to them
Spontaneously and sometimes even unconsciously, we will lead them into the realization and enjoyment of this outpoured Spirit
On the one hand, these things are miraculous to the uttermost; but on the other hand, they are so normal in our experience
They were regenerated, filled with the Spirit within, and experienced the outpouring of the Spirit all at the same time
We should not think that it is too early for one who has just been baptized to experience the outpouring of the Spirit
Some who were saved long ago were seeking the outpouring of the Spirit for many years, but their seeking was with much unbelief
Once they develop a taste for this kind of meeting, they will not want to practice the new way ordained by the Lord
Once they get used to attending this kind of meeting, they lose their appetite and taste for taking the biblical way
In Christianity today there is a great facade which attracts people and keeps them under the apparent edification of teaching
On the whole earth today, no group has fully entered into the practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25
We are burdened for the recovery of the practice of these two verses so that the Lord can have the practical building up of His Body
We should lead the new ones to know that one should speak for the Lord and speak the Lord immediately after being saved
If a so-called layman, such as a bank manager who just became a Christian, were to tell his neighbor, 'Jesus is good
We have to lead the new ones into the realization that they need to learn the word so that they can speak the word in the meetings
They learn the word of the Lord in order to speak the word in their home meeting, which is one of many kinds of believers' meetings
Following our example, they can speak by the word of the Scriptures, by the hymns, and by the publications in life
The new ones should realize that our meetings are also for the believers to listen to others speak the word of the Lord
If there is a church in our locality already, we should submit ourselves to the church and go along with the church
Brother Watchman Nee was the one who brought the revelation concerning the Lord's recovery to us in China about sixty-two years ago
He said that if we remove our old way of having the Lord's Day morning message meeting, we will not have anything to replace it
If we did not replace it, this would create a gap in the practical church life into which negative things could come
He said that the old system of meeting with one speaker and the rest listening was according to the customs of the nations
At the beginning of the Lord's recovery outside of mainland China in the East and in the West, the churches were not like this
Today we are attempting to change from a traditional way which has existed on this earth for nearly nineteen centuries
To accomplish such a goal we need the way to save sinners, to make sinners sons of God so they can be brought into the church
Otherwise, we will not have the new materials to accomplish such a great universal building, the building up of the Body of Christ
From 1962 to 1984 in the United States we concentrated our ministry on Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church
To get thirty-eight thousand people to receive the Lord and be baptized required a lot of labor, yet this was accomplished
After His resurrection, He charged all of His disciples to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God
The early missionaries opened up the old and conservative China because they paid the price to visit people with the gospel
They did not have the light that we do, but in this matter of living to God's gospel, these devoted God-men were incomparable
In the subjective aspect of the practice of the scriptural way, we stress the preaching of the gospel by visiting people
We have to go to visit people to bring God, Christ, the Spirit, the gospel, the holy Word, salvation, and God's presence to them
When it comes to preaching the gospel, visiting people by knocking on their doors is higher and better than any other way
Rather, we can take the best way to preach the gospel by visiting people, knocking on their doors to find the sons of peace
Acts 2 tells that at the beginning of the church life, the three thousand who were baptized began immediately to meet in their homes
The Greek text for Acts 2:46 indicates that they met not merely from house to house but according to their homes
The third factor in the subjective aspect of practice is that we meet by speaking and listening to one another in mutuality
We also have to learn how to build up home meetings and group meetings with the intention to build up a proper church life
We all need to labor gradually and positively in this way to reach God's goal-the building up of the Body of Christ
Out of one thousand, two hundred fifty may go out, and the other seven hundred fifty may remain home to pray for them and support them
The building up of the local church does not depend on the big meetings; it depends upon the home meetings of the saints
Some may feel that we are helping the saints to preach the gospel by a technique rather than by the power of the Holy Spirit
They may question whether we believe that it is the technique or the power of the Holy Spirit which can save people
The electricity is so available in your home because you hired the electrician with the proper skill and technique to install the wires
To read The Mystery of Human Life and present the keys in it is the best way to install the 'wires' and 'switches'
We must help the attendants to speak and to listen in a living way, not by exercising their mind, but by exercising their spirit
We must build in the way that is so living and so much in the riches of Christ, the way according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25
We could build a hall or a chapel or rent a large room, hire a good speaker, and send out advertisements and invitations
Some heavenly light has come to shine over and within us, and something of this light remains in our inner being
Do not consider that because you have seen these matters, you have a special knowledge that the saints in your church do not have
Even if some dear ones are opposed to the door-knocking, none of them would say anything to frustrate gospel preaching
In Taipei, even though certain new ones came to the big meetings, they had no taste for the old way because of the foundation laid with them
Do not stand in the meetings of the church to tell the saints that their practice is not right or up to the proper standard
Expressing your idea or opinion, despising others, and criticizing or even uplifting a church will not help others
Only the exercise of your spirit with faith, wisdom, and grace can nourish and cherish people and even bring them into God's economy
After five or ten minutes according to the Spirit's leading, you may ask the brother to pray-read two or three verses with you
The outward expressions of the inner essence, substance, and nature of a certain thing are its characteristics
After you go to the meeting and return home, your spouse may tell you that you are a different person, that you are living, new, and fresh
These are expressions of the inward, intrinsic essence and nature which you received from attending such a meeting
Whether or not a meeting is according to God's ordained way depends upon whether or not it makes people living
Sometimes we may have a meeting that is like a cemetery with all the attendants sitting there so calm and so dead
We need to have a proper noise in our meetings where everyone speaks, everyone prays, everyone praises, and everyone gives thanks
Many who have attended the so-called services in Christianity week after week have had their ability and function annulled
By birth a small child has all its organs-organs for eating, digesting, seeing, listening, smelling, speaking, and walking
Suppose a child's parents practiced a way that prevented the child from having any kind of movement or function for twenty years
For the long run, all the seeking ones will grow tired of listening to the same kind of messages year after year
Certain co-workers and elders have been assigned in the past to take care of giving a message in the Lord's Day message meeting
The new way releases the brothers from this kind of suffering and releases the saints to develop their organic ability and function
If you put a piece of candy into their mouths and tell them it is not good for them, they will still eat it because of the sweet taste
According to their thinking tradition education and knowledge they had a critical opinion and view but within their spirit there was a taste
Another expression that we must bear is that the ultimate goal in our church meetings is the building up of the Body of Christ
Whatever we do must issue in the building up of the Body of Christ, not merely in the building up of the local church in our locality
When people go to another country and learn another language, it is hard for them to get rid of their native accent
Those of us from countries outside the United States may all speak English, but we speak it with different accents
Such a local accent is strong proof that the church does not meet absolutely for the building up of the Body of Christ
If we are simply local, we become a local sect, a local division, not the local expression of the universal Body of Christ
We must remember that the meeting we desire to practice is one that really builds up the universal Body of Christ
We have to practice our gospel visitation in a way that is full of respect and that is according to some absolute requirements
If we want to go out to preach the gospel by visiting people through knocking on doors, we must be one with Christ
In 2 Corinthians 12:2 Paul told us that he was a man in Christ, and in Philippians 3:9 he aspired to be found in Christ
In other words, he wanted to be one with Christ that people might see him in Christ, find him in Christ, and meet him in Christ
As long as we are persons in Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God, we are qualified to visit people for gospel preaching
To be persons who are always one with Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God, we need to live Christ in our daily life
If we live Him, we will spontaneously represent Him and have the proper gravity that will cause people to regard and respect us
The disciples with the apostles in Jerusalem, being under the persecution and threat of the Jewish leaders, prayed together
As they were praying, they were all filled with the Spirit outwardly, once more experiencing the outpoured Spirit
As a result, they had the boldness to speak the word of God and even to testify to the very Jewish leaders who were persecuting them
In 1 Timothy 2, Paul exhorts us to pray on behalf of all men because God our Savior desires all men to be saved
In Romans 10:1, Paul said concerning the Jews, 'The delight of my heart and my supplication to God for them is for their salvation'
Like Paul, the delight of our heart needs to be the salvation of men because this is the delight of God's heart
We need to pray to the Lord that His concern for sinners' salvation would be dispensed into us to become our burden
In our gospel visitation, we must contact and convince people with the goal of Christ being imparted into them
If you repeat the same opening word again and again in a mechanical way, you are like an actor and your visitation is a performance
They will be so willing to open up themselves to you and to talk with you so that you can impart Christ into them
The Spirit goes with us when we visit people for the gospel, He contacts people with us, and He enters into the homes with us
If a candidate could not pass this interview, he would have to be comforted and encouraged so that he would not be disappointed
The one who brought him to the Lord might tell him, 'I will help you learn more from the Bible about salvation to prepare you
The church will probably have another baptism in three weeks and that will not be too late for you to come back
According to the New Testament, however, there is not one instance where a believer is asked to wait for a time before he can be baptized
Brother Nee was burdened that this young man be baptized before leaving China, so he referred this case to another co-worker
Brother Nee told the co-worker that this young man was going to America to study, so there was no time to wait
Today's Christianity, in general, does not practice baptizing people immediately after they believe, but we must take the biblical way
The Philippian jailer and his entire household were baptized by Paul and Silas immediately after they believed in the Lord Jesus
Under the Lord's sovereignty, there were homes in the ancient times that had such bathing facilities that could also be used as a baptistry
Finally, you must not take this kind of gospel visitation as an easy matter, and you must avoid any kind of lightness
While we are knocking on people's doors for the preaching of the gospel, we also have to endeavor to have proper meetings
For the one grain to be multiplied into many grains, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of that one grain into many grains
In the same principle, for the vine tree to be multiplied, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of the tree into the fruit
The vine tree is the organism of the Triune God with the divine life for the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity
The organism of the Triune God, which is His very embodiment, Christ Himself, functions to contain the Triune God
Fruit-bearing is the multiplication and the enlargement of this divine tree, the divine organism of the processed Triune God
The branches of the true vine are for fruit-bearing , and the purpose of the Lord's choosing of the branches is for fruit-bearing
The branches of the vine bear fruit for the glorification of the Father-for the multiplication of the Father in the Son
When it dies in the earth, grows up, and bears many grains, these many grains are the one grain's glory, the glorification of the one grain
After His resurrection and through His propagation, we are here as His glorification, which is His multiplication
Christ is glorified in His multiplication, and we together with all the believers on this earth are His multiplication
God the Father prunes us by showing us all our defects, failures, and wrongdoings, that we may make a thorough confession to Him
Through this thorough confession, we are cleansed from our defects, imperfections, defeats, failures, wrongdoings, mistakes, and sinfulness
Whenever we make a thorough confession, we have the sensation that we are so clean and cleared up from many negative things
Suppose that you, as a branch of Christ, go out to visit people without having a thorough confession, without the pruning
As branches, when we are pruned, we are washed and cleansed through our confession according to God's exposing
The Lord says clearly that if we are branches not bearing fruit, we are in danger of being cut off from the vine tree
The pathway for fruitbearing is to abide in the vine that is to remain in the very organic union with Christ receiving the Fathers pruning
We have to renew this speaking in us every day by picking up two verses early in the morning to enjoy the Lord
In the universe, the Son of the Trinity is the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is the expression of the Triune God
Life is for the reproduction, for the multiplication, for the glorification, for the expression of the source of life, the Father
According to the Bible, history, and our own experiences, the best way to preach the gospel is to visit people
They were instructed to enter into people's homes and stay with them to find out whether or not they were sons of peace
The best way to bear fruit is to knock on people's doors, and the best way for the fruit to remain is to have home meetings
We were once more under God's shining, and by His mercy and grace, we cooperated with this divine shining by confessing
God was merciful to us by shining over us and touching us to make a thorough confession, and the addition of God into our being began again
Through this ongoing addition, many of us can testify that we have much more of God today than we had when we were first saved
The Body of Christ is the fullness, the expression, of all that Christ is, the fullness of all the riches of Christ
Our fruit-bearing is for the expression of the Triune God, and this expression is the Body of Christ, which is the church
The more that God is added into us, the more growth we will have; and the more growth we have, the more fruit we will bear
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
We need to understand the relationship of these four nouns in 4:13-the measure, the stature, the fullness, and Christ
The fullness of Christ is simply the expression of Christ, and this expression is the very church, which is His Body
Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself in love
The building up of the Body of Christ is mainly carried out in the meetings, through the meetings, and with the meetings
Any meeting that is still according to the old way is below the level for the building up of the Body of Christ
Christianity has brought in millions of believers, but most of them have been annulled in their function and made of no effect
On the one hand, this wrong type of meeting accomplishes something, but on the other hand, it tears down what it builds up
We have not had much increase, and today among the dear saints in the Lord's recovery not many are organically useful
The revelation concerning the Lord's person is the very foundation, the very rock, on which the Lord is building up His church
In Ephesians 2:20-22 the Apostle Paul tells us that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets
The church as the dwelling place of God is built upon the revelation of Christ's divine person that the Father gave Peter
Christ's person is mainly in two aspects, indicated by the titles 'the Christ' and 'the Son of the living God' in Matthew 16:16
His designation as 'the Christ' refers to His work, His ministry, and His commission to accomplish God's eternal purpose
The Son of the living God' refers purely and solely to the person of Christ, to the very essence and substance of Christ
The church as the dwelling place of God is also built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone
The entire church, not just in one place but in the whole universe, is the temple of God, which will be consummated in the New Jerusalem
The entire city of the New Jerusalem will be the temple of God, the consummation of God's dwelling place in this universe
After being regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, our human spirit is now the very dwelling place of God
We may know the term the Body of Christ, but we may not be clear in our understanding concerning the real significance of the Body of Christ
In the picture of the house of God, the house and the Dweller are two; the house is the dwelling place and the dweller is God
God's New Testament economy has accomplished such a marvelous thing-to make all the believers parts of the one Christ
The Head and the Body are Christ, the Body is the church, and all the members of the church are the members of this organic Body
It is difficult to have a thorough understanding of the Body of Christ because this matter is too mysterious, deep, spiritual, and divine
The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is completed through the perfecting work of the gifted persons
These gifted persons are of four categories-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
Although the early apostles and prophets who received the revelation of the New Testament are not here, we are still being perfected by them
Their revelation in their writings especially the writings of the Apostle Paul has done a lot of perfecting work throughout the generations
The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is by the members of the Body growing up into Christ, the Head, in all things
We all need to grow up into Christ in a practical way in all things, such as the way we dress and the way we cut and comb our hair
We may have been saved for three years and gradually during this time we have grown into Christ in a certain matter
Spontaneously he will have a change in his attitude toward his mother and a change in the way he treats his mother
Regardless of how old or experienced in Christ the saints may be, very few of them have grown into Christ in the matter of gossip
In God's sight, whenever we speak something that is not necessary, whether it is good or bad, that is gossiping
An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, having no positive function, useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren
When some saints receive hospitality, they might open all the drawers and closets in the room where they are staying
Once you know something about the saints, you can be sure that you will speak about it to someone sooner or later
When you are put into a room for hospitality, you should only use what you have been directed to use by the host
Learn not to touch anything that you do not have the right to touch and learn not to know anything that you do not have the position to know
To know things about others and to speak them damages you and spreads a killing death, the killing power of the subtle one, in the church
Our mouths must flow out the words of grace, the words concerning Christ that edify and build up others and that mend and heal the wounds
All the Body, out from the Head, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself in love
The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 24:35, 'The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away'
The traditional way to meet and to serve surely cannot fulfill the Lord's words concerning the building up of His church
If 1 Corinthians 1426 and Hebrews 1025 are not fulfilled there is no way for the building up of the house of God and of the Body of Christ
The heaven and the earth will pass away at the time of the Lord's coming back, and His words will be fulfilled
Organization refers to Christianity, including Catholicism and all the denominations, which constitute 'the church'
Many so-called denominational 'churches' build themselves up by preaching the gospel to, as they would say, 'win souls'
Millions of Christians have been helped to receive Christ as their Savior, and some spiritual help has been rendered to them
Out of millions of Christians, only a small percentage are useful; most of these are members of the so-called clergy
When we were in that way, we did not sense this because along with the spiritual help we received, we were unconsciously drugged
Without organization, the churches in the Lord's recovery would still stand because they are not built upon organization
We visit them with Christ as grace, life, forgiveness of sins, and salvation and with all the truths in the Bible
With us Christians, the believers in Christ, it is always possible that we could take something as a truth without the reality
We may go to the church in our locality and say that it is wrong to have a big meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen
The new way of meeting will be different in the form, the practice, the outward way, but in actuality there will be emptiness, not reality
We do have such a reality, and this reality changes not only the outward way of the meeting but also its inward, intrinsic essence
He brought us Himself as our enjoyment in the aspect of grace and as reality to be realized by us in the aspect of truth
If we do not have the Triune God Himself as the reality of our teaching concerning the Trinity, our teaching is just vain and empty theology
He was the very reality of what He spoke to the disciples, of what He brought to them, and of what He intended to give them
He did not intend to give us doctrines; He intended to give us God Himself, and this divine Self is simply the divine Spirit
All that the Triune God is, has gone through, has accomplished, and has attained and obtained is consummated in this consummating Spirit
If you have this Spirit, you have the very humanity of the Lord with His divinity, and you even have His very human living
If you have this Spirit, you have the reality of the resurrection, which is the unique power in the entire universe
If you have this Spirit, you are in the heavens because the ascension of Christ is wrapped up with and one with the Spirit
You are one with this Christ because you have the reality which is the very consummated and consummating Spirit
When you speak, you must have the assurance that you are passing on, that you are dispensing, some amount of this reality to people
Every day we need to have a good start of the day by contacting God to have a renewed revival and to receive enlightenment
Throughout the whole day you must live in this Triune God, and you must live the very embodiment of this Triune God, Christ
In the evening we may go to meet with our dear fellow-believers, either our family in our own home, our neighbors, or our relatives
Do not consider that you are the only one who has been trained, qualified, and equipped with something to supply
If you do have something, you do not need to advertise or promote yourself; you do not need to prove that you have something
Pray, but in your prayer do not have a facade that you have received so much from the fellowship of the training contained in this book
Life will come out of you as a dispensing to support others and to supply them with the riches which you have enjoyed of Christ
We must bear all these riches which will spontaneously become a life supply dispensed into each one whom we contact
Do not go to tell others that you have received so much and that many days would be needed for you to tell them everything
When He speaks, He ministers Himself, He imparts Himself, and He dispenses some elements of His person into His listeners
The Lord Jesus only ministered for about three and a half years, forty-two months, but He imparted and dispensed much
Even though Peter James John and the other disciples did not realize what they were infused with they still received some infusion of Christ
If we would live in the way of infusing others, how good our situation would be after three, five, or ten years!
The life supply is the bountiful supply of the allinclusive lifegiving Spirit making truth real with the essence of the processed Triune God
In the church in your locality, make the very truth which you convey real with the essence of the divine Triune God
Simply live what you are and be what you are in the Lord, bringing nothing but the reality of the processed Triune God to others
We should take every opportunity to minister, to impart, to dispense, and to infuse those around us with something of the Triune God
The application of the biblical way for the believers to meet and to serve should be gradual according to our present situation
When a doctor treats someone, he always proceeds gradually according to the condition of the illness and the real situation of the patient
You need to take the present situation of the church in your locality into a thorough, careful, and fine consideration
You need to consider what the first and second courses should be, what the last course should be, and how long each course should last
We all must learn how to consider the situation of the eaters how they appreciate and receive the courses of the feast and how well they eat
When we turn the cake on one side, we tend to leave it there; that side will be burnt while the other side is raw
During the period of such an endeavoring practice, we should do everything we can to avoid any kind of opinion or dispute
We should not look down on those who seemingly do not practice the new way, nor should we uplift those who do practice the new way
Keep in mind that in practicing the biblical way our goal is to arrive at one of the major items in the Lord's recovery
It seems that we are now very close to the end of this age, the conclusion of the ages, which will bring the Lord back
According to our knowledge of the Bible, it seems that this new way may be the last and concluding recovery of the Lord
The saints and the elders in all the churches must consider what we should do with the Lord's Day morning meeting
We may not need to change the day or the time of our present meetings, but we surely need to change the nature of the meetings
To set up a meeting on this day will be convenient, not only to the Christian believers but also to the Gentiles
My expectation is first that many faithful saints would go out to visit people and that daily hundreds would be saved around the globe
A large church may even have hundreds of these district meetings to represent the meeting of the entire church
