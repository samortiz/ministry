   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S WORD BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's Word is merely theological knowledge to many people; it is not life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the Lord says that His word is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word of God touches our spirit and our life; it does not relate to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It matters little if the mind does not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In reading a book or listening to a sermon, we can tell immediately whether we have touched spirit and life within or whether we have touched the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have heard only knowledge, the result is death, and we feel uneasy within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have heard spirit and life, the result is peace and assurance within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The less mature a Christian is, the more answers he has.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God does not furnish definitive answers in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a sign of hyperactivity of the mind to demand clarity in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All we have to do is to take a passage, a verse, or a few sentences from the Scripture and speak it plainly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We only need to touch spirit and life; we do not need to build up others' intellect or give them much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we touch spirit and life, others will be refreshed, and they will receive the genuine help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was in London, I once sat with some out-of-town visitors during a message by Brother Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Afterwards I asked whether they had received any help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They answered that the teaching was good, but that he had omitted many points.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They only paid attention to theology.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were not there to receive life-nourishment, but mental knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We would rather not touch so many points, but concentrate on one point which renders help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the value of spirit and life: It is sufficient if only one point within a broad subject touches others and meets their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is after a weak person, one who is dependent on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who truly know the cross are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord take away our desire to deliver perfect messages or to write perfect books, and may we not hinder the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May we not exercise the kind of human wisdom and natural eloquence that will induce others' expectation for our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A good message that only reaches others' minds is unprofitable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people are too good at speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, others only see the speaker; they do not see God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They only hear man's words of wisdom; they do not hear the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I used to have my own standard concerning the messages I delivered and the books I wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes I would feel bad after delivering a message on Sunday, because I felt that I came short of my own expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, God does not need to use our entire message, nor all the verses that we quote.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes He only uses one or two words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible says that God's word is life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can ignore man's misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God is not afraid of misunderstanding, why should we be afraid of it?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is responsible for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the flesh tries to have a perfect message.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has no intention of achieving any perfection in the mind; He is only after perfection in spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We often feel discouraged when others do not understand our message.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But actually, the hungry ones receive the help, while those who understand the message do not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word of God is spirit and life; it divides the soul from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man has nothing to give except Bible knowledge, those who listen will find his speaking fruitless and childish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once I was about to meet a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before she came to me I asked the Lord to stop me from using any words of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Words of wisdom can only educate the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I asked the Lord to give me words of light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When she came, I spoke much, but she was still unenlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At a certain point in the conversation, she suddenly became clear and asked me to repeat the sentence that had just helped her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She wanted to remember what I had just said.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told her that I did not know what I had said that had helped her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later, I recalled what I had said and repeated it, and she tried to memorize it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows that the profit derived from God's word has nothing to do with one's memory; it has to do with spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people remember words that others have said, but these words do not render anyone any help.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But many forgotten words are often the source of life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Dividing the word of God does not mean merely breaking it down into sections and subdivisions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It has to do with the dividing of the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is like dividing the bone from the marrow by a sword.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's word often can bypass our mind and go straight into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ did not say that His words are theology, teachings, or answers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We know that many people are anti-theology and anti-teaching, but we are not talking about that here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are saying that the Lord's word is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul told Timothy to cut straight the word of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, only those who are cut by God can cut straight God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In our Bible we have to put Hebrews 4:12 before 2 Timothy 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May the Lord speak to us within and deliver us from doctrines and theology, and may we truly know that God's word is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Prayer: Lord, remove our ambition for gaining knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May we gladly prostrate ourselves in the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May we be delivered out of the superficiality of the Bible and into its depths.</S>
