<p>You don&rsquo;t need to say turn to the Spirit. You just need to stay in the Spirit. In the past we have had a slogan &ldquo;Turn to the Spirit.&rdquo; We should drop this and instead we should say, &ldquo;Stay in your spirit.&rdquo; Stay means that you are already there in the Spirit. You don&rsquo;t need such a long prayer to cause you to stay in your spirit. Even a short prayer will cause you to stay in your spirit. When you start to lose your temper just an &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; will keep you in your spirit. Although I am so busy all the day long, I &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; a lot to remain in the Spirit. When you say, &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; you stay in the Spirit. Our experience tells us that we do have the Spirit and the Spirit does dwell in us. This is not a kind of superstition; this is a divine spiritual fact. We may use the example of breathing. We know there is air because we can breathe it in. And we know that we have a breathing organ because we can breathe in the air. Today the Lord is the Spirit, the <em>pneuma,</em> the air. And we can breathe the Spirit. I like A. B. Simpson&rsquo;s hymn where he speaks of breathing, breathing, breathing. The point is this, dear saints: the Spirit really dwells in us, regardless of whether your weather is cold or hot or stormy or calm. None of these things bothers Him. Whether you are at home or you are in the wrong place, He still dwells in you. This is the fact. You do have Him. You possess Him, and He occupies you. We only possess Him, but He not only possesses but also occupies us. This means that He is here all the time. So in a sense we don&rsquo;t need to turn to Him. We just need to stay in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now we are clear that we have to stay in this Spirit. But what kind of Spirit is the Spirit? Is this the Holy Spirit? Or is this our human spirit? During the past twenty years, I have spoken a lot of messages on the mingled spirit. Some, who are short of knowledge, have condemned our teaching concerning the mingled spirit.</p>
<p>One verse which refers to the mingled spirit is 2 Corinthians 4:13: &ldquo;And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.&rdquo; In translating this verse, many versions of the Bible use a small letter s for the spirit, indicating our spirit. One version, however, uses a capital letter S, indicating the Spirit. This is the Wuest translation. Furthermore M. R. Vincent, in his <em>Word Studies in the New Testament,</em> says concerning this verse: &ldquo;Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty of disposition, but blending both.&rdquo; We all know that blending is a synonym for mingling. So when we speak of staying in the spirit, we mean in the blended spirit, in the mingled spirit. Hallelujah! We have a spirit, and our spirit has been regenerated, and the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit making the two one spirit. This is the spirit in which we have to remain. How can we remain in such a spirit? All the time we have to, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; The best way to keep you in your spirit and to save you from losing your temper is to &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_122.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_124.html">Next</a> </body></html>
