 <h1 class="title">Part III&mdash;Special Topics<br />
<span class="normal">In the following outlines there are eight groups,<br />
each consisting of several topics which are suitable<br />
for special gospel preaching meetings.</span></h1>
<h1 class="series">GROUP 1<br />
MATTERS RELATED TO MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Eleven</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ORIGIN OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 17:24-29<br />
The main purpose of this subject is to prove that God exists.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man&rsquo;s origin is God, because man is created by God</li>
<li>The amazing structure of man&rsquo;s body proves that man is created by God<br />
<span class="normal">In passing, argue against and show the absurdity of the theory of evolution.</span></li>
<li>The chemical composition of the human body proves that man is created by God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Bible says that man is made of dust, and the chemical composition of the human body is the same as dust.</li>
	<li>When you are speaking, mention in detail the function of different members of the human body, how they are utterly marvelous and could never have come about through mere evolution.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Therefore, we must conclude that if there is man, there is God<br />
<span class="normal">If you and I exist, there is God. Man&rsquo;s existence proves that God exists.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twelve</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE NATURE OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Jer. 17:9; Mark 7:21-23; Rom. 7:14, 18; Gen. 8:21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The characteristics of man express the nature of man<br />
<span class="normal">Every object has its own characteristics. Because man is living, his characteristics express his nature. What an object is depends on its characteristics; what man is depends on his nature. In other words, with an inanimate object it is a matter of characteristics, while with a living person it is a matter of nature. If we want to study the subject of man, we cannot avoid studying the nature of man.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s nature, is it good or bad, virtuous or evil?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First, discuss what the sages of both the East and the West have had to say. Some have said that the nature of man is good while others have said it is evil.</li>
	<li>Then, using the Bible, prove that human nature is evil. When speaking of the evil nature of man, you should mention that the nature of man at the time of creation was good (Eccl. 7:29); but later, because sin came in causing man to fall, man&rsquo;s nature became evil. The evil nature came from Satan. Satan defiled and overcame man&rsquo;s good nature. So, we may say that today man&rsquo;s nature is evil. Use the words of the Bible to show this clearly.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Conclusion
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s nature is evil beyond repair.</li>
	<li>Man needs another life with another nature.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
