   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW WORDS FROM CO-WORKER TS'AI CH'I</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to my dear brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mr. Watchman Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have not written to you for a long time because I have been too lazy to write since we parted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I have met with you often before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would like to mention some matters briefly so that we may thank the Lord together!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has raised up faithful children in all the localities of Wenchow and P'ing Yang to truly take up a heavier cross and live a more difficult life for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are a few brothers who once worked in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now they stand alone by relying on the Lord for the sake of obeying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is completely His work, and we thank the Father for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is something in all the localities that causes us to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many brothers and sisters have not really been revived!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have only moved out of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, we have already seen "a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand" arising!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we hope you will pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ts'ai Ch'i</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some brothers who live by faith: P'an Huo Ling, 36 Beneath the Iron Well, Lan Hsing Temple, Wenchow; Lin Sheng Wu, P'u Men Horse Carriage Station.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A LETTER FROM THE JAN BROTHERS IN HANGCHOW REQUESTING TO LEAVE THE DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Greetings to the Directors of the Sze Cheng Chapel:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we have seen that in the Bible there are no denominational differences and that it is a sin to have denominations, please remove our names from the Sze Cheng Chapel's Book of Life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a matter of personal emotions but of obeying the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since we have done this, we do not need to mention it again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we meet, we are still friends.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have no other motives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is all we have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peace in your way!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sincerely,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jan Ch'i Yu, Jan Feng T'ien</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>July 10</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LETTERS FROM CHEN CHIA DISTRICT,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>HUAI AN, NORTHERN KIANGSU One</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Greetings to the faithful bondslaves in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>our dear brothers, Mr. Watchman and Mr. Witness:</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord for His love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Its depth is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even a worthless and evil servant like myself has been graciously called by the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's table was established in my home more than two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the beginning, when we were laying the foundation, more than twenty people believed and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A few of them had never been in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The rest came out of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we did not increase again until June of this year when two sisters were baptized into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were both more than seventy years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Recently, three or four more who are seeking the Lord and trust in Him have been added.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are still in a period of waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Last year two people went to sleep in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My wife was one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before she died she said two sentences to me: "In the future, you do not have to stay in the house, you can go out to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the Lord's Day come home."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She shut her mouth and stopped breathing after these words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This proves she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our meeting place is less than two miles from a denominational gospel chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the preacher of this group saw that we had left the denominations, he became contentious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He began to slander us before the people who went there to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is very diligent in his labor of "sweat."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every Saturday he visits the homes of the worshippers to charge them to come worship on the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His diligent watchfulness shuts them in as tightly as the doors of the city of Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are really too immature.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can only drink milk and cannot take solid food, so our meetings are very low.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I believe that God is almighty and a day of stirring up will come.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If this were not true and He knew that I was cold, why would He grace me in the first place?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I went to Shanghai in January to attend the Overcomers' Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I received both God's enlightenment and the brothers' help.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During the conference, I first heard Mr. Lee speak on the living of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He said that toward the Gentiles we should be proper in everything, and we should keep our position in dealing with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Next I heard Mr. Nee say that if a Christian has not been sent, he should return to his own occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After the conference, I returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I prayed earnestly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I truly did not know what kind of occupation I should go into.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I did not have the strength to be a farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I did not have the capital to open a shop.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thank the Lord, He opened the way for me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He enabled me to return to my old occupation of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The school is in Hsu Chia Village about ten miles from my house.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is five miles from Ke Chia Village and seven miles from Chu Chia Kou.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although the supervisors are not brothers, they allow me to be free on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At first I planned to rotate between these three localities on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I did not know that I would feel a heavy burden once the Lord's Day came.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>So I still return home to meet every week.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although I walk twenty miles in one round trip, I am not tired.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The glory for this should be given to the Lord Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He has made it more convenient for me to read the Bible at school than at home.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the early morning I read five Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I read a few chapters of the Old Testament in the late morning and a few chapters of the New Testament in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I have more than enough strength to do this and can also discuss the teachings with two or three students.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is no one to oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Now I would like to ask the brothers and sisters in every place to pray for us because the believers in Chen Chia Yu are mainly backsliders.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Ask the Lord to revive the cold ones, uphold the weak, and free the oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I also ask you, brother, to teach such a useless one as myself how to walk in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Moreover, I ask that you pray much before God because the locality of Chen Chia Yu lacks gifted members.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Pray that the Lord would raise up priests to blow the horn before the ark of God while walking around the city of Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I will write more details about the other matters in another letter.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Chen Ju Ni</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>August 13, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>P.S. I am more than sixty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I am not very talented, nor have I studied in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>My eyes are going bad.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>My writing is very illegible.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Please tell the editor of Collection of Newsletters to feel free to delete, change, and make corrections as needed.</S>
