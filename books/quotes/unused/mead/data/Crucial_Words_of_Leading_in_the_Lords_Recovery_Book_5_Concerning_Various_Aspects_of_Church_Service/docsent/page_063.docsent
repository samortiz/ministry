   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having a Principle in Expounding the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers serving in the word must have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Message 1 of Life-study of Galatians says that Galatians, the first of four books that make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament, is concerned with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must study to find out what kind of Christ is presented in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Message 1 does not give us enough detail, we should read the footnotes, and if there is no explanation in the footnotes, we should consider which Life-study speaks of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The most appropriate Life-study would be on Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should spend time studying Philippians so that we can develop something without departing from the topic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first message also speaks of the background of the book of Galatians, which is that Judaism and the Mosaic law replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should thoroughly explain what Judaism is and that the principle of Judaism is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a teaching that is based on doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To many, the law teaches people how to do good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning all these points we should get into the footnotes, which contain a substantial amount of explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the way we should dig out material for the message.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not depend on imagination to minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read the Life-studies over a long period of time, we will find the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Proper biblical exposition points out principles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without a basis, we cannot say that Judaism is similar to Chinese ethical teaching, or that the Mosaic law is similar to Chinese ethics and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to speak according to the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A Jew must worship God by obeying the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Similarly, the Chinese have their own ethical teaching, morality, and laws.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to point out the principles, and we need to dig out material from the Life-studies and the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we gather material, we still need to practice speaking and consider how we should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must always digest the material and then apply the digested material in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the way to prepare for a message.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Digging into the Riches of God s Word</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We first need to dig into the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us return to Message 1 of the Life-study of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Galatians is a book concerning Christ, so we must dig and find Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we come to the section concerning the background, we must pay attention to two things in the background: religion and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also need to dig into these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to find ways to develop all the material that we have unearthed into our utterance, making the message rich and interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not so difficult to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we are willing to dig and to hold on to the principles, every message will be good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our material is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have Life-studies of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I was saved, I desired to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later, Brother Watchman Nee introduced Darby s Synopsis of the Bible to me, and I was overjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During that time and under very difficult circumstances, I browsed through other books in Christianity, but it was mostly a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, however, we have the Life-studies in our hand, and every message is profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should never take the Life-studies as mere reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be aggressive and enter into the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must not merely repeat a message that is used in both the small group meeting and on the Lord s Day, because God s word is too rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to have a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After hearing a message, we should not think that we do not need to hear it again; rather, we need to hear it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a vision will create an atmosphere among us of wanting to continually hear the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. L. Moody once spoke in a chapel, and he used John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The next day, after much consideration, he quoted the same verse, and he continued to speak the same message concerning how God loved the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After he left, the chapel was burned down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, when he was invited again, he still spoke on God s loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The chapel might have been burned down, but the truth that God loves the world will never be burned down.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The audience was not bored with the message; instead, they felt that the truth of God s loving the world was endlessly precious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The truth that we have touched is on the central line.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This includes the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, and God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All these truths are deeper than the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the messages in our Life-studies touch the central line.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we have a heart to mine these messages, we will discover that there is a gold mine in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Life-studies have been translated into many languages and have gone to all the continents in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is regrettable that not many saints have gotten into them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many saints have not even entered into the Bible, not to mention the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I earnestly hope that we all can diligently enter into the riches in the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was my attitude when I wrote the footnotes of the New Testament Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes I rewrote a footnote ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes when I woke up early in the morning, before getting out of bed I would consider whether the footnotes that were written the night before were thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I was in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, footnote 6 on 1 John 1:6 concerning the word truth has eight points, which were gleaned from reading various reference books and getting into the Greek grammar and studying it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that we are encouraged by this word.</S>
