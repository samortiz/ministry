   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THIS IS THE LIVING WHICH A GOD-MAN CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF GOD'S FIRSTBORN SON SHOULD HAVE IN EXPERIENCING THE CO-DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND CO-RESURRECTION WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man produce this kind of building of the co-living and co-walking of God and man, which is the living that a God-man conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son should have in experiencing the co-death and co-resurrection with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THIS IS ALSO THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OF CHRIST ARRIVED AT BY ALL THE GOD-MEN</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AS THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST IN THEIR GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The building up of the Body of Christ is through the co-living and co-walking of the two spirits in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is also the building up of the Body of Christ arrived at by all the God-men as the members of Christ in their growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things implies that in every point and every aspect of our daily life, Christ is increasing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To grow up into Christ is to allow Christ to grow and increase in all our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He grows, we will enter more into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the members of Christ will grow by the growth of Christ and eventually arrive at the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. Out from the Head, Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the Body Is Joined Together through</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every Joint of the Rich Supply</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those members who grow up into the Head, Christ, will be "out from" the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not grow up into the Head, Christ, there is no way for us to be "out from" Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we grow up into the Head, Christ; then we have something that is out from the Head for the building of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why Ephesians 4:15 speaks of growing up into the Head, Christ, and then is followed by verse 16, which speaks of being "out from" Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Out from Him, all the Body is joined together through every joint of the rich supply Eph 4:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The rich supply here must be a particular supply, the supply of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The joints of the rich supply refer to the specially gifted persons, as mentioned in verse 11, who are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Body of Christ there is the need for these joints of the rich supply to join all the parts together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus the Body of Christ will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. Out from the Head, Christ, All the Body</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is Also Knit Together Interwoven through</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>the Operation in the Measure of Each One Part</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body is also knit together through the operation in the measure of each one part Eph 4:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Each one part refers to each member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through the growth in life and the development of the gift, each member of the Body of Christ has its own measure, which operates for the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the various parts of the Body operate appropriately, all the Body will be knit together, that is, interwoven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Body of Christ has joints and various parts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The joints are for connecting; the various parts are for knitting together interweaving .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be joined and knit together, or interwoven, is to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, every building has its framework and its various parts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The framework needs to be joined together; the various parts need to be knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The framework is just an empty frame; there are many holes that need to be filled and knit together by the knitting work of every part between the holes, as in weaving textiles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of building by joining and knitting is very strong and sturdy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 4:16 uses the words joined and knit, which surely have two implications: one is the joining of the framework, and the other is the knitting, the interweaving, of the various parts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Body of Christ can be built up by the joining and knitting together through the supplying joints and the various functioning parts.</S>
