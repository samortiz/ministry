	 <h2 class="head1">OPENING OUR HOMES FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>Even though the people of God in the Old Testament did not receive the grace that we receive, Joshua was able to say, &ldquo;As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah&rdquo; (Josh. 24:15). Nothing gives us more blessing than opening our homes for the Lord. In the New Testament the couple Aquila and Priscilla is a sweet pattern. When they were in Rome, the church in Rome met in their home (Rom. 16:3-5), and when they were in Ephesus, the church in Ephesus met in their home (Acts 18:18-19; 1 Cor. 16:19). On the one hand, it is bothersome to a person to have meetings in his home. On the other hand, it is a great blessing.</p>
<p>As believers, it is reasonable for us to have meetings in our homes for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. A believer has no excuse for not opening his home for the Lord. Our homes should be full of the Lord&rsquo;s word. We should have not only the Bible but also our publications, and we should discuss the things of the Lord all day long.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING PROPER RECREATION</h2>
<p>In relation to man there is the principle that all our activities, including eating, drinking, sleeping, working, and resting, should be regulated. We need approximately three hours every day to eat three meals, eight hours to sleep, and eight hours to work. This is a total of nineteen hours, and this leaves five hours for recreation. God desires that man use these five hours to worship Him, pray to Him, speak about Him with believers and unbelievers, and sing hymns of praise. This is the best recreation.</p>
<p>Any other form of recreation will only produce sin. Going to nightclubs to eat, drink, and dance, or going to movies or concerts for recreation causes people to unconsciously fall into sin, because people in these places are loose and impure. The church life, however, leads people to Christ, and because He is pure, those who are under this atmosphere are spontaneously separated from sin.</p>
<p>The present cost of living in Taiwan is high, and many young couples must work to meet their financial needs. In spite of this, we can still separate at least two hours a day for the Lord. We can take some time in the morning to contact Him, and we can take some time in the evening to either attend a meeting or contact others. This is practical, and it is beneficial for our health.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING ANXIOUS FOR TOMORROW,<br />
BUT CASTING EVERYTHING ON THE LORD</h2>
<p>More than forty years ago I contracted tuberculosis. While I was sick, it was painful for me to see my children, because I did not know how I would care for them. I went to the Lord and asked Him to give me another fifteen years. At the time I was only thirty-nine years old. Today I still thank the Lord for giving me many more years. Matthew 6:34 says, &ldquo;Do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.&rdquo; We should take care of what we need to take care of today. This is especially true of the young people. If you need to obtain an education, you should obtain it. In order to meet the Lord&rsquo;s need and to take care of yourself, you should study hard and do well in school. This is your responsibility. When you get a job, you should fulfill your obligations and build up your character. This is also your responsibility. In this way, you will not be worried about what to eat and what to wear. Do not think about how much money you will make or how much you can save. One war can devalue any currency and cause the money to amount to nothing.</p>
<p>We are not asking the brothers and sisters to live in poverty. We should simply take what the Lord has given us and use it properly for the Lord. Concerning the principle of giving, in the Old Testament there were tithes. The children of Israel offered the Lord ten percent of what they received, and the rest of what they received was for their use. God established this so that His children could live, and His work and kingdom would have a future.</p>
<p>Taiwan has a population of almost twenty million, transportation and housing are convenient, and food is available. It is a shame that we have not spread the gospel. Therefore, we must produce full-time serving ones. Out of every twenty saints there should be one full-time serving one. In other words, nineteen working saints should support the needs of a full-time serving one. Some full-time serving ones have been forced to get a job because they are not receiving enough financial support to meet the needs of their family. This shows a lack among us. We need to live for the Lord, and we should not waste any money. Even though we do not need to be too frugal, and we should take care of the needs of our family, we must still offer our money to the Lord for His use. This is what it means to be faithful to the Lord, and it is the only way to be right with Him.</p>
<p>Since we love the Lord, we should not fear consecrating everything we have to Him. I can testify that the seed of a righteous man does not need to seek bread (Psa. 37:25). We have seen many who love the Lord and were blessed by Him. May we all be at peace. If a young person has the burden to serve full time, he should boldly become a full-timer without the fear of going hungry. He should give his time, home, and money to the Lord. The Lord will take care of us. The Lord wants us to be well educated. He also wants our second generation to receive a good education so that they can be healthy and serve Him.</p>
<p>We should thank God that even though Taiwan is small, it has a strong economy. The Lord in His mercy has made us rich. However, these riches are not for us to spend on ourselves without restriction; rather, they are for us to use in an appropriate way, without being excessive. Then we will have money for the Lord&rsquo;s use. We must do our best to preach the gospel, open our homes for meetings, and produce full-time serving ones who will work for the Lord.</p>
