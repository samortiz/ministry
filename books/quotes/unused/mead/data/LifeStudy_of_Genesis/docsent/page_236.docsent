   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. Making a Name to Deny</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's Name</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tower was also built for the purpose of making themselves a name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In seeking to make themselves a name, they denied God's name, that is, they denied God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What offended God the most was that the purpose of building the tower of Babel was to make a name for man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To make a name for man is actually to deny God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you read the next chapter, Genesis 12, carefully, you will see that when Abraham went into the good land, he did not build a tower to make himself a name; he built an altar that he might call on the name of the Lord 12:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here, at Babel, rebellious man built a city with a tower for making a name for man, but Abraham, in the good land, erected a tent for his dwelling and built an altar for calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That manmade tower at Babel was surely an offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To set up a tower for making ourselves a name is equal to denying God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is better that we conceal our name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you intend to get a name, it is better that you get a bad name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Result a. Scattered in Living</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first result of man's fourth fall was that mankind was scattered in living, no longer able to live together in one place vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Bible, the church in the first century was not scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church was spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, in all of our migrations, we have been spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Scattering means division.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we are not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are one and we are spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We expect more churches to be raised up in the years to come.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But that will not be a scattering; it will be a marvelous spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is not going to be scattered; it is going to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Confounded in Language</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Secondly, as a result of the fourth fall, mankind was confounded in language, no longer able to have the same language vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At Babel the language was confounded and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As I pointed out in Message Thirty-four, language is the utterance, the expression, of our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church we should not have different kinds of speaking, because in the church we should have only one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Romans 15:5-6, 1 Corinthians 1:10, and Philippians 2:2, the Apostle Paul charged the believers to be of one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have only one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people criticize us severely, saying that all the local churches are the same, speak the same thing, and have the same concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although they claim that this is terrible, I say that it is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reverse of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The curse always results in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If in the church in Anaheim we have different thoughts and opinions, that is a sign that the curse has come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In all the years that I have been in the work, I have never spoken a dissenting word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not mean that in every respect I was the same as the other co-workers, but I did realize that I should not be one who is under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone who is dissenting will be under a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not be dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are dissenting, you will be the first to be under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's commanded blessing of life evermore is upon the unity Psa 133:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I thank the Lord that throughout the years I have not received a curse but a blessing because I have never been dissenting with the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church life we must be on the alert not to say things differently.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not try to display your smartness or your sharpness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not try to show that you are better, higher, than others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sharpest one is the person who receives the blessing, and receiving the blessing depends upon our speaking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Romans 15:5-6 even speaks of having one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church should have one mouth because the church is one body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How many minds and mouths do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course, you only have one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you had two minds, you would be in a great deal of difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The reason that today's Christianity has so much trouble is that there are thousands of minds.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today's Christianity has hardly any hands or feet; it only has minds and mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every part is a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I was in that situation, I could not hear anything except, "I don't agree with that," or, "I don't think so," or, "I don't like it."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not even the wives would agree with the husbands nor the children with the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That is the poor situation in so-called Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That is why Christianity is full of the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What do we have in the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have the blessing because we have one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you visit the church in Hong Kong today and the church in Tokyo tomorrow, you will be surprised to hear them speaking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Recently I stayed in Taipei for a month and then spent a few days in Korea and Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The believers in Korea and Japan spoke the same thing as those in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although I could not understand the Korean or Japanese languages, I could understand their lips.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their lips were not confounded.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not Babel this is Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the day of Pentecost, all the different peoples with different languages understood one another Acts 2:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church life today is the real Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not have scattering; we have unity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We do not have confusion; we have one speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are truly Pentecostal.</S>
