        <h2 class="head1">SPEAKING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians chapter twelve, Paul refers to the matter of speaking in the meetings. In verse 2 he reminds the Corinthians, &ldquo;You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led.&rdquo; The worship of dumb idols had made them a dumb people. Because the object of their worship was a dumb idol, their worshipping made them a dumb people. But now the Corinthian brothers were different. They were not worshipping the dumb idols any more. They were worshipping the living God, who is the speaking God. This speaking God is just the speaking Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, who is also the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in verse 3 Paul says, &ldquo;No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; I like these two phrases, &ldquo;in the Spirit of God&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;In&rdquo; means that we all have been put into this Spirit. If you are not in Him, if you are not in the Holy Spirit, how could you speak something in the Holy Spirit? Can we all say that we are in the Holy Spirit? Be careful about my question. I do not ask is the Holy Spirit within us. We all have the assurance to say that the Holy Spirit is in us, but are we in the Holy Spirit? Doctrinally we may say yes. We have to know that the Spirit being in us is the essential aspect of the Spirit, and that our being in the Spirit is economical. I believe that many of us already know that the Spirit on the one hand is a drink to us, and on the other hand is clothing to us. Drinking is something within; clothing is something upon us. The drinking water is in us, and we are in the clothing. If the Holy Spirit is in us, then are we in the Spirit? Some Pentecostal people may say, &ldquo;No! You are not in the Spirit yet. You need a baptism with the Holy Ghost. You need to get into the Spirit. You need to pray and fast and learn how to turn your jaw to speak in tongues. Then you will have the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you will be in the Spirit.&rdquo; In verse 3 Paul did not say that no can speak in tongues except in the Holy Spirit. I cannot find such a word in the Bible. Paul said no one can say, Lord Jesus. Can you say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo;? If so you are in the Holy Spirit! Go and tell this to your relatives, friends, and colleagues. We do have 1 Corinthians 12:3 as a solid ground to say, and to say with assurance, that we are in the Holy Spirit. We do not need to speak in a strange tongue, but rather just say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and we are in the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we come to the meetings, we need to practice speaking this way in the Holy Spirit. Do not stand up in the meeting and say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, I have been very weak in these last two weeks. I&rsquo;m still weak. You can see how weak I am.&rdquo; This is terrible. When you stand up in the meeting to speak, stand up in this way, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters let me tell you, I am no longer weak! I am empowered in the One who empowers me, so I can do everything. Formerly I could not submit myself to my husband. Now it&rsquo;s easy for me to do it. I am the top wife. Hallelujah, brothers.&rdquo; This is the best speaking. In every locality, some saints have learned to be &ldquo;professional&rdquo; priests praying whenever the church comes together for the prayer meeting. These dear ones are the &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; to pray in the meetings. In the same way, some saints have become &ldquo;professional&rdquo; at giving a testimony at the end of the message meetings. I use the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; in a positive sense. That is, we all have to learn to be the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; speakers speaking in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When we open our mouth to speak, we need to open our mouth with the Spirit. Some may say, &ldquo;It is very hard to attend the meetings of the local church. I have to bear a lot of burden, learning of this and of that. But to be a member in today&rsquo;s Christianity is altogether a kind of relaxation. I have been busy working hard at the office, or going to classes during the week. On Sundays, I just like to go to church to relax. The choir will do the singing. The assistant pastor will pray. The pastor will speak, or perhaps an evangelist who has just returned from South Africa. After an hour and thirty minutes I will give some gift and then go home. I enjoy that I don&rsquo;t have to labor. But to be a member in the local church I have to learn how to be a professional speaker. To speak, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus&rsquo; is too hard. Everybody does it, so if I don&rsquo;t do it, I get exposed. Therefore I have to do something to pretend.&rdquo; My intention is to show you that the Lord today needs a recovery. Look at the situation which has been existing on this earth for twenty centuries. In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said He would build His church. Where is the building? Who affords a chance for Jesus Christ as the Head of the Body to build the church? Probably we are also quite busy, being occupied, usurped, by so many schedules, activities, and movements without Christ.</p>
<p>I would like to remind you of something Dr. A. W. Tozer once said. He put out an article entitled, &ldquo;The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches.&rdquo; In that article his burden was to point out that today Jesus Christ has almost no authority at all among the groups that call themselves by His name. Christian workers may come together to talk about serving Christ yet if Christ were to come in, they would not know Him. This indicates that He is not among them, He is not in their midst. He is outside of them. This corresponds with the word the Lord spoke in the epistle to the church in Laodicea (Rev. 3:14-22). In verse 20, the Lord Jesus is standing outside of the door of that church, knocking. This is the situation of today. There is no way, no possibility, no capacity, no space, for Him to come in to do any kind of building. This is why the Lord is here to carry out His recovery, and this is why we have such a burden.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:17 the church is referred to again. Here the church is not the universal church, but the local church. In the local church, two or three meet together into the Lord&rsquo;s name. The name denotes a Person. That means two or three are gathered into Him. Whenever in the home meetings two or three are gathered into Christ, that is the time for Him to build up the church. It is in the local church that there is the possibility of dealings. Even the sinning ones get dealt with there. Now you can see that actually the practical building of the church is not in chapter sixteen. The building that is mentioned, predicted, and prophesied in chapter sixteen will be carried out today in chapter eighteen, in the local churches where two or three meet together into Him. The big congregation can never build people up. We need the small meetings, small to such an extent that only two or three come together. In such a meeting there is the possibility for Him to build up the church.</p>
<p>Today what we are stressing is something up-to-date of the Lord&rsquo;s move and His recovery. He has to recover this unique thing. This is why I treasure the small meetings. There is no other way to build up the church but by all of us learning to speak Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ. We must speak in our daily life, in our office, in our school, in our family, in our ministry, and especially in the small meetings.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that Paul stressed this matter of speaking so much. In 1 Corinthians 12:7 Paul says that the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is given, not primarily as miraculous things, but as a word of wisdom and a word of knowledge. The word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God predestined by God for our portion. This refers to Christ in a deeper experience as revealed in 1 Corinthians 2:6-10. The word of knowledge is the word that imparts the definition, description, and understanding of Christ as God&rsquo;s everything. But we need to know this. We need the word of knowledge concerning Christ&rsquo;s riches, such as His being our righteousness, our wisdom, our power, our justification, our sanctification, and our redemption, and we need the word of wisdom concerning the depths of Christ. We need to speak these things. We need the word of wisdom to speak the depths of Christ, and we need the word of knowledge to describe all the rich aspects of Christ. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul says, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy,&rdquo; that you may speak for God (v. 1). In verse 4 Paul says, &ldquo;He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; To build up others and to build up the church we need to prophesy, to speak forth Christ. Then in verse 26 Paul says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm.&rdquo; This corresponds with Ephesians 5:18-19, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms.&rdquo; When we come together we should have a psalm for speaking Christ, or a teaching telling people the things concerning Christ, or a revelation, the word of wisdom, to unveil the depths of Christ. We have to do all for the building up of others and of the church.</p>
<p>All these verses show us that the way to meet, especially in the small home meetings, is to speak Christ. Learn to speak Christ. To practice this present move of the Lord needs a lot of learning. I do not expect that we could get this done successfully in a short time. I rather would expect initially to have a failure. To be successful in anything, there first must be some failures. If within the coming three years we could have the home meetings fully built up, this might be the greatest mercy and grace that the Lord would give us. Pray for this. I just present this to you and to your discernment. I hope that you all could have the best discerning ability in your spirit that you would say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, this is no doubt the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move to accomplish, to carry out, His recovery for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose in building up the church.&rdquo;</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
