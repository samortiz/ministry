   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Pouring Out His Blood for the New Covenant and for the Forgiveness of the Believers' Sins</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As part of His work in His death Christ poured out His blood for the new covenant and for the forgiveness of the believers' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Luke 22:20 the Lord says, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God made a covenant with redeemed Israel in Exodus 24:3-8 Heb 9:18-21 , which became the old testament, as a base for Him to deal with His redeemed people in the dispensation of law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ came to accomplish God's eternal redemption for God's chosen people by His death, according to God's will Heb 10:7, 9-10 , and with His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant Heb 8:6-13 , which became the new testament after His resurrection Heb 9:16-17 , as a base for God to be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This new covenant replaced the old covenant and simultaneously changed God's old dispensation to His new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus wanted His disciples to know this and live a life based on it and according to it after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 26:28 the Lord Jesus says, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's blood was required by God's righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God's righteousness so that the new covenant may be enacted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Christ's blood was poured out for the forgiveness of sins, and the new covenant has been enacted with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The blood of the Lord Jesus has made a complete redemption for us so that all our sins may be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His blood has redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and to God's full blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's blood, having satisfied God's righteousness, enacted the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in His work Christ poured out His blood so that the new covenant may be enacted and the believers' sins may be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In one of his hymns Charles Wesley speaks of Christ's five bleeding wounds received on Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Four of these wounds were the wounds in His hands and feet received when He was nailed to the cross, and the fifth wound was the wound in His side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first four bleeding wounds were a matter of persecution, but the fifth wound was a matter of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luke 22:20 and Matthew 26:28 both indicate that Christ's blood was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, this blood was poured out by the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we may think that it was the piercing of the Lord's side by the soldiers that caused His blood to pour out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the human point of view, the Roman soldiers pierced the Lord's side, and His blood came out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But from Christ's point of view, He poured out His blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The pouring out of the Lord's blood spoken of in Luke 22:20 and Matthew 26:28 refers to the blood that poured out of His side, not to the blood that issued from the wounds in His hands and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The latter was related to persecution, and the former, to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often we speak of the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus, however, said that His blood was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He poured out His blood not for the suffering of persecution but for the accomplishing of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may seem that the Roman soldiers took the initiative to pierce the Lord's side to cause His blood to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the Lord Jesus took the initiative to pour out His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the pouring out of the Lord's blood had resulted from the piercing by the soldiers, it might only have been for the suffering of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But according to the Lord's own word, the pouring out of His blood was for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a great difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the pouring out of Christ's blood was a matter of His being pierced by the soldiers, then this would have been a work accomplished by the soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the pouring out of Christ's blood was not the work of Roman soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the sight of God this was Christ's work in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord did a great work when He poured out His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This did not take place during the first three hours of His crucifixion when He was persecuted by man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, it happened during the last three hours when He was working to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yes, Christ's pouring out of His blood took place through the piercing by the soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the pouring out of His blood for our redemption was actually Christ's own work.</S>
