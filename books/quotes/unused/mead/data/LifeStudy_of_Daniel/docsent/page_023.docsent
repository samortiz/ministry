   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In his interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, Daniel said, "You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of the heavens has given kingship, power, and strength and glory....You are the head of gold" 2:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Nebuchadnezzar thought about Daniel's interpretation, he might have considered himself to be someone great.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, in chapter three he erected a large golden image, possibly signifying himself, for people to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It not only had a head of gold, but the entire image was of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Daniel was a prefect ruling over the largest province of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He realized that the great image was being set up for people to worship, and he anticipated its dedication.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since he is not mentioned in chapter three, it is likely that he went away and prayed for God's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God had received much worship in the temple in Jerusalem, but that was destroyed, and the utensils for worshipping God were brought to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's interests on this earth were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, there were some overcomers in Babylon, and Daniel was one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that Daniel stayed away from the dedication of the image in order to pray for his three companions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his prayer he might have said, "God, You must preserve us and keep Your worship on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your worship should not be cut off, frustrated, violated, or changed by anyone."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Daniel's three companions answered Nebuchadnezzar boldly, saying, "There is no need for us to give you an answer in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace of fire, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up" 3:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were thrown into the furnace of fire, but the fire had no effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, at the end of chapter three, the king admitted in a good spirit that these three young men had changed his word and were not afraid to yield their bodies to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him and changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God" v. 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the beginning of chapter four, Nebuchadnezzar again offered praise concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we will see, in this chapter Nebuchadnezzar, who continued to walk in pride, was abased by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God exposed him and showed him that he was not a gentleman but a beast.</S>
