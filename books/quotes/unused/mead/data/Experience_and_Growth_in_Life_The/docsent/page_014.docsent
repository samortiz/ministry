   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE FIVE THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: Phil 1:21; Rom 8:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible, especially the Gospel of John, presents the divine and mysterious things in very simple words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 14:19 says, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus spoke this word to let His disciples know that in resurrection He would be transfigured from His physical body of blood and flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His resurrection He would live, and they would live also.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This word itself is very clear, but the nature of our relationship with Christ is not so apparent from this word alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word spoken by the Lord implies the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The basic truth of the mingling of divinity with humanity is seen throughout the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although some have condemned the use of the word mingle, the word mingle as defined by Webster's Third International Dictionary gives an accurate description of our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It states that to mingle is "to bring or combine together or with something else so that the components remain distinguishable in the combination."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LIVING CHRIST BEING A MINGLED LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Philippians 1:21 says, "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To say that we must live Christ is easy, and to understand this simple phrase is also easy, but for us to actually live Christ involves a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To live Christ means that when Christ lives, we who believe into Him and who are now in Him also live.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ lives, and we live also John 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that we live in Christ's living and that He lives in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we live in His living, His living will also be in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the mingled living of two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God and man live together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This mingled living is illustrated by the grafting of two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a branch is grafted into another tree, the two live together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, they are two, but on the other hand, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are one, yet their two natures remain distinct, and a third nature is not produced.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1935 as a young co-worker, I stayed together with another co-worker who was a few years older than I was.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During our stay together, I committed many small offenses toward him, so I apologized to him quite often each day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After a number of days, when I went to apologize to him again, he said, "To apologize is good, but not to offend is better."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This disappointed me very much because I could not stop making offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One of my frequent offenses was to spill a few drops of water on his bed as I brought water from the rest room into our bedroom to wash myself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, this was a very small thing, but according to my conscience, I had committed an offense, so I had to apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I practiced this according to the instruction I had received about keeping a conscience without offense toward God and man Acts 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I tried very much to practice this, but it was rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I had been careless, I could have spilled a little water on the brother's bed without being bothered, but that kind of careless living or behavior kills our fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although I exercised to keep my conscience void of offense, I had not been fully helped to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through many years of experience, I have learned that the Christian life is more positive than merely keeping our conscience void of offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We Christians should keep a clean conscience, but the main point of our Christian life is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To live Christ should be our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether our conscience is clean or not is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Living Christ should be primary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the troubles in our Christian life come because of our not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To merely keep our conscience clean is to be in the realm of morality and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The practice of keeping my conscience clean was a help, but it also became a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As I look back on those early experiences, I now realize that morality and ethics is not the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today I would never stress only the matter of keeping your conscience without offense; rather, I would charge you to forget about all the other things and live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To live is not ethics or morality but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To a banker, to live is his money and the current interest rate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The interest rate is always on his mind, and he is always looking at the newspaper to find out what the current interest rate is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To a stockbroker, to live is the stock market.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To the young, ambitious college students, to live is to get the highest degree in the best field.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a trainee in the training, you may think that to live is the training.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, our living should be Christ.</S>
