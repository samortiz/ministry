   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONDUCT WORTHY OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last part of Philippians 1 and the first part of Philippians 2 are actually one portion and should not be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One thought flows from 1:27 through 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1:27 Paul says, "Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. When I read this verse years ago, I thought that conduct worthy of the gospel was behavior that was perfect before those to whom we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this is not Paul's meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The remainder of verse 27 says, "That whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. Paul does not speak here of loving our wives, submitting to our husbands, honoring our parents, or behaving in a kind, lovable manner.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, he tells us to stand fast in one spirit with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not in one spirit with one soul, then our conduct is not worthy of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how many of us there may be in a locality or on a campus, in our preaching of the gospel everyone must be fully impressed that we are in one spirit and with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nothing is more convincing than this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When all the members in the church are in one spirit with one soul, this oneness will be convincing, subduing, and attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we have such a subduing and convincing oneness, we shall experience Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We shall enjoy Christ by being in one spirit with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By preaching the gospel we express our oneness in spirit and in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we preach the gospel in this way, we have the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we preach like this, the more we enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We shall be able to say, "We don't care mainly for how many souls are saved, or for how many people are brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are enjoying the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We shall be full of enjoyment, and the preaching of the gospel will be a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we do not sense that we are feasting on Christ as we preach the gospel, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We lack the oneness in spirit and in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we are in one spirit with one soul, the number of people saved through our preaching of the gospel will be secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The primary thing is that in the course of our preaching, we shall be feasting on Christ and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We shall have not only experience, but also enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 29 says, "For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although in this verse Paul speaks of suffering, in reality to suffer for the sake of Christ is to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we suffer for Christ's sake in the preaching of the gospel, we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>PAUL'S REQUEST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The concept expressed in the last part of chapter one continues in the first part of chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 1 says, "If there be therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>. When Paul spoke of encouragement here, he was speaking of encouragement to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He seemed to be saying, "I am suffering a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have heard of my suffering in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hope that you have some encouragement for me in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I also hope that you have some comfort of love, some fellowship of spirit, and some tender mercies and compassion."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 2 continues, "Fulfill ye my joy, that ye think the same thing, having the same love, one in soul, thinking the one thing" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>. In this verse Paul asked the Philippians to make his joy full.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that their situation should not be one that troubled him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul seemed to be saying, "Your situation bothers me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although you preach the gospel, you are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am suffering in prison for this gospel, but you are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your lack of oneness does not encourage me; it troubles me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It does not comfort me or give me the proper fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are not showing mercy to me because you are bothering me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Don't you Philippians believe that you should have some mercy toward me and have some compassion on me?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I beg you to fulfill my joy."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul was not asking the Philippians to fulfill his joy by sending him more offerings or by endeavoring to do something to secure his release from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That would not have been a comfort to him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What would have comforted Paul was that the Philippians would think the same thing, have the same love, be one in soul, and think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul seemed to say, "If you do these things, you will be merciful to me, and you will be an encouragement to me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such oneness will be a genuine comfort of love to me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But now you are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, you are killing me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I beg you to be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am like an old father, and you are like my dear children.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your fighting with one another troubles me very much."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was Paul's concept in verses 1 and 2.</S>
