   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO RECEIVE BASIC TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the fourth point, that is, the need for all the brothers and sisters to receive the same training.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Believers' Training Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to offer the new believers a special kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Shanghai and Foochow we have already offered this training to the new believing brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This meeting is the same every year.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not want to move on to something new.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, we do not want these training lessons to be recited like the Lord's prayer to some people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the speakers are living, there will be life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These instructional lessons are given in sequence from the beginning of each year to the end. After fifty-two weeks, the cycle is repeated again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When each brother goes out, he will at least have received all the basic instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, we will eliminate some of the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If some come into our midst, regardless of which week they join, they will finish the whole training in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After fifty-two weeks, the cycle will repeat itself again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If they come in at the tenth week of the first year, they will complete the cycle of training and teaching when they approach the ninth week of the following year.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone should get the same instructions and then be ready to be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sent Out to Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Advise them that when they migrate to a place they should try their best to save souls in the locality where they live.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, we should first bring men to salvation in the locality which is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These people should be edified and sent out to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They should be given the opportunity to go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way the whole church will preach the gospel, not just the evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If only the evangelists do the preaching, they can never complete the preaching of the gospel throughout China in their lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the population in China is 450 million, but not more than one million are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If these one million Christians are in our hand and everyone is sent out, we can evangelize China.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to help them receive the same kind of training and then send them out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will see the church preaching the gospel everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They go out to preach the gospel because they are sent out, not because they are persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps they will meet persecution, but the main thing is that they must go out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some arrangement is necessary, and the leading brothers must make these arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some localities are strategic geographically, and we must take them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps we first should send three or five men there to take up some kind of employment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we might send a few more to take up other employment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When people are brought to salvation through them, the co-workers can then go there to raise up a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to go on, we need a change from the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way to go on in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Church Being Fruitful When It Preaches the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today all the brothers and sisters acknowledge that when the church preaches the gospel there is always more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only the work of the church can become more fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Recently, a group of brothers went to Kutien to preach the gospel, and a total of more than fifty were saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Chen returned and said that when he left he did not know what the result of the church's preaching of the gospel would be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But after his trip to Kutien, he had no more doubts: When the church preached the gospel, men were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without advertisement, one person simply took hold of one or two other persons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a short time more than fifty were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the past Nan-Ping had only a few saints in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the brothers went there recently, more than twenty people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These people heard the gospel during the great fire in Nan-Ping, when only one fourth of the city was spared.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>About ten homes of our brothers were also burned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Huang s store was burned too.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when the whole church preached the gospel, a number of people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our brothers wrote and said that since they discovered this way, they would give their lives for it and not turn in any other direction.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While the church is preaching the gospel, the Lord is working.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We did not have to use any advertisement or apply any human methods.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The brothers simply went out, each one bringing in another, and the people came.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It matters little if the message is somewhat weak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as the church is preaching the gospel, scores upon scores of people will be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the future this work will be passed on to the local brothers; they will do the work themselves.</S>
