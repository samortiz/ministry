<p>Second Corinthians 3:3 says, &ldquo;Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&rdquo; We, the New Testament believers, are living letters of Christ. The believers are the fruit of the apostles&rsquo; labor, commending the apostles in their ministry to others. Thus they have become the apostles&rsquo; living letter of commendation, written by the apostles with the indwelling Christ as the content in every part of their inner being. A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey and express Christ. All believers of Christ should be such a living letter of Christ, that others may read and know Christ in their being. In this living letter Christ is all the letters of the alphabet. He is every letter composing every word that composes every sentence. The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ. The Spirit of the living God is the &ldquo;ink,&rdquo; the element, the essence, of the writing, conveying Christ as the alphabet, the sentences, and the words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Another crucial point is found in 3:7-11, concerning the New Testament ministry. The New Testament ministry here is called the ministry of the Spirit (v. 8), the ministry in glory (v. 8), and the ministry of righteousness (v. 9). This ministry is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life. The glory here is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God Himself shining forever in the hearts of the apostles (4:6), surpassing the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (v. 10). The ministry of the old covenant became one of death because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death (Rom. 5:13, 18, 20-21) and death unto condemnation. Hence, it was also the ministry of condemnation. The ministry of the new covenant is one of the Spirit that gives life (vv. 8, 6), because the new covenant brings in God&rsquo;s righteousness unto life (Rom. 5:17, 21) and life that brings forth righteousness. Hence, it is also the ministry of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRANSFORMATION FROM THE LORD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Verse 18 of chapter three says, &ldquo;And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the element of what He is and what He has done. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. Being transformed indicates that we are in the process of transformation. The same image means we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREASURE IN EARTHEN VESSELS</h2>
<p>Thus far, four figures of speech have been used: captives, incense bearers, letters, and mirrors. A fifth figure is used in 4:7 which says, &ldquo;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in the worthless vessels. This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Verse 13 of chapter four says, &ldquo;Having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.&rdquo; Speaking by the spirit of faith in our practical life is a great, crucial point. This very particular expression is used only once in the entire Bible. The spirit of faith is a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our spirit. The phrase &ldquo;spirit of faith&rdquo; places the spirit in apposition to faith. Faith is of the spirit. Therefore, the spirit of faith is faith. Our faith is just the mingled spirit. Furthermore, faith comes from hearing and hearing comes from the preaching of the word (Rom. 10:14). The very source of faith is the word (Rom. 10:17). This is why we must get into the Word. The more we get into the Word, the more we will have faith, and this faith is the spirit. Now by such a spirit you may speak the Word which is the source of your faith. Here is a cycle. The Word produces faith, faith is the spirit, and by this spirit you speak the Word. Your speaking will become the source of faith in others. The faith in them then becomes the spirit by which they speak.</p>
<p>According to the context, the apostle&rsquo;s speaking by the spirit of faith was related to the death and resurrection of Christ. Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; Paul spoke his experience of the death and resurrection of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
