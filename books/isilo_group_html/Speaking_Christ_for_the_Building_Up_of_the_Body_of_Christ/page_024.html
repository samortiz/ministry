<p>We need to learn how to practice our meeting in a practical way. The Christian meeting is an exhibition of the Christian daily life. We need to prepare ourselves for the meetings by praying, dealing with sins, being filled with the Spirit, and abiding in the fellowship with the Lord. According to my learning and experience from the past, if we are going to meet according to the standard revealed in the Scriptures, we must be praying persons. A praying person is one who not only prays but who also has a praying spirit with a desire and an aspiration to pray. If we are this kind of person, then we are prepared to attend any kind of meeting. Whenever we are intending to go to a meeting, we must spend some time to pray for at least five to ten minutes. If we have the time, we can pray for fifteen or twenty minutes, but we should not pray too long. A longer prayer can exhaust our spirit. If I walk for two hours, my legs will become tired. Likewise, our spirit can become exhausted if we pray for too long a time before a meeting.</p>
<p>A proper member of a basketball team will always prepare himself for the game. He must eat properly and make sure to get enough rest. He also has to dress in the proper clothing for the game. No one would come to play in a basketball game dressed like a bank clerk. Just before the game, the player participates in certain warm-up exercises so that he is fully prepared when the game begins. In like manner, we need to be prepared for the meetings that we attend. Instead of being prepared for the church meetings, many of the saints come to the meetings in a loose way. Some even sleep in the meetings.</p>
<p>If a number of saints are sleeping in the meeting, that will deaden the entire meeting. Even one person who is sleeping in the meeting can frustrate the speaking spirit. If I am speaking and some of the saints are sleeping, my speaking spirit is deadened. I would not stop the meeting and ask a sleeping one to leave, but I may forget my point when I see someone sleeping and become delayed in my speaking.</p>
<p>When we come to the meeting, we should come to the front as fighting soldiers to conquer the enemy and as prepared athletes to win the game. If we are going to be prepared for the meetings, we must pray. I sympathize with the saints who are so busy. I am a very busy person, but I always pray before I speak. We all need such a praying spirit. We must learn to get ourselves prepared to speak in the meetings by praying.</p>
<p>When we pray, the Lord will show us all of our faults, shortcomings, failures, defeats, wrongdoings, and mistakes. We must deal with our sins by confessing them to the Lord. We have to make a thorough confession of all our trespasses and offenses. If we would deal with our sins thoroughly, we will enjoy the filling of the Holy Spirit. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is so normal, yet it is altogether miraculous. It is a miraculous normality. If we pray and make a thorough confession of all our sins, we will spontaneously enjoy the filling of the Holy Spirit. We realize that we are filled with the Spirit by faith, not by our feelings.</p>
<p>Once you have prayed and dealt with your sins to be filled with the Holy Spirit, you must learn to abide in the fellowship with the Lord. When you have prayed, dealt with your sins, and are ready to come to the meeting, it is best not to receive a phone call. Sometimes one short phone call can deaden you. The enemy tries to frustrate us either from coming to the meeting or from coming to the meeting in a prepared state. If you do not have a meeting on a particular evening, no one may call you. But when you have a meeting, a phone call may come just before you leave for the meeting. According to my experience, most of these phone calls are calls with bad news. This bad news can kill you.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to be careful about when you open your mail on a meeting night. Your wife may have received the mail at noon, but she forgot to tell you about a letter for you until you are ready to go to the meeting. It is best for you to put this mail aside until after the meeting. Tell Satan, &ldquo;Satan, you better read the mail. This is not my business now. I&rsquo;ll come back after the meeting and read the mail.&rdquo; Many times the mail that is given to us right before the meeting has bad news to bother and frustrate us.</p>
<p>The husbands even have to be exercised in how they deal with their wives before the meetings. We all need to be wise by redeeming our time to keep ourselves in a good condition to attend the meeting. I hope we see that attending the meetings of the church is not a light and easy matter. For the sake of the meetings, we must learn to abide in the fellowship with the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
