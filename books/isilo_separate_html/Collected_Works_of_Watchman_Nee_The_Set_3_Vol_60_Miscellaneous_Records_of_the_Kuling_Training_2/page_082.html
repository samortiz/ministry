We want to expose its idolatry as well as its persecution of genuine believers. We have to help the new ones to know Roman Catholicism. Such knowledge will help them know how to deal with it and will save them from much frustration. Revelation 17:4 says, "And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication." If we consider today's Catholicism in the light of this verse, we must admit that this woman refers to the Roman Catholic Church. In the Roman Catholic Church there is purple and scarlet in every corner. The cardinals' robes are scarlet. The Catholic Church is full of precious stones, gold, and silver. The pope has two crowns, one representing his religious power and the other his secular power. Both crowns are made of gold. The one that represents his secular power has one hundred forty-six large diamonds, five hundred forty pearls, and seven levels of gold. This is the true picture of the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>"Having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations." Abominations refer to the idols. Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Daniel 9:27, 2 Chronicles 33:2, and Ezekiel 20:7-8 all say that idols are abominations. Please note the crucial items in Revelation 17:4. First, the woman is holding a golden cup. Second, the cup is for serving wine to others. Outwardly the cup is golden, seemingly divine. Gold signifies the divine nature. Yet this cup is filled with abominations. These abominations are the idols. They are introduced to all the world for worship by Roman Catholicism. The Catholic Church worships Mary because all other world religions have goddesses. Christianity is the only religion that does not have a goddess. Roman Catholicism brought in the idea of a "goddess" from paganism. It created Mary as a "goddess" and teaches men to worship her. We have to know this fact and have to help new ones understand that idolatry is an abomination in the eyes of God. A Christian cannot defile himself with any kind of idolatry.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HERESY OF MARY WORSHIP</h2><p>Mary began to be exalted in the fifth century. The title "mother of God" was applied to Mary at the time of the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431. There is a book called The Glories of Mary, written by a bishop called Alphonsus Maria De Liguori, in which he describes in detail how the Catholic Church exalts and worships Mary. Part I, Chapter VI, Section III of that book says that "Mary is the Peace-maker between Sinners and God." Chapter II, Section I says "Mary is our Life, because she obtains for us the Pardon of our Sins." Chapter V, Section I speaks of "The Necessity of the Intercession of Mary for Our Salvation." Elsewhere it says that those who fail and fall do so because they have not sought the help of Mary. It tells us that "the Holy Church charges all men to reserve a special place of worship for Mary"; a man can receive many things from Mary which he cannot receive from God, because as Chapter VIII, Section I says, "Mary delivers her Clients from Hell." She has dominion over all the kings of demons.</p><p>In Chapter VIII, Section III Mary is said to "lead her Servants to Heaven." No one can enter the blessed kingdom except through her. The way of salvation is open to man only through Mary. Since our salvation lies in the hand of Mary, those who are under her protection are saved, while those who are not will perish. Salvation is linked to Mary. To Catholics, Mary is intimately related to the Lord. She is eternally grateful to the Son for choosing her to be His mother. But at the same time, He is eternally grateful to her for giving Him His humanity. He has to repay what He owes her by glorying in her and honoring her in a particular way. He does this by answering her prayers and requests.</p><p>The book also said that Christ's authority has been given to Mary. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to you [Mary]." Everything (including God) has to obey Mary. God has subjected the entire church under Mary's dominion. Chapter VI, Section I says that "Mary is an Advocate who is able to save all." Whatever she decides to do, she is able to do it. It claims that Mary is almighty. It argues that the authority of the mother is as great as the authority of the Son. If the Son is almighty, so must be the mother. Some have even claimed that the whole church is not only under her grace but under her authority also.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> </body></html>
