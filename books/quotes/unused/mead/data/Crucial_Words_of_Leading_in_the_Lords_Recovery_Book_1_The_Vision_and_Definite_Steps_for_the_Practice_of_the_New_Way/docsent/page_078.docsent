   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXAMPLES OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN A CRAZY WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be persons who are burning in spirit and crazy before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether we are visiting the communities or going to a meeting, we must prepare ourselves by first being crazy at home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I once said that John Sung was called a mad preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was a person who was absolutely beside himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once, as a meeting was waiting for him, he suddenly appeared at the back door, singing as he entered, Down with Satan, down with Satan; out with sin, out with sin!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As he sang, the entire congregation came alive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was dressed in a traditional Chinese long gown.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As he stepped onto the podium, he would pull out some gambling cards from his sleeves and sing, Down with card games, down with card games; out with gambling, out with gambling! or Down with mah-jongg, down with mah-jongg; out with the devil, out with the devil!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At times he would hold out an opium pipe and sing, Down with the pipe, down with the pipe; out with opium, out with opium!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the end he would hold up a little coffin in his hand and say, Do you want to go on with your gambling?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your gambling will lead you to the coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you want to hold on to your opium?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your opium will lead you down to the coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After this he would sing again, Down with the coffin, down with the coffin; out with death, out with death!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Finally, he would make the call, saying, All those who want to be finished with these things, please come to the front.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A great crowd always would come to the front, weeping and crying as they walked forward, saying, I want to be finished, finished, finished with these things!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the way John Sung preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE CONDITION AND NEED FOR BEING CRAZY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In conducting any meeting and in working for the Lord, our first need is to be beside ourselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such craziness cannot be imitated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must first pray thoroughly, confess our sins, and be cleansed before we can be filled with the Lord and His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once His riches fill us, we will spontaneously be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in order to be crazy, we must first confess our sins, repent, pray, enjoy the Lord, contact Him, and be filled and clothed with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then when we come to the meeting, whether we sing or teach the truth, we will be full of impact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All those listening to us will be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After doing this once or twice, the saints will not need to wait for us to take the lead to be crazy; they themselves will become crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our meetings should not be old and stale, routinely starting with a hymn followed by some prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be beside ourselves in our homes before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should stir up our spirit at home and then come to the meeting hall with singing or prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we arrive, we should sing, praise, and pray with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of meeting will surely bring in God s grace and His timely speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the past three months every time we met together, I sensed no living prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Most of the time it was the full-timers who prayed in a fervent way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The co-workers and elders were quiet and observing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the co-workers and elders do not know how to be crazy and beside themselves, how can they lead the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order for the churches to go on, there must be proper leadership, and in order to have proper leadership, the elders must be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My wife often says to me, The minute you speak, you forget about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You forget about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what we all should do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As soon as we come to the meeting, we should be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as we speak for the Lord, we should be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only a person with a crazy spirit can conduct a meeting and make it come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being crazy has nothing to do with the outer man; it has to do with the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are crazy when our spirit is filled with the Lord s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are persons who live and walk in the spirit, as soon as we walk into the meeting the atmosphere will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we use our spirit and live in our spirit as we choose a hymn, our choosing will be full of the spirit, and our singing will be full of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our praying, reading, and speaking will all be full of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the basic qualification for conducting a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not use our spirit, our teaching of Truth Lessons will be nothing but dead reading, dead teaching, dead speaking, and dead listening.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is worse than the teaching in secular schools.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only do we need to live in the spirit; we must also stir up the spirit of all those in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The best way to stir up the spirit is to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I encourage us all to learn to sing our hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In particular, we should present this matter to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should tell them, When we come to the meeting, we should not be bound and reserved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are not here to attend a so-called worship service of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We meet to release our spirit and to fellowship with one another in the spirit, receiving spiritual supply and spiritual infilling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to do this, we need to open up our spirit and stir up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As the saints come to the meeting, we must encourage them and instruct them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They should pray and sing in threes and fives to stir up their spirit and to enliven the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do this, our meetings will be different.</S>
