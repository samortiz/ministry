   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I spent some time in fundamental Christianity and was eventually brought by the Lord into His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His recovery I entered into the inner life and experienced many things in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I also practiced the Pentecostal things and received much help from other kinds of Christian practices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From 1932 to the present the Lord has graced me to have four major successes in my ministry: in the church in my hometown of Chefoo, in Shanghai, in Taiwan with the Southeast Asian countries, and in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While in the United States I wrote the footnotes of the Recovery Version and gave the Life-study of the New Testament through semiannual trainings over about a twelve year period.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By October of 1984, I had finished the last footnote in the exposition of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I then felt that I was free to have more time to consider the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I realized that a number of the approximately nine hundred churches around the globe were in a somewhat dormant situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That bothered me and burdened me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After seeking the Lord for His way, I felt that something new must be brought in for a new start among us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What Brother Nee saw in 1937 and again in 1948 was in my mind and was also my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I realized that to build up the Body of Christ, to prepare the bride for Christ s coming back, and to conclude this age for the Lord s coming back to set up His kingdom on this earth, we must have something absolutely different from the practice of Christianity in the previous nineteen centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I reconsidered all the Bible verses concerning this matter, I gathered statistics concerning various Christian practices, and I reconsidered church history.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I came to the conclusion that we must do something by the Lord and with the Lord for a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I realized that Taiwan would be the best place to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seemed that everything was right for this, so I went there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I realized also that this could not be carried out quickly but would require much study and experimentation over a period of three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I told some of the brothers in the United States that during that period of time I could not do much to help them except to conduct the semiannual trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would spend my time in Taiwan to study and experiment in order to build up a model.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the model would be built up in Taiwan, I would have something to present to all the churches with all the revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My expectation is first that many faithful saints would go out to visit people and that daily hundreds would be saved around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, my expectation is that around the globe, in all the leading cities and even in the smaller cities, there would be home meetings in which the saints would function as living members of the Body of Christ, not in a big church building, but in small homes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thousands of these homes will be on the earth for the Lord s heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Third, my expectation is that around the globe many small groups of two or three families would meet in the New Testament way for the expression of the Body of Christ in their localities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fourth, my expectation is that the churches may have many district meetings of fifty to one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A large church may even have hundreds of these district meetings to represent the meeting of the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In these meetings everyone will function, everyone will minister, and everyone will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone will be able to dispense, to impart, the processed Triune God to their fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these items are the details of my expectation, and I have the full assurance that the Lord will accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not believe that it will take a very long time for the Lord to finish this matter that He may fulfill His great prophecy concerning the building up of the church as His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now you may understand where I am and what my burden and expectation are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do hope that we all would be for this and fully take part in this.</S>
