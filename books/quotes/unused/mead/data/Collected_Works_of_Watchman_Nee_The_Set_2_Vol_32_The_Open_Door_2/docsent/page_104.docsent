   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One is the perfecting of the young workers, and the other is how much a local church has come up to God's standard.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It then becomes a real problem as to how to lead them on and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more the work grows, the more we will see people turning to the Lord, and the greater this problem will become.</S>
