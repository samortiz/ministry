<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Third Way to Hell:<br>Trampling the Precious Blood</H2><P>The Bible mentions the word "blood" more than four hundred times. Since God mentions the blood so often, we know that the blood is very important. In the Old Testament the blood of cattle and sheep was mentioned often. This blood was shed in the offering of sacrifices. This pointed to the blood of the unique sin offering in the coming New Testament. The Bible stresses the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. This blood signifies the death of the Lord Jesus. When we talk about the blood of the Lord Jesus, we are speaking of the death of the Lord Jesus. The passport to heaven is the precious blood. No one can go to heaven except by the blood of the Lord Jesus. Hebrews 9:22 tells us clearly, "without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." We have all sinned; we recognize this fact. We have sinned very much! When we search our hearts in the deep of the night, does our conscience not accuse us of being sinners? When we think about our past failures, stumblings, falls, and transgressions, is our heart not sorrowful? How much we wish that we did not have those few dark pages in our history. If we think about the coming judgment for sins, do our hearts not tremble? Sometimes we think that a future hell is just in man's imagination. But when our conscience is clear, does it not tell us that there really is a hell? When we think about this, how can we not be fearful?</P><P>Once you realize this, you will know that you cannot go on without a Savior. Even though our sins must be punished, we are unwilling to be punished. But God must punish sins. So what can we do? In this situation we need the Lord Jesus. Man is sinful, and God in His righteousness must punish our sins. Therefore, God sent His Son to the world to be a man, and in the place of sinners, He suffered the punishment that sinners deserve. Man committed the sins, yet the Lord Jesus bore the punishment of sins. This is substitution. Such a substitutionary death is the gospel. Listen! The gospel is not about persuading people to do good, using their own merit to make up for their wrongdoings in order to redeem themselves. God knows that man does not have any merit because man cannot do good. Therefore, He asked His Son to come and shed His blood for men and redeem them from their sins. Now everyone who is willing to depend upon the merit of His blood can obtain forgiveness freely and be justified.</P><P>Now let us see what the Bible says about the precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Matthew 26:28 says, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." Acts 20:28 says, "The church of God, which He obtained through His own blood." Romans 3:25 says, Christ Jesus "whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood...in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred." Romans 5:9 also says, "Much more then, having now been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath." Ephesians 1:7 says, "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses." Ephesians 2:13 also says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ." Colossians 1:20 says, "Having made peace through the blood of His cross." Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" Hebrews 10:19-20 also says, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh." First Peter 1:18-19 says, "You were redeemed...with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot." First John 1:7 says, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." Revelation 1:5 says, "To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood." Having read these few verses, we know the reason that the Lord Jesus shed His blood; we also know the value of the blood He shed. His blood is for redemption. If there is no sin, there is no need for redemption. If there is sin, there must be redemption. In order for a person to be redeemed, however, a price must be paid. Therefore, the Lord Jesus died. He died and shed His blood. His blood can grant us forgiveness and make it possible for us to go to heaven.</P><P>Now I will talk about another way to hell. This way to hell is nothing less than trampling the precious blood. Please listen to the word of the Bible: "Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three witnesses. By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?...It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. 10:28-29, 31). These few verses clearly tell us that this kind of people will receive an unspeakable punishment; they will fall into the hands of the living God and be under His wrath. Of course, we know this means going to hell. The Bible tells us that if anyone offends Moses' law, he will die without mercy. Please listen. Whoever sins will die, and God will not have mercy toward them. Many people are kinder than God! They think that God would not punish sinners by sending them to hell. But the Bible says that this kind of person will die without mercy. It continues by saying that anyone who tramples underfoot the Son of God, despises His precious, redemptive blood, considering it insignificant, and rejects the moving of the Holy Spirit, will also go to hell.</P><P>What does it mean to trample underfoot the Son of God, to regard the blood of the covenant by which one was sanctified as a common thing, and to insult the Spirit of grace? It means that the Holy Spirit is gracious to man, prompting and telling him that he is sinful. The Spirit is also clearly presenting to man the salvation accomplished by the Son of God, causing him to know the effectiveness of the precious blood that forgives sins, and exhorting him to immediately accept the blood to wash away all of his sins. But some men are not willing; they reject the demands and prompting of the Holy Spirit. They still love sins and like filthiness and consider the precious blood of the Lord Jesus as something insignificant. He may say, "Listening to the gospel is good enough; but asking me to believe is putting too much emphasis on application. Yes, I have sinned but I will only commit the sins that I committed before. The Son of God loves me and gave His life for me, but why should I care about Him?" If a man says this, he will go to hell because he tramples the precious blood.</P><P>There is only one way in the world that can save man. The Lord Jesus died for sinners, shedding his precious blood to cleanse them from all sins. This blood is a guarantee before God that every sinner who believes in Him will be saved eternally. It is as if this blood speaks to God, saying that although sinners deserve to be punished, they have already been punished. Therefore, God cannot punish them anymore. All the sins committed by a sinner from his birth to his death have been punished in the Lord Jesus. The precious blood is the proof that every sinner's sins have been judged and punished. If this were not so why was the blood shed? Therefore, rejecting this blood will cause a sinner to perish eternally. A sinner's sins must be judged. The most important question is whether or not a sinner wants Christ to die for him. If he does not want this, he will have to bear his own sins. Therefore, trampling the precious blood is rejecting the substitutional death of Christ. Since he does not have Christ's substitutional death, he has to die and receive the judgment for his own sins which he deserves. Friends, you have heard about the function of the Lord Jesus' precious blood. Please do not harden your hearts; do not refuse this unique way of salvation. Do not wait until you go to hell and regretfully say, "How I hate myself that I did not accept the Lord Jesus' precious blood. Now I have to suffer here eternally." If you go to hell in the future, you will not go because of your sins, but rather because you rejected the Savior who died for your sins.</P>
