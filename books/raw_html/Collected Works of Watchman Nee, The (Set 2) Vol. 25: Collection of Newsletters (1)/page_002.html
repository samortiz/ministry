<H1 CLASS=MSG>PREFACE</H1><P>In order to facilitate fellowship between the churches and communication among the saints in various localities, Watchman Nee published Collection of Newsletters at the end of 1933. Its origin is explained in his open letter to all the brothers and sisters in the first issue of the magazine. Twelve issues were published over a period of two and a half years, with the last issue being published in July 1935. We have placed Issue Nos. 1 through 9 in Volume 25 and Issue Nos. 10 through 12 in Volume 26 of The Collected Works.</P>
