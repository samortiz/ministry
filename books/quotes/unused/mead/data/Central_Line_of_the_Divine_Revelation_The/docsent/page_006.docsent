   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God in Greek is Theos.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God, Theos, equals God, Elohim, in the Old Testament, denoting the unique yet triune God 1 Cor 8:4, 6; 1 Tim 2:5a the Father being God 1 Pet 1:2-3 , the Son being God Heb 1:8 , and the Holy Spirit being God Acts 5:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Theologians have accurately pointed out that the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three separate gods, but three hypostases, or supporting substances, of the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, theologians began to use the word persons for the three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Person comes from the Latin word persona, which was an actor's mask.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One person can have three masks or appearances.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I published something pointing out that the three of the Godhead are distinct but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are always one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we have the Father, we have the Son and the Spirit because the three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Son is here, the Spirit and the Father are with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The three are not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are distinct, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is three yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In essence God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In economy, in God's move, God is three.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the best theology refers to the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Essentially God is one, but economically God is three.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God the Father sent the Son in His economy, in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Son did things by the Spirit in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father, Son, and Spirit are three economically in Their move and administration, but not in Their essence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Essentially God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the Bible shows that the Son is the Father Isa 9:6; John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, Paul said that the last Adam, who was the Son in the flesh, after His death and resurrection became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said in 2 Corinthians 3:17 that the Lord, the Son, is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 18 Paul said that we are being transformed "from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Spirit is a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John indicates that the Son is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why the Son said, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He also said, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" v. 11 . Humanly speaking, no one can understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may say that we are one with another person, but no human being can say that he is in another one and that this other one is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is coinherence.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>10, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is because the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may say that they believe that God is triune, when they actually have a tritheistic concept of three gods.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Father, Son, and Spirit are not three gods.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are one God with three aspects the aspect as the Father, the aspect as the Son, and the aspect as the Spirit.</S>
