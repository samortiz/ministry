   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD WORKING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 13 says, "For it is God which worketh in you both the willing and the working for his good pleasure" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. We can work out our own salvation because God works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is mysterious, invisible, and abstract, but He is nonetheless within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be in fear and trembling lest we miss God, who is our daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we miss Him, we miss this practical salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It may seem that it is impossible for us to work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Philippians had said this, Paul might have replied, "Don't you know that God is working in you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is working in you both the willing and the working.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may say that you do not have the willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God is working the willingness into you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is also working in you for the working out of His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He works in and you work out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, there is no need for you to do the work by yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Take the example of driving a car.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we drive a car, does the car move us, or do we move the car?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not have the power to move the car.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, it is the car that moves us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For us to move the car is extremely difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But for the car to move us is an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are out of gasoline, we must move the car.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we have plenty of gasoline, the car moves us and we enjoy driving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, as we work out our salvation with fear and trembling, God is working in us both the willing and the working.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because He works in, we can work out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is like driving a car that is already running.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the car were not running, we could not drive it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In like manner, because God is working within us, we are able to work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, this is not something fearful; it is an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The only reason to be fearful is that we may miss the mysterious, marvelous God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to care for the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we take care of Him, He will drive the car, that is, He will work in us that we may work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>SAVED BY THINKING THE ONE THING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again I say that we work out our salvation by thinking the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the key.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to think the thing that God is working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we reason, God stops working.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And when He stops, we do not have any enjoyment; rather, we are in a hell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, our murmuring about things causes God to stop working and puts us into a little hell.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only thing that can cause our reasonings and murmurings to cease is to think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to remember the experience of Christ and to recall how excellent the enjoyment of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To think this one thing locks the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if a brother offends you many times, you need to be occupied with Christ as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not care for the brother's offense or allow it to touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, have your whole being filled with the thought of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When our being is filled in this way, we shall have no capacity, energy, or room to think of anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our being is filled with the thought of enjoying Christ, nothing will be able to offend us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of being troubled or offended by others, we shall say, "I am thinking the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah for the excellency of the enjoyment of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah for the experience of Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because God is working in us both the willing and working for His good pleasure, we can do all things without murmuring or reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If God does not work in us, we shall be murmuring and reasoning all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The occupation of the brothers is to reason, and the occupation of the sisters is to murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the brothers do not reason and if the sisters do not murmur, they will all be unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They will be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we think the one thing, everything else is excluded.</S>
