   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For this organic building to be realized, the gifted persons must do their best to perfect every saint.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The co-workers and the elders who are taking care of the saints need to go to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have a revelation as a new vision, we can call a meeting of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can even have a conference with the nearby churches to give a series of messages to cover a particular vision, a particular revelation, which we have received of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ordinarily and regularly, however, we do not need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ordinarily, we need the elders and co-workers to go to visit the saints' homes to teach them personally and directly, mouth to mouth, year round.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is not such a practice among us so far.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus far, many of the leading ones in the churches do a routine work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not enough for the elders merely to decide the meeting schedule of the church and come to the meetings in a routine way without any endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First of all, we ourselves have to dive into the Word to learn how to perfect ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we are being perfected ourselves, we can go to visit the saints house after house, day and night, to nourish them, cherish them, and teach them one by one sometimes with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will consummate in the perfecting of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will all be enabled to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Each one part will operate in its own measure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then all the saints will function, and there will be no clergy or laity among us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the saints meeting with us will be perfected, equipped, and furnished to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will issue in the accomplishment of the Lord's heart's desire, the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord has expected this organic building for almost two thousand years, but what is being practiced in today's Christianity is the traditional clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The mass of the believers are so-called laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here are two ways for us to choose from the old way of the clergy and the laity or the new way of the organic building up of the Body of Christ through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all must take the new, scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this new way we all have to labor diligently, especially the leading ones and the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not acceptable to prepare a message to speak once a week, and then take it easy the rest of the week to have leisure time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some have said that we should forget about the work and come back to the enjoyment of Christ, but we need to realize that the enjoyment of Christ always has an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a branch of the vine tree is really and richly enjoying the life juice from the tree, surely the branch will bear fruit John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the branch has not borne fruit for years, it has probably already been cut off 15:2a, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A person may think that he is enjoying Christ, but actually he may be cut off from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He may be self-deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have we been enjoying Christ year after year?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where is our fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I returned to Taipei in 1984, they only had three thousand in attendance at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today they have five thousand at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They also have thousands of new ones that they are caring for in home meetings and small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The saints and churches who have practiced visiting people in their homes with the gospel have testified of the fruitfulness of this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can we give a testimony in a definite way of the fruit that we have borne?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the way that I have presented to you is ordained by God and is according to the Scriptures, we have to practice it at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the Lord will have a way with us to finish His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Otherwise, we may force Him to drop us and go to others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord dropped others in His move and came to us sixty years ago, but where are we today?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The gifted ones the leading ones and the co-workers need to perfect the needy saints, not by speaking to them as a congregation but by visiting them in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some of the older co-workers may feel that they have become useless now that we are changing to the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, if the older ones pick up the new way, they will become more useful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their years of experience are needed for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not go along with the tide of the Spirit in this age, however, we will become dropouts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Time does not wait for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This why the New Testament tells us to redeem the time Eph 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The older ones are more useful, but they have to go along with the present advance of the Lord's recovery.</S>
