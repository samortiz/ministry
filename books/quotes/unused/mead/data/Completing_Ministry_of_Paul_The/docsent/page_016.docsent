   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:17-18, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. These verses are puzzling in their reference to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First we are told that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the Lord and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in the same verse we have the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This term sounds as if the Spirit is related to the Lord, but that the Spirit is one Person and the Lord another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verse 18 we have the term Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a compound title like Father God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we say Father God, we do not mean that Father is one and God another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same is true with Lord Spirit ; Lord and Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Electricity illustrates this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When electricity moves, it is called electric current.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The current, however, is not one thing and electricity another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The current is simply electricity in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Similarly, the Lord is the Lord; when He moves, He is the Spirit, or the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While the Lord is in the heavens, He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He comes to us, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit of the Lord is the Lord moving in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can say this from experience, not merely as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many men of God throughout the centuries have spoken this way also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God or Christ comes to us, it is as the Spirit that He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who is it that lives in us?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the New Testament, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do we have three Persons within?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot answer too hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Colossians 1:27 says that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 8:9 tells us that the Spirit of God dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How many are in us?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we have the Spirit, we have the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we have the Son, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With the Spirit we have both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we have one, we have all three!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit of the Lord is a wonderful Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit of life is mentioned in Romans 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This term is not easy to define.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life itself cannot easily be defined in words, but it is easily identified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you look at someone, you can tell immediately that he is alive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you go to a mortuary, it is plain to see that a dead person has no life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You do not need to declare that you are living or try to persuade others that you have life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They can tell even without a glance that you are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By the same token, it is immediately apparent when someone is dead: the life has gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you have the Spirit of life, you are living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You show signs of life!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates that you have God and Christ, who are life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This Spirit is not only the Spirit of life; He is also the One who imparts life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is life-giving!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a short term, but it is the greatest one!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How strange to say the Spirit was not yet !</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Spirit of God had already been mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments many times.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is meant by the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because Jesus had yet to pass through death and resurrection and be glorified, the Spirit of Jesus Christ the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today we have this Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have received the promise of the Spirit through faith Gal 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>OUR SPIRIT Born of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Physically we were born of our parents, but, when we were regenerated, we were born of the Spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By believing in the Lord Jesus, our spirit was born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The all-inclusive Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate it with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Spirit with Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now that the Spirit is within our spirit through regeneration, He witnesses with our spirit, testifying that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These two spirits within us correspond to each other, together confirming that we are God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One Spirit with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Spirit today is the Triune God with human nature, human living, Christ s all-inclusive death, and also His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our spirit is mingled as one with this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Your aspiration may be to walk in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You may have read Brother Lawrence s booklet, The Practice of the Presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you realize that to be in God s presence is an Old Testament concept?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Abraham walked in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However close to God you walk, however much you fear Him and seek to please Him, you and He are still separate from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The New Testament does not exhort us to practice God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Abraham did not experience this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God was not in Abraham, nor was Abraham in God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>At best, Abraham could walk in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We are one spirit with God!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What a tremendous difference from merely being in His presence!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Not only are we one with God; we are also one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The day I saw this I was thrilled beyond words.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>From that time on, I began to practice being one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I failed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I behaved well.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I did not lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>My conduct was above reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Nonetheless, the good things I did were apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Being close to Him or walking in His presence is not the same as being one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I loved the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I loved the church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I was humble in my manner and kind in my relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Nonetheless, at the end of the day, I would find myself confessing my failure.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This whole day has been a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I loved the saints, but I did so apart from You.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I did many kind deeds, but I did them apart from You.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I did not live one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I was practicing Christian ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I did not practice being one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Forgive me, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Wash me.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>How well I know now that it is not easy to practice being one spirit with the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>For over fifty years I have been practicing good behavior, spiritual ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It is easy to control my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is easy to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It is easy to treat people pleasantly.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>For all these years I have been building up these habits.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Why do I need the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>He can stay away, while I live my highly moral life from morning till evening.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>It is spontaneous and natural for me to live in such a virtuous way.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>When it comes to practicing one spirit with the Lord, however, the only time I succeed is when I am in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When the prayer is over, I slip away.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Since I saw that we are one spirit with the Lord, I have been exercising to stay with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I dare not leave Him.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I must remain in Him, constantly praying.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>He says, Abide in Me and I in you....I am the vine, you are the branches John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>This mutual abiding is not the practice of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>It is rather the practice of being one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The Mind Set on the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The mind set on the spirit is life and peace Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>All day long we must set our mind on this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Walking according to Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>To walk according to spirit Rom 8:4 is to practice being one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We must set our mind on and walk according to this one spirit, our spirit mingled with His.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Lord, we can tell Him, I don t care whether I love others or hate them.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>It doesn t matter whether I am proud or humble.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>These things no longer concern me.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>All I want to do is to set my mind on the spirit and walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>I want to practice this spiritual fact: that I am one spirit with You.</S>

   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Do not try to overcome sin or the world.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Do not try to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Simply set your mind on the spirit, and walk according to this one spirit.</S>
