This work was His releasing of the divine life within Him as the grain of wheat (John 12:24). The divine life was concealed in His human shell. The cross broke His human shell, and the divine life within Him was released. His death was a life-releasing death. The death of Adam is dark, but the death of Christ is bright. According to the divine autobiography, His all-inclusive death has also become an element of His being. After this death, He entered into His marvelous resurrection with His ascension.</P><P>Today He is an all-inclusive person as the processed and consummated Triune God. He has divinity, humanity, human living, an all-inclusive death, and an all-inclusive resurrection. We have to add these five things together&#151;divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, and the all-inclusive resurrection. When these five things are added together, we have today's processed and consummated Triune God. This One is our God, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, our Master, our Head, our reality, our life, our living, and our everything. If some ask us who our God is, we should tell them all of this.</P><P>My God is a composition. He is composed of divinity, humanity, human living, an all-inclusive death, and an all-inclusive resurrection to be my God, my Redeemer, my Savior, my Lord, my Master, my Head, my reality, my life, my living, and my everything. This is my God! Then I would ask, "Where is your God?" This God of such a wonderful composition is right now within us. He is also mingling Himself with us to make us exactly the same as He is in life, nature, element, and essence, but not in the Godhead. We have to see all of this; then we will have an all-inclusive view concerning the contents of the Christian life.</P><P>I would encourage us to dwell on this short fellowship. Many Christian books are not in the central line of God's New Testament economy. They are not helping to write "Christian biographies" according to the autobiography of the Triune God. Even we ourselves are not so clear concerning what the real Christian life is. This is why I am burdened to have such a line on the Christian life. The content of the Christian life is the processed and consummated Triune God. To be consummated is to be completed. It is to be wrought with something until there is a completion, an accomplishment of having been wrought.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Christian Life &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
