<p>In these chapters we have seen that Christ is all and in all. Christ is all and in all in God&rsquo;s plan, in creation, in redemption, in the believers, in the church, in God&rsquo;s administration, in the kingdom, in heaven, and in eternity. Christ is all. He is God who planned all things, and He is God&rsquo;s plan. He is the Creator, and He is a creature. He is the Redeemer, and He is redemption to the believers. He accomplishes redemption, and He enters into the believers as redemption. He is our redemption. As the Head, He is life to His people, and He is life to the church as the Body (Col. 1:18; 3:4), the believers who are His members (1 Cor. 6:15; Eph. 1:23). Hence, the believers are Christ, and the church is also Christ. He is the Administrator in God&rsquo;s universe and the King in God&rsquo;s kingdom (Rev. 11:15). He is both the dominion and the glory of the heavens. He is the center and the expression of eternity. He is all! He is the way, the reality, and the life (John 14:6). He is the truth (8:32, 36). He is the light and the power (1:4; 1 Cor. 1:24). He is the bread of life and the eternal, living water (John 6:35; 7:38). He is righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). He is our consolation and our rest (Luke 2:25; Phil. 2:1; Matt. 11:28). He is our trust and our hope (Col. 1:27). He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End (Rev. 21:6). He is everything in the universe. There is life in the universe because He is the life. There is light in the universe because He is the light. There are meekness and humility in the universe because He is meekness and humility. There are love and patience in the universe because He is love and patience. He is the reality of everything in the universe. Everything in the universe is false and vain without Him, but with Him everything is true and real (Col. 2:17).</p>
<p>Christ is everything; everything is in Him and with Him. God is in Christ. God&rsquo;s plan and work are in Him. God&rsquo;s creation and redemption depend on Him. The believers and the church are begotten in Him, and He upholds all things. We cannot know God or His plan apart from Christ. Apart from Christ there is no creation or redemption. Apart from Christ there are no Christians and no church. Apart from Christ there is no administration or kingdom. All these matters are focused on Christ and take Him as their center and goal. Christ is their source and consummation. All these matters are in Christ and are headed up in Him. God is in Christ, and man is also in Him. The Creator is in Christ, and the creatures are also in Him. The Redeemer is in Christ, and the redeemed people are also in Him. Everything is in Christ, and He bears everything. He comprises all and upholds all. The whole universe, all creation, man, and God are focused on Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is outside of time, yet He also lived in time. He transcends space, but He was also limited by space. He exists in eternity as well as in the present. He is in heaven as well as on earth. In the past He was in Peter and Paul, yet He is also in us. We worship Him as the One in heaven, and we also sense that He is in us. We praise Him for His living in the land of Judea long ago, but we also sense that He is with us. He fills time, space, and matter. This is the Christ of God, our glorious Lord. One day all things will be filled with Him and will express Him. He will be magnified in all things and will occupy the first place in all things (1:18).</p>
<p>Christ has entered into us to make us the firstfruits of His expression to bring in this glorious day. If we see this, our Christian life will be changed. We will focus on Christ as our center and goal and live in Him so that He would be all and in all. This is the goal that God wants to attain, and this should be our pursuit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
