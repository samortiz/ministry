   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have not seen this brother before, but from his letter, we know something of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Dear Brother Yueh Ch'iao:</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I received and read your postcard at the end of 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I had already thought about writing you and asking you the dates of the next conference, but I was entangled by my flesh and did not get around to it until now.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord, He is overcoming!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although Satan's authority is everywhere, the Lord released me through the power of Golgatha!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Glory and honor and authority to Him forevermore!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since the Lord's Spirit enlightened me to see the sin of denominations and the corruption of organization, I have felt very hungry and thirsty for the Lord within, but because I am a milk-drinking child, my spiritual life is very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I thought that every child who was enlightened by God would have the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I wanted to wait until a so-called "comrade" was raised up for me and then leave the system.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To tell the truth, I was afraid of the loneliness of the way of the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Did I not know that "constricted is the way..., and few are those who find it"?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unfortunately, I was foolish in spirit and did not obey God earlier!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>During the summer vacation the Lord prepared a way for me to go to Shanghai and called me to go.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>My spirit wanted to accept the Lord's arrangement, but the flesh was still weak; I actually followed my flesh and went home.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The local group of this denomination wanted me to "use a reed for a weapon."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I also followed my flesh to go work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In those two months, the suffering of failure was too much for words.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May all this shame be upon myself!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thank God, He showed me the result of not obeying!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After the summer vacation I still went on in the way of error and went back to Wu Ch'ang as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord loves me to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although my flesh is weak, He has continuously enlightened me, disciplined me, and supported me with His power.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When I saw the news that you were going to have a meeting over winter vacation, my spirit was desperate for this matter!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But I did not know to use the cross to deal with my flesh, and Satan still had the opportunity to hinder me!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I asked you to send The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages to my home in Ch'ang Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>My wife read them and then sent them on to me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She usually sent them immediately after reading them, but this time, she did not send them until January 2.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I did not know that you were meeting on the twenty-first.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, the Holy Spirit gave me special enlightenment; I suddenly felt within that I must decide on the matter of going to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On the one hand, school did not let out for vacation until the twenty-fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How could I have handled this temptation?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It seems that it would have been hard to put it aside!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>With this one thought, I quenched the leading of the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On the twenty-fifth, I read a classmate's copy of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>At first I was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then I saw the dates at the end and was disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I looked at the newspaper for steamer times.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There were ships leaving on both the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I prayed earnestly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>On the next day I fasted and prayed, but God did not give me an "answer."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I only saw the work of Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Christ always overcomes!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Although the enemy hindered my steps, "the Lord made my steps light!"</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I did not follow my flesh to return home this winter vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I did some writing for the school and had an opportunity for quietness so I could review an important lesson He had given me The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It released my spirit and brought me more into the experience of having my flesh dealt with by the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I used to demand that God fulfill "my" desire to graduate from the seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Now my prayer is, "God, I am willing to obey You and follow Your way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>May Your will be done in me."</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Since the Lord's word has separated my soul from my spirit, I can only place my soul in a position of death.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I only have one more year until I graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>According to the flesh it is a shame because I will miss success by a very narrow margin.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I may even meet with opposition from many people.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>However, I am willing to follow the Lord's calling and give it up!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I ask the Lord that I may be able to boast in His cross!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>School will be in session in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I am waiting for God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If He allows me to go to Shanghai, I will meet all the brothers, and we can remember the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Please pray earnestly for me, asking the Lord to lead and prepare a way that I would escape the hands of those who do not obey!</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Is Mr. Nee at home? I hope that he can also read this letter and pray for me!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Finally, brother, is there anything else I should pay attention to besides what was published in the last issue of The Present Testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I hope you can answer my letter immediately!</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you always!</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Liu Ai Wu</S>
