It is very important for a worker to know men. When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition; we have to know where his problem lies. If we do not know men or their spiritual condition, we will not be able to render them any help. A doctor needs many instruments to diagnose a patient. Even with many instruments, he sometimes cannot determine the illness of his patient. When a person comes to us, he may not tell us everything that is within him. A sinner often does not tell the truth, and believers often skip important things that we need to know. It is impossible to know men simply by their words. We cannot know a person simply by our ears or our eyes. Only those whose soul and spirit are separated and who are able to exercise their spirit can know men. This is a very basic principle in our work. We know men by the spirit, because the spirit discerns all things. We must learn to know others' spirit with our spirit. We must learn to sense their spirit with our spirit. We measure a person not by the words he speaks but by our spirit. We touch others' spirit with our spirit. This is what it means for deep to call unto deep and for deep to respond to deep.</p><p>In order for the senses in our spirit to be acute, the outer man must be broken. Every saved person should be inwardly clear about everything. If he is not clear, it is because his outer man has choked the way. We know a person's spirit by his words. As such, we have to touch the spirit behind a person's word. We do not know men just by our ears or eyes; we know their spirit with our spirit. However, their spirit follows their words. Hence, we have to touch the spirit behind the words. A proud person sooner or later will betray a proud spirit. He may say many humble things with his mouth, but others will touch his proud spirit sooner or later. What he says at the beginning is merely a kind of imitation or performance. His last few words determine his true condition. We have to touch others' spirit with our spirit. This is the only way to know their true condition.</p><h2 class="head3">Identifying Artificiality and Falsehood</h2><p>The only parts of man that can be improved are his thoughts and attitudes; a man cannot change his spirit. Young brothers should be as simple as possible; they should not be pretentious in any way. No pretense has any spiritual worth. Some young people are very flippant; others are very solemn. Both the flippant and the solemn ones are off the mark. There is a brother in Shanghai who was saved only a year ago, but he is neither flippant nor solemn. This is good. No outward embellishment will do us any good. If a man's spirit has learned the proper lessons before the Lord, others can tell the difference as soon as he opens his mouth. In order for a Christian to advance, he has to break down all outward, artificial humility, calmness, and godliness. He can deceive those in degraded Christianity, but he cannot deceive us. We should never pretend.</p><p>May the Lord have mercy on us. When God breaks us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit and purges our emotion and destroys our stubborn will through the environment, we will be built up spiritually. Then we will touch others' spirit and come to know other men. The problem with the young people is that they seek to build up their behavior instead of their spirituality. All outward things will be destroyed one day. It is possible to lie not only with our words but with our behavior as well. Job was upright in everything and eschewed evil. But he eventually repented of his own righteousness. Before the Lord we have to be genuine. We should not pretend or perform in any way.</p><p>First, we have to realize that we maintain God's presence by separating the outer man from the inner man. Second, through the separation of the outer man from the inner man, we also acquire a knowledge of men. We come to know men only after our outer man and inner man have been separated. We cannot know men with the outer man. Once our outer man is separated from our inner man, we are ready to listen to others and to touch their spirit. As a result, we will discern any falsehood in others. Anything artificial is false and deceptive.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
