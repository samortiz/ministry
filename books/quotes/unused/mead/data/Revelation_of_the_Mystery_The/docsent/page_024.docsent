   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POWER OF SURPASSING GREATNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 1:17-20 says, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all need to learn to eat these words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here Paul wants us to see the power of surpassing greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word power is a very particular word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The literal translation of the Greek word is dynamo.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A dynamo is a dynamic power, an exploding power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the power according to the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word operate, which also means "energize," is also a literal translation of the Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the might of His strength, God caused the power to be energized in Christ in raising Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ's being raised from the dead is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was raised not only from the tomb but also from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dead are in Hades, which has the power to hold the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 2:24 says, however, that it was not possible for Christ to be held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He broke forth from the imprisonment of death and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today this great power is also operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, this mighty power also seated Christ at God's right hand in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shows us Christ's ascendancy and transcendence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, He is far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know that gravity is a tremendously great force.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ in His resurrection and ascension overcame three layers of forces.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first layer Hades, the power of death is underneath the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second layer the force of gravity is on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third layer is the obstruction from the rulers and authorities in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus overcame Hades, the earth's gravity, and the rulers and authorities of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He ascended to the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How surpassing is the greatness of His power!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, God subjected all things under Christ's feet and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the great power that operated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah, this great power is also in us today!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 3:20 says, "But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's doing is not according to the power from heaven or according to the power from an outside source but according to the power that operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a dynamo in every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 16 says, "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word for power can also be translated dynamo.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is according to this power that God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every one of us has this power within us, like a generator running inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Unfortunately, instead of turning on the generator inside us, we often pay attention to the outward dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consequently, the power that should be operating in us is inoperative.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is it to exercise the spirit and to turn to our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to forget about everything outward and to turn on the generator.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we turn on the switch, the generator inside immediately starts to run.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must see that Christ in us has unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must also see that the all-inclusive Spirit in us is a dynamo.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not a matter of how we act outwardly, how we behave outwardly, or how we improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a matter of turning on the generator inside.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once the generator inside is turned on and starts running, it generates the power of surpassing greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This power is so great that there is no way to describe it other than to say, "What surpassing greatness!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This great power enabled Christ to overcome Hades, the force of gravity, and the evil authorities in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It enabled Christ to ascend to the highest place in the universe and then to enter into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What great power this is!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today this dynamo is in us.</S>
