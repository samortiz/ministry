   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEWARE OF AMBITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I wish to fellowship with you some further crucial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we should beware of several factors.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These factors are like wolves, roaring lions, and speeding cars on the street that can harm us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first factor is ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What I have written in the accompanying outline is according to my personal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not mean to say that only you have these negative points and I do not.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I also have experienced them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who does not have ambition?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Lord s work, the ambition is to be the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are among the co-workers, you may want to be the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you cannot be the first among them, you may still want to be the vice-president.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the sisters who have roommates want to be the leader among them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church you may want to be the elder, even the leading elder, the leader of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, your ambition may also be to get a place, even a district, for your work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who does not have such an ambition?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was with Brother Nee, and I learned of him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I never saw that he was ambitious to get a place, a certain district to be his district or little empire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A district in this sense is a little empire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may want to be an emperor in your district, with everything under your control and rule and where everyone must listen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who is not like this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was like this, but the Lord dealt with me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your ambition may also be to captivate people to be your private co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may attract, charm, and capture people for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that in your work in the Lord s recovery you have a party in which certain ones who are very close to you have been captivated, attracted, and charmed by you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They appreciate your ability, and they appreciate your capacity, so they stand with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then they become your particular co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are co-workers generally, but in particular they are a certain person s co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you not realize that there is such a situation in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have seen this in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Beginning in 1984 I called three urgent conferences of the co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In my opening word I pointed out that among us there is the tendency of division.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this I meant that quite a few capable co-workers in the Lord s recovery liked to keep their district as their empire, and they liked to attract people to be their particular co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are all co-workers generally, but some became particular co-workers with certain attracting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, I warned you all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After my speaking, one of the co-workers stood to confess that this was the case.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, at that time I realized that his confession was not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was very weak, and today he has become a problem in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He still claims that he is in the recovery, and he still takes the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He protests that his meeting is a local church, and he declares that he is one with Brother Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He accepts my ministry, and he receives standing orders of the books of the Living Stream Ministry even until today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Recently, he spoke to me for close to one hour to explain his stand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I told him I felt that it was not the Lord s timing to respond to him at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, after further consideration with the Lord, I felt that I had received a clear word and that it was the Lord s timing to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I felt to tell him, You are a division, and whatever you do in your place is a division because you cut your meeting off from all the churches in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moreover, you like to visit the rebellious ones and stand with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should realize that all the churches are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You cannot stand alone, separate from the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do, you are a division.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Corinth some said, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul condemned them for this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even if you say that you are of Christ, that is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is as if Paul said to them, Is Christ divided?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why do you say that you are of Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not be of me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am of you, and we all are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First Corinthians 1 shows us that there should not be any differences among us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No one is of Cephas, no one is of Apollos, no one is of Paul, the highest apostle, and no one is even of Christ separately from others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all are of Christ, who is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our fallen disposition by birth always likes to captivate people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If someone can do a work for the Lord, he may like to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He may like to charm them and captivate them, and if he succeeds in captivating others, the captivated ones become members of his little party.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the Lord s recovery there is the possibility of having such a party.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you have the opportunity and the time, you may do this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have not done this because you have not had the opportunity, the condition, and the situation, but when you do have the opportunity, you may do it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the first underground gopher that damages the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may have been damaged by this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Within you there may be this very strong hidden gopher.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I consider this as the first problem.</S>
