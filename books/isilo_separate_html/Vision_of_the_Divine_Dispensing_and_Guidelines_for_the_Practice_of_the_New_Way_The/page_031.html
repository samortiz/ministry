Those trainees who are presently in the training are also invited to attend, because in the future, they will also be taking the same way. Although I do not have an outline for you, I do have a definite burden to fellowship with you in a thorough way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO CONCEPT OF TITLE, RANK, OR POSITION</H2><P>The full course of our training is two years. The first year is for training here in the training center. The second year is for practice in the villages. The first thing I want you to know clearly is that among us, there is no title, rank, or position. On the one hand, the Bible tells us that through the grace received, some have the function of apostles. On the other hand, the Bible also shows us that we are all brothers. If anyone desires to be great, he has to be the servant of all (Matt. 20:26-27). This word annuls all concepts of title, rank, and position in the church. For this reason, there must never be any hierarchical concept with us.</P><P>Some may consider me to be an apostle. But who can tell? Even I myself cannot tell this. But I do know of the Lord's commission to me. I cannot deny what I can do and that I have a portion that others cannot replace. Among us during the past two or three years, there were some problems. Whether others exalt me or attack me, I have not been affected because I have been following the Lord. I will never do anything divisive, and I will never oppose anyone. But when it comes to the matter of the truth, I never give in. I will always stand for the truth. Every one of us as a saved one has our capacity, that is, our function or our gift, in the Body of Christ. Yet we do not have titles, ranks, or positions. It is true that in the church there are elders, and that the younger ones should submit to the older ones. However. this should not be a matter of position. Rather, it should be a matter of function.</P><P>For many years, I have felt uneasy about using the term co-workers for fear that this matter would develop into a special rank among us. If anyone has this concept, I would beg you to drop it. In the Body of Christ there are different members. There are the big members and the small members, the high members and the low members. However, this is not a matter of position but a matter of function. For example, the two eyebrows are higher than the two eyes. The difference in location is due to their difference in function. According to the Bible, everyone who belongs to the Lord is a member in the Body of the Lord and should therefore be a co-worker. All the members should do the same work of building up the Body of Christ. For this reason, we should not consider the term co-worker as a special title. However, it is all right to call someone a full-timer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING SPIRITUAL WARFARE AND<br>LEARNING SPIRITUAL LESSONS</H2><P>While I was away, I often received letters from you, and I have heard some news concerning you. According to my understanding, your evangelization work in the villages during the past year or so has not been without spiritual warfare. In some places, you fast twice a week to meet the need. This is surely right. Furthermore, in the experience of life you have definitely learned more spiritual lessons than you would have learned by being in a big church. But I would still say a word. The most precious thing in the church is the oneness. With oneness there is the blessing. Opinions will only bring in problems. You should not consider quitting the training as a solution, because this would betray your initial consecration of living to the Lord. You should take up the cross and accept all difficulties. Wipe away all tears and follow the Lord to go on.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
