God wants His priests to impart His word and His desire with Himself into His people and to bring them before Him to be united with Him
In the New Testament the type of the priests has been fulfilled, and the shadow of the priests has been realized
Concerning the priestly service there was a great turn from the Old Testament to the New Testament a turn which began with John the Baptist
Beginning with John the Baptist the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel is primarily to offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God
The work that is carried out by the New Testament priests of the gospel on sinners is complete with three major sections
We are regenerated in our spirit in an instant, but afterward we need to be transformed for a long period of time
Our whole being-spirit, soul, and body-will be filled and saturated with the Lord and mingled with the Lord within and without
The Epistle to the Romans, written by the apostle Paul, concerns the gospel of God, and it begins with sinners
Paul did not only speak in this way concerning the gospel of God; he also served as such a priest of the gospel
He was sent by God from one place to another to preach the gospel, and he offered the saved ones as sacrifices to God
He took care of the new believers in Christ that they might grow by the word of God and that thereby the fruits of the gospel would remain
Like him, they could do the work of the building of the Body of Christ , and they could all become the New Testament priests of the gospel
If we do the work of a priest frequently and regularly, we will surely be able to do it and will improve in the way we do it
Since we are priests of the gospel, we need to offer sacrifices to God, and what we offer to Him are saved sinners
According to the revelation of the Bible, this should be the ministry of the universal priesthood, not the priestly ministry of a few people
It is not that only a few saved ones with special gifts are priests and that the others the majority who are without gifts cannot be priests
In the Lord's recovery today what the Lord intends to recover in us is the universal priesthood, even the universal priesthood of the gospel
As such, everyone should preach the gospel directly to his family members, relatives, colleagues, schoolmates, and neighbors
We are all branches of the Lord as the vine ; as such, we need to bear fruit personally, not asking others to do it for us
The second step is to minister to the saved ones the grace of God that they may grow and offer themselves to God as living sacrifices
Rather, it is a work which every one of us as saved believers should do because we all are the New Testament priests of the gospel
He not only brings God's salvation to others but, much more, imparts to people the Christ of God as a living person
Through the gospel we help sinners to be regenerated and become the children of God, and then we nourish them in the Lord that they may grow
Of course, to be barren is not good, but to give birth to a troop and not be able to feed them is also not good
We need to preach the gospel to help people be saved that they may be regenerated, but much more, we need to nourish the newly saved ones
We should be those who express God, represent God, live out God, fellowship with God, draw near to God, and become one with God
We do not merely speak about Christ or God, but we express God, represent God, live out God, and bring God to others
As we experience Christ's salvation day by day and enjoy Christ's riches moment by moment, we are full of Christ within and without
By calling in this way, which can be compared to taking a deep breath, we receive the supply of life from the Lord
Having grown in life by being nourished and cared for, they also present themselves to God as living sacrifices
To nourish and take care of the new believers by meeting with them in their homes is the pattern revealed in the New Testament
In this message we want to see the third step in the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel-teaching and perfecting the saints
If a child is born but not fed, he will die prematurely, but if a child is fed after birth but not educated, he is still not perfected
As far as our physical, human life is concerned, we need begetting, nourishing, and teaching; as to our spiritual life, it is the same
Hebrew 102425 says Let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works not abandoning our own assembling together
The assembling together here is what we call a small group meeting, a meeting that is full of the nature of mutuality
Due to the negligence in care and teaching, hundreds of thousands of believers have fallen into a desolate condition
Strictly speaking, a big meeting is not our own meeting but the meeting of the minister; we attend his meeting to listen to his speaking
When we live such a life of praying and singing day by day, before it is time for the group meeting, we have already started it in our homes
When we come together, spontaneously we have something to say, and our prayers and singing are full of the Lord's presence
The primary emphasis of the small group meetings is to lead and cultivate the saints that they may open up and fellowship with one another
If they have any need or problem, they can honestly tell it to one another for mutual intercession in fellowship
They depend altogether upon the attendants who fellowship according to the practical situation by following the Spirit
In this kind of meeting, any question related to the Bible may be brought up for mutual answering that all may learn and teach the truth
In this way, everyone, whether older ones, younger ones, brothers, or sisters, can speak according to his own experience and realization
In this way we can all learn and teach together that we may pursue together and guide one another in the growth in life
When we come together, we should simply open up and fellowship with one another for mutual intercession, care, and feeding
After being perfected, every saint can do the work of the ministry, that is, the building up of the Body of Christ
In the previous messages we have seen the first three crucial steps of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel
When we preach the gospel to others, we should not ask them if they believe or whether or not they want to be saved
We must always be in spirit to lead them to believe, repent, and be saved, and we must lead them to call and pray with their spirit
Some people do not possess such skills, so when they speak the gospel to others, the more they speak, the more others do not believe
When we go to visit someone, instead of giving him 'a long face' we should be amiable and cheerful with a smiling face
We must be those who are released; our spirit is opened, our heart is rejoicing, and our mouth is full of praise
When we go to visit and nourish others, we must first pray until we get through and clear all the obstructions
We will be those who are released, without any burden, without any bondage, and without any sadness, but joyful and satisfied
Someone may come to the group meeting with his mouth sealed and his heart shut, and he may sit there with his entire being closed
In the prayer which the Lord taught the disciples, every clause and sentence is genuine and relevant, neither long nor verbose
In this way, not only do we give an answer to the one who asks the question, but we also render help to every attendant in the meeting
Now we come to the highest point of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel-prophesying for the building up of the church
According to the meaning in the original language, to prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God's word
Among the sixty-six chapters of Isaiah in the Old Testament, there are elements of prediction, but this book is not mainly predictions
Eventually we perfect them through teaching that they may also preach the gospel, nourish others, and teach others
Each time when we meet, we practice to speak with everyone speaking, and the more we speak, the more we are able to speak
In this way the function of every member can be manifested, and the riches of the Body of Christ can be released from every member
How can we change our meetings from one person speaking and everyone else listening to all speaking and listening mutually?
Ephesians 4 speaks of the perfecting of the saints, whereas 1 Corinthians 14 speaks of prophesying by all the saints
The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers should not only carry out their respective works
If we rely only on a few gifted evangelists to preach the gospel, then there will be too few who are able to preach
The result will be that a small number of people will become the evangelistic clergy, while the majority will become the laity
We have a wrong concept thinking that speaking for God and speaking forth God are such great matters that not every saint is able to do them
If only a group of clergy prophesies while all the others are the laity, then a religious hierarchy will be formed
The Bible was released from the chains of the Catholic Church in the 1500s and has been translated into many languages over the centuries
There are still many in the Protestant churches who cannot find the way to enter into the Bible when they read it
The Bible, which is a divine book of God's revelation, contains many special terms that are beyond the comprehension of ordinary people
In Acts 8 the Ethiopian eunuch sat in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah without understanding what it meant
At that moment Philip who was sent by the Spirit approached his chariot and asked him Do you really know the things that you are reading
In Luke 24:44-45 the Lord appeared to His disciples after His resurrection and opened their minds to understand the Scriptures
Their particular function is to explain God's scriptural revelation to His children and teach the holy word to every saint
The apostles perfect the saints to be apostles, to go out everywhere preaching the gospel and establishing churches
We see the apostles, prophets, and evangelists going out everywhere to do the work which they can do, while others are unable to do anything
The early disciples were able to carry out this work because the Lord Himself led them for three and a half years teaching them how to do it
In Acts we see the apostles announcing in Jerusalem the gospel of Jesus as the Christ and leading many people to the Lord
The fourth step is for all the saints to arrive at the point where everyone can prophesy, speaking for the Lord
Since they are New Testament priests of the gospel, their first step should be to preach the gospel to save sinners
If instead of exercising our legs by walking, we only lay in bed, then after a year we may not be able even to stand, much less walk
In the same way, all of us who are saved are members of the Body of Christ, and we all have our organic capacity to function
We must have the experience in the Lord, not only entering into the truth in depth but also having the experience of life
If we spend fifteen to twenty minutes doing this, we certainly will have some inspiration, which we should then write down
Eventually, when we combine our knowledge of the Bible, our experience of life, and our spiritual light, we can prophesy for the Lord
It is best if the brothers and sisters write out their prophecies and show them to some trainers for reviewing and correcting
We can change our meetings from having one person speaking with the rest listening to having everyone speaking and listening to one another
If the brothers and sisters are able to prophesy richly enough so that all the attendants are satisfied and fed, then that is sufficient
Otherwise, the leading brothers will still need to speak a word for eight to ten minutes at the end of the meeting
It should be a strong, rich, living message based upon the sharing of the brothers and sisters, and it should supply and satisfy everyone
Such a preparation is to fill up the lack in order to maintain and strengthen the prophesying meetings of the church
For such a glorious goal and result, there are requirements for the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel
In the outline of this message we have listed nine major points concerning the New Testament priests of the gospel and their living
Every morning we must go to the Lord to have a revival in order that our living will be like the light of dawn shining brighter and brighter
Of walking according to our opinions and reasonings, we walk according to the spirit , doing whatever the Spirit leads us to do
We do not teach anything different from the truth concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God
May all their paths be the paths of the righteous which are like the light of dawn shining brighter and brighter until the full day
O Lord, bless the Republic of Korea, bless this people, and bless this land for the sake of Your churches here
