   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE HEART FOR PRAYER I. THE POSITION OF THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible clearly shows us that man was created with three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The outermost part of man is the body; the innermost part is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Between these two is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have said that the spirit is composed of the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have also said that the soul is composed of the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Scriptures show us that there is another important organ in man the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The heart is composed of elements from both the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It includes one part of the spirit and all the parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The mind, emotion, and will of the soul, and the conscience of the spirit, each constitutes a part of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, speaking of the mind, Hebrews 4:12 says, "the thoughts of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The heart being capable of having thoughts clearly indicates that the mind, a part of the soul, is also a part of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hebrews 4:12 also speaks of the "intents of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While the thoughts are something of the mind, the intents are something of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus we can see plainly that both the mind and the will are parts of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, John 16:22 says, "your heart will rejoice" and 14:1 says, "Let not your heart be troubled."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since to rejoice and to be troubled are something of the emotion, the heart also includes the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, it is clear that the three parts of the soul are all constituents of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, Hebrews 10:22 says, "our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also, 1 John 3:20 mentions that our heart condemns us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Condemnation is a function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we know that the heart also includes the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In summary, the heart is composed of four parts: the mind, the will, the emotion, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The mind, will, and emotion are the elements of the soul, and the conscience is a major part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we were to realize the component parts of our heart, we would immediately be aware of its position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The position of the heart encompasses the mind, will, emotion, and conscience; it is a very broad position which includes all the parts of the soul plus a major part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the heart is the most comprehensive part in our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A TRUE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Speaking of the heart, the Bible pays attention first to its truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hebrews 10:22 tells us that the heart needs to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All those who come before God should have a true heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here, to be true means to be genuine and upright, not false or crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The heart of an insincere man is surely not true.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only so, to be true also means to be single-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a person comes before God to seek something in addition to God, he is double-minded, and his heart is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A true heart is real and not false, right and not bent, single and not double.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It desires only one thing God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When one comes to pray to God, he should only desire God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He should desire nothing outside God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He should only seek God's will and not anything that is outside His will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times when one comes to pray to God for a certain thing, he will ask God to show him His heart's desire, but he has his own desire also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a heart is false, doubting, and untrue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The heart needs to be single, seeking only God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is of foremost importance that the heart be true before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A PURE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Psalm 73:1 says, "Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A pure heart is more than just a clean heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a heart that simply wants God Himself and has no aim or goal other than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What they desire within is God Himself, so it follows that what they see is also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, speaking of a pure heart, the emphasis is not that the heart should be free from evil or defiled thoughts, but that it should want God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The heart singly and purely wants God Himself and His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Please remember, a heart that is not upright or single is an untrue heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But many times our heart seems to be true, yet it is impure because it still desires numerous things besides God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our heart appears to be true before men, yet it is still untrue in God's eyes because we are not pure and single within.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be true one needs to be pure, and to be pure one also needs to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the end we see that these two points show us that our heart should just want God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If it desires anything other than God, it has a problem concerning being single and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our heart remains two-sided and impure before God, we will have great difficulty in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, in order to learn how to pray, we must deal with the matter of the heart.</S>
