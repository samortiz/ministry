   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God wants to work to the extent that we are able.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham asked an old servant to bring back Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The servant had to bring her to Canaan, but the camel for the journey was prepared by Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Samaritan helped the robbed one on the way to Jericho ride on his beast and sent him to the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By ourselves we have no strength to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are damaged by our sin, and we can never have the strength to walk by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, God operates within us to cause us to will, work, and perform.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything that can fulfill God's good pleasure comes through His operation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He makes us to will and work for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will be on the right way if we can remember this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>D.M. Panton of England said once, "Whatever God can do, we can do also, since we have God abiding in us." When one sister died, there was a word about her on a sign which said, "She did what she could not do!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every day we live a life which we can hardly live.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we want to obtain full salvation, if we want our life to be clean and perfect, we need God's operation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many have tried to imitate Christ, but it can never be done.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is God who operates; consequently, we can work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every day we should hold on to the fact that it is not we, but God who operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can only do what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we see the Bible as a high standard, think that we should do all of these things, and try to do them, we will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should only ask God to operate until we are willing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mr. Panton told another story: There was a doctor who instructed a nurse to ask a patient to do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The nurse asked the patient to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the patient said that he could not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The nurse reported to the doctor what the patient had said, and the doctor then went to see the patient.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After an examination, the doctor said that it was not that he could not do it or was unwilling, but rather that he himself could not be willing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not willing inwardly and not able outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are inwardly unwilling to forsake the world, we will be outwardly unable to forsake the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, God is able to operate within us until we are truly willing and able to carry out His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since God has worked in us, we can work out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because God has operated within us, we can work out His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should pay special attention to carrying it out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whoever is a believer has Christ abiding in him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Corinthians 13:5b says, "Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are two common mistakes: one mistake is to think, "I want to do good, I hope to do good, and I hope to obtain a spiritual life."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second mistake is to think, "I am already saved, and there is no need for me to move a finger."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems as if Christ will make this one zealous without prayer, reading, or making any offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The former mistake is thinking that one can do good by himself; the latter mistake is thinking that one needs to do nothing after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a person is saved, he cannot have a spiritual living if he is not diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if he does not trust in God, he will not succeed either.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He must believe that God is operating within to enable him to will and work, which results in being able to pray, read the Bible, and testify.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Believing comes first, then the working out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The kingdom is taken by violence, and only violent men seize it Matt 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Day by day we have to diligently work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are not hopeless because God has operated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since we have received this operation, we will surely be able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us consider an example.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord taught His disciples, He said, "Take heed to yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him" Luke 17:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Right after this word, the disciples prayed, "Increase our faith."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The disciples knew they could not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is difficult enough to be sinned against once, twice, or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if someone sins against you seven times a day and repents seven times, it becomes rather annoying and hard to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, they asked the Lord to increase their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How did the Lord answer them?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you" v. 6 . How is this related to forgiveness? Because you have faith within, you are able to say to your hating heart, "Hatred, get away from me." Since you have such faith, when others ask you for forgiveness, you are able to say, "I forgive you." Since you believe that God has done it, you are able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Faith is needed not only in forgiveness, but also in reading the Bible, praying, and not loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you believe that God makes you able, you are able.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Philippians 2:14 says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The apostle told the believers that it was God who operates within them to will and work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The result of this kind of operation is peace with others without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Being without reasonings is having nothing doubtful or indecisive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Being without murmurings is being able to believe others and love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 13 tells us that God's life is operating within; as a result, in verse 14 there is complete peace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We see this not only in Philippians, but in similar examples in Ephesians and Colossians as well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After Ephesians 3:19, "That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" verses 20-21 are words of praise , 4:2-3 immediately says, "With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the inward operating of the power of God is manifested in a believer, the result is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Colossians 1:11 says, "Being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The might of His glory is God's great power.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We think that if we have the might of God's power, we can do marvelous things, perform miracles, and accomplish great things beyond understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Little do we realize that long-suffering and forbearance is the supreme expression of God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is more difficult to pray to God and ask for an answer than it is to be patient with a bothersome saint.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Long-suffering is hard, but God's power can enable us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All three Epistles speak about a Christian being able to have peace with others and being long-suffering and forbearing once he receives the operating and filling of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Philippians 2:15 says, "That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"Blameless" means that others have nothing to say against you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"Guileless" is being inwardly single and not double-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"Crooked" is not straight, while "perverted" means disjointed and unrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The word "generation" in this verse can be translated as "species" according to the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The main point of this verse is that a Christian is distinct in the midst of a species which is crooked and disjointed from the will of God; he is single and blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is like a light in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To "shine" is an expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Verse 16 says, "Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some believers think that it is not necessary to open their mouths to testify and that they only need to lead others by good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, this is only what quiet believers would say.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should bring forth the word of life; in other words, we should lift it up purposely so that others may see.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Not only do we need to testify by our lives, but by our mouths also.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Bible never tells us to testify only by life, without our mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Among our relatives, friends, and people we have contact with, we must open our mouths to testify; otherwise, we have not held forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is true that Matthew says, "You are the light of the world" 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, the Bible also tells us to confess the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you are able to believe, please believe that you are not only able to shine among those around you, but you are also able to testify to them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Paul meant that if you do this, you will be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"The day of Christ" is the day when Christ will reign.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>"Run in vain" refers to finding the sinners and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>"Labor" refers to serving the saints, shepherding them, and preaching to them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The apostle was indicating that if the Philippians would hold forth the word of life, he, in the day of Christ, would not have run in vain, neither labored in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Philippians 2:17 says, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice together with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the same as Romans 12:1 which says, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Paul meant that if the believers were able to present themselves to God, he was willing to even give up his life and die with them.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If they really presented themselves as gifts to God, he was willing to even give up his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Paul had rejoiced already.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, he also wanted them to rejoice with him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Philippians 2:18 says, "And in like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me."</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Verse 17 says that Paul had rejoiced already and that he would rejoice with them all.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In this verse he said that they should rejoice and rejoice with him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Oh, those who have God's power operating within them have nothing else but joy.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Brothers and sisters, we should believe in what God has done; then we will also be able.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Now all we need is to be willing.</S>
