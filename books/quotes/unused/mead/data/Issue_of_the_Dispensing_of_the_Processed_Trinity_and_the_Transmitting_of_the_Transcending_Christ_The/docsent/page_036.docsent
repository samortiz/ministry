   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>My burden is not to merely teach us the Bible but to present us a view so that we can really see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The view of the church over these many centuries has been made very dim.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who do not see anything at all say that the church is a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Brethren strongly pointed out that the church is not a physical building but the gathering of God's called-out ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is according to the denotation of the Greek word ekklesia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this still is not the intrinsic significance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The intrinsic significance of the church, from the entire New Testament, is that the church is God's total reproduction, God's continuation, God's increase, God's full growth, and God's rich surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all should declare, "We are the total reproduction of God!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are God's continuation!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are God's increase!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are God's full growth!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are God's rich surplus!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may be able to say that we are God's expression, but have we ever considered that we are God's continuation?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may wonder where I learned all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Years ago Brother Nee told me face to face that we, the church, are God's duplication, God's reproduction, and God's continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without us, God has no continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Nee also told me that we are God's increase and God's full growth, so we are God's surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a high vision of the church needs us to pray, "Lord, give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see and to know what Your church is."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may have heard that the church is the Body of Christ for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we still do not know the intrinsic denotation of this until we see that the church is God's reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is God's xerox copy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could the church be the reproduction of God, the continuation of God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How could the church be the full growth, increase, and surplus of God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church can be all these things by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity and by the heavenly transmitting of the transcending Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not say that the transmitting equals the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we can say that the transmitting comprises, includes, the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to be impressed that the transmitting is crucial but it is not as basic as dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father's dispensing, the Son's dispensing, and the Spirit's dispensing are very basic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By, through, and with this threefold, triune dispensing many regenerated sons of God are produced and transformed into a treasure, becoming the heritage to God as God's personal, private possession.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, the consummation of the processed Triune God as the compound, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit seals this heritage of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This sealing is not once for all but is still going on with its spreading effect to saturate and soak the regenerated sons and transformed treasures to make them God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But thus far, there has been only the producing of the materials, the components, the constituents, to constitute the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The materials are here, but the formation has not yet taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So there is the need of the transmitting of the transcending Christ from the heavens, in the heavens, and with the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church was formed by the transmitting of the transcending Christ from the heavens, in the heavens, and with the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a great thing.</S>
