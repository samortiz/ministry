   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Naturally, in such preaching, one relies on the message more than on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The entire heart of these believers depends on what they preach to move human hearts instead of on the Holy Spirit to reveal to men their need and the Lord's supply to fill up their lack.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What they emphasize and trust is their own speaking, which may be entirely the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, without the enlivening by the Holy Spirit, such truth is of no profit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To rely on the words instead of on the Holy Spirit produces very few spiritual results.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>People may welcome or accept such speaking, but it can only reach their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Soulish believers are fond of using sensational words in their preaching, whereas real spiritual believers can give very clear and lucid teaching which none may have ever conceived of before, because the Lord has given them much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Soulish believers like to imitate this in their work because imitating is one of their characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that only this kind of speaking will be fascinating to the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In preaching they like to use strange imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If some peculiar thoughts come upon them while walking, talking, eating, or sleeping, they will surely jot them down for future use, not questioning whether such thoughts are revealed in their spirit by the Holy Spirit and are experienced by them or are merely sudden thoughts which come to their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some soulish believers delight in helping others, but because they themselves have not reached the state of maturity, in helping others they do not know how to dispense food in due season.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not to say that they do not have knowledge; actually they have much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they see anything wrong in others or are told of some difficulty, they pretend to be experienced believers trying to help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based upon their limited insight and some ability of discernment which they have learned from more experienced believers, they speak fluently about biblical teachings and the experiences of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In helping others, soulish believers often tell all that they know and perhaps sometimes go beyond to tell what they do not know, which is merely their supposition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they are helping others, they always pour forth everything which has been stored in their mind and exhibit one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not ask at all whether this is the particular illness of this particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Or, is this the need of this one?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or, is this one able to suddenly take in so many teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are like Hezekiah who opened all his storehouses and showed all his treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes it is not that there is someone drawing them out to speak, but they are stirred suddenly by their emotion, and they pour out so many spiritual doctrines, perhaps many of which are merely ideals.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes such behavior is simply to show off their own knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this differs according to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some can be completely silent, not uttering a word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even when there is a tremendous need, when they should speak to help others, they keep their mouth tightly closed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are suppressed by their natural shyness and fear; therefore, they are not free.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They can sit beside those talkative believers and criticize them in their heart, but their tacitness is not in any way less soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because soulish believers have not been deeply rooted in God and have not learned how to be hidden in God, they are often visible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even when they are doing spiritual work, they always seek to occupy the conspicuous position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they attend a meeting, they do not expect to hear others but rather to be heard by others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are overjoyed when they are held in high esteem.</S>
