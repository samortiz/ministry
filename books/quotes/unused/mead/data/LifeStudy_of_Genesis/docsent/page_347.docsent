   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>f Making Isaac a Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This source of living water makes Isaac a burnt offering 22:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The source from which Ishmael drank made him an archer, one who lived wildly for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Isaac's source of living made him a burnt offering, one who was offered to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>g Leading to the Offering to God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>on the Mountain in Moriah</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This source of living led Isaac up to Moriah, not down to Egypt 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ishmael's source of living leads people downward, but Isaac's source leads people upward to the mountain in Moriah where Jerusalem was later built.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This going up to Moriah kept God's people from the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also need to go up from Beer-sheba to Jerusalem, not only having the church life at Beer-sheba but also in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ultimately, this proper source of life will make all of us Isaacs and will lead us to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we have another seed of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ishmael lived in the wilderness and was joined to Egypt, but Isaac lived in a planted place and was led to Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mountain in Moriah eventually became Mount Zion upon which God's temple was built 2 Chron 3:1 , thus becoming the center of the good land which God gave to Abraham and his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After his descendants followed the way of Ishmael and went down to Egypt, God brought them out of that land with the intention of bringing them into the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But their unbelief kept them wandering in the wilderness where Ishmael lived.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, God brought their children into the good land and chose Jerusalem, which was built on Mount Moriah, as the unique center for them to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result of this, all the children of Israel were brought, three times every year, to the very mountain in Moriah to which Isaac was brought.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, Isaac's being brought to Mount Moriah was a seed which was developed in the going up to Mount Zion of all the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Out of Abraham two kinds of people came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One is represented by Ishmael who lived in the wilderness and who was joined to Egypt; the other is represented by Isaac who lived at Beer-sheba and who was brought to Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today there are also two kinds of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One kind is like Ishmael, living for themselves in the wilderness of their soul and being joined to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The other kind is like Isaac, living for God in their spirit and in the church and being brought to Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even we, the real Christians, may be like Ishmael, living in and for ourselves and being joined to the world, unless, as typified by Isaac, we live in our spirit and in the church that we might reach God's goal.</S>
