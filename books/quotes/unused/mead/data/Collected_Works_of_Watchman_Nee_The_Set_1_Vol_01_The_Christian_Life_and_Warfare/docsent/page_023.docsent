   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus wants us to hate our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should hate our own life and should not allow it to have the opportunity to act freely with respect to human love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were those who simply loved whomever we loved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the Lord wants us to take up the cross and to hate what we love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's demand and our own intention are diametrically opposed to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those whom we formerly loved we must now hate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not only hate what we loved, but must hate the loving organ, which is our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is truly a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we will truly take up the cross in this way, we will afford our High Priest the opportunity to divide our soul from our spirit in the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then everything soulish will no longer control or affect the spirit, and we will love others in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the same way that the Lord Jesus loved His own household while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 16:24 and 25 the Lord Jesus again mentions the relationship between the soul-life and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." In these verses, our Lord is calling His saints to come once more beneath the cross and to commit their soul-life to it, so that they would lose their soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Superficially, what is mentioned here is the same as what is mentioned in Matthew 10.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in Matthew 10 the emphasis is on the part of the soul-life which pertains to love, while in chapter sixteen the emphasis is on the part of the soul-life that pertains to man's "self."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we read the previous verses, we will see that the Lord Jesus was telling the disciples of His coming suffering at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter, in an earnest love for the Lord, told Him, "God be merciful to You, Lord" v. 22 . He cared for man's will and was not willing to see his teacher suffer in His flesh the pain of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not understand that a man must first care for God's will, even at the expense of death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not know that one's love for God's will should far exceed his love for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was as if he were saying, "Lord, if You die on the cross, You may have kept God's will and accomplished God's goal, and You may have acted according to God's plan, but what will happen to You?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are You not going to consider the suffering that You will face in keeping God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, be merciful to Yourself!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's answer to him reveals that such a thought of pitying oneself is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then He seems to tell the disciples, "Not only will I have to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even you who are following Me and who desire to be My disciples must also go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As My way is, so shall your ways be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not misunderstand that I am the only One who has to keep God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You who are My disciples must keep God's will as I do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As I have not cared for Myself but have unconditionally kept God's will even to the place of the cross, in the same way you must not care for your own soul-life but must be willing to give it up and to do what God wants you to do."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter told the Lord to "be merciful" to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord's answer to Peter is that he should "deny himself."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a price to pay in keeping God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The flesh cannot help but tremble at this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the soul-life takes a firm rule in us, we are not able to rejoice in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we hear God calling us to the cross, calling us to deny ourselves, to sacrifice, and to lose everything for His sake, our soul-life unconsciously responds with self-pity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The soul-life makes us unwilling to pay the price and to submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every time we consciously choose the narrow way of the cross and choose to suffer for Christ's sake, the soul-life takes a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is through this that we lose our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only by this, can we have the spiritual life of Christ reigning in us in a full and pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way we will be able to perform a work that is acceptable to God and a benefit to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we consider the previous verses, we will understand even further the evil of the work of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter spoke this word right after he had received God's revelation, understanding the mystery that cannot be understood by man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Father revealed directly to Peter that the humble Jesus he followed was the Christ of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But after he received such a revelation, he was immediately overcome by his soul-life; he exhorted his teacher to be merciful to Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we must realize that supernatural revelations and wonderful knowledge cannot keep us from being overcome by the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, the higher the knowledge and the more supernatural the experiences, the more hidden is the soul-life and the harder it is to remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it is not dealt with by the cross, the soul-life will continue to remain in man and will never go away.</S>
