   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 12:4 Paul goes on to say, But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But here indicates a contrast between verses 3 and 4.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 3 says when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say Lord Jesus, exalting Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the gifts for the manifestation of the Spirit are diverse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered distributions in this verse, as well as in verses 5 and 6, means diversities, varieties, distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The gifts in verse 4 refer to the outward gifts, the ability or enablement for service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some of them are miraculous, and some are developed out of the initial gifts mentioned in 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1:7 gift refers to the inward gifts issuing from grace, such as the free gift of eternal life Rom 6:23 and the gift of the Holy Spirit Acts 2:38 as the heavenly gift Heb 6:4 , not the outward, miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the gifts in chapter twelve are different from the initial gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 5 continues, And there are distributions of ministries, and the same Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These ministries are services.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gifts in verse 4 are for these services and they are for the operations in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 6 Paul says, And there are distributions of operations, but the same God, who is operating all things in all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These operations are works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ministries or services in verse 5 are for these works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE OPERATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IN OUR SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 12:4-6 the gifts are by the Spirit; the ministries, the services, are for the Lord; and the operations are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here the Triune God is involved in these three things gifts, ministries, and operations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries, the services, for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ministries for the Lord are to accomplish the operations, the works, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have emphasized the fact that the gifts in chapter twelve are much related to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we speak, the Spirit works.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may think that we are the ones functioning in speaking; actually the Spirit is the one who functions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers, and God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our speaking, therefore, is of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not speak, the Spirit does not function, the Lord does not minister, and God does not operate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a very real sense, the Triune God is waiting for us to speak something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit desires to function, the Lord wants to minister, and God intends to operate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this depends on our exercising our spirit in speaking forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our speaking is crucial to God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not speak, if we are silent or dumb, the Triune God will be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the more we speak by exercising our spirit, the more the Spirit will function, the Lord will minister, and God will operate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we speak, the Spirit functions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord ministers, God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the functioning, ministering, and operating of the Triune God depend on our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both in the meetings and in our practical, daily living, the Triune God responds to our speaking in our spirit by functioning, ministering, and operating.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us suppose that a brother, his wife, and his children are having fellowship during a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As they all speak, the Spirit comes forth to function.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the Lord follows to minister, and God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many of us can testify of having this kind of experience in our daily life as well as in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we desire to have more of this kind of experience, we need to learn to stop gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we engage in gossip or vain talk, we shall not experience the operation of the Triune God in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to speak Christ, grace, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the Spirit is joined to our regenerated human spirit, whenever we speak these wonderful matters, the Spirit will function.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Following the function of the Spirit, the Lord, who is one with the Spirit, will minister.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Lord ministers, God the Father operates.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the operation of the Triune God in our speaking in the Spirit.</S>
