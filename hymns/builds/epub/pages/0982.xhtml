<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>1</b> How true it is no heart may comprehend</div>
<div class='line'>The glory God prepareth for His own,</div>
<div class='line'>And what will happen when this age shall end;</div>
<div class='line'>But yet in vision Jesus hath made known</div>
<div class='line'>How fair and holy shall the Church descend,</div>
<div class='line'>Lit up with light of precious jasper stone.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> And He shall make His Church all heavenly fair,</div>
<div class='line'>With gold and pearls, and every radiant stone,</div>
<div class='line'>And reign in holiness and glory there,</div>
<div class='line'>And shine as suns and stars have never shone;</div>
<div class='line'>And He shall lead His Bride, His joy and care,</div>
<div class='line'>With blissful singing to His Father's throne.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> And then the blest communion shall have come,</div>
<div class='line'>Of God's dear children meeting from afar;</div>
<div class='line'>Within His burning love they blend as one,</div>
<div class='line'>Yet each, according as His counsels are,</div>
<div class='line'>Shall have peculiar glory of his own,</div>
<div class='line'>As one star differeth from another star.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> And God is all in all in that great day,</div>
<div class='line'>And He is their exceeding great Reward;</div>
<div class='line'>Their stream of life, their beautiful array,</div>
<div class='line'>Their food, their joy, their radiance, Christ the Lord;</div>
<div class='line'>The music of their wondrous song shall say,</div>
<div class='line'>How great the joy that passeth thought or word.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> And this is that eternal life of heaven,</div>
<div class='line'>Laid up with Christ in God, the mystery</div>
<div class='line'>Of resurrection life which He hath given:</div>
<div class='line'>A fount of living waters full and free;</div>
<div class='line'>A life by which the gates of death are riven,</div>
<div class='line'>A life which on the throne of Christ shall be.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> And here in this waste wilderness begun,</div>
<div class='line'>So soon as we believe in Christ aright,</div>
<div class='line'>And quickened by the Spirit of the Son,</div>
<div class='line'>Receive Him as our only life and light,</div>
<div class='line'>As all the branches in the vine are one,</div>
<div class='line'>So we are one forever in His sight.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>7</b> Now come, Lord Jesus, quickly from above,</div>
<div class='line'>Do Thou sustain us on the desert road,</div>
<div class='line'>And draw us after Thee by might of love,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Fatherland art Thou, O love of God;</div>
<div class='line'>Once safe in Thee, no more shall we remove,</div>
<div class='line'>O Thou our everlasting sure abode.</div>
