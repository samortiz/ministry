With these three things as our basis, we shall obey God. We shall listen to Him, receive His word, go along with Him, and desire to be one with Him.<p>Seeing the vision of the processed Triune God with His work and the result of His work will constitute us into obedient ones. We will say, &#8220;Amen, Lord. I love You, I love Your work, and I love the result of Your work. In this result I am one with You, and You are one with me. You are working Yourself into me, and I am being constituted with You. Lord, obeying You is not hard or harsh but sweet and enjoyable. I like to enjoy all that You are, to enjoy Your work, and to enjoy the result of Your work. Lord, here I am in the enjoyment of Yourself, of Your work, and of the church life!&#8221; Surely, if we see such a vision and have such an enjoyment, we shall be fully satisfied, and it will be easy for us to give up the world and obey God.<h2 class=head2>Receiving God&#8217;s Blessing</h2><p>If we obey God, we shall receive His blessing. According to Leviticus 26:3-13, this blessing has six issues. The first of these issues is the rain, which signifies the Spirit. The second issue is the food of the land for our satisfaction, which signifies dwelling in Christ as our good land and enjoying the riches of Christ for our satisfaction and security. The third issue is the peace given in the land, which signifies a peaceful life in the church. The fourth issue is chasing the enemies, with five chasing a hundred and a hundred chasing ten thousand, which signifies the church chasing the enemies in the coordination of the Body. Once we were individuals, but now we are a corporate Body. The fifth issue is fruitfulness in multiplication, which signifies the church being fruitful and multiplying. The sixth issue is God&#8217;s dwelling place being among the people, which signifies that God&#8217;s dwelling place will be built up in the church for God&#8217;s delight that He may dwell among His people. To be God&#8217;s dwelling place is a great blessing, even the consummate blessing. If we obey God, we shall enjoy His blessing with these six issues.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_219.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_221.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Leviticus &nbsp; pg 220</div><br></body></html>
