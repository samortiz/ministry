The gospel demands not only that we preach it, but that we live it. The gospel must not only be heard, but must also be seen. No preaching can match the act of a martyr. More people are gained through an act of martyrdom than through the work of preaching.</P><P>There was a sister who was nineteen or twenty years old. For the Lord's sake, she was banished to Siberia. On her way in the train, she comforted her family and said to them, "Do not cry for me. Cry instead for those who do not have God. What I have far exceeds what they have. I am happy to suffer for the sake of my beloved Lord. The suffering that I endure can never match that of my Lord." A young thirteen-year-old boy sitting close by heard this word, and he was greatly moved to believe in the Lord. Later, he became one of the great workers used by the Lord in southern Czarist Russia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for Impact in the Gospel</H2><P>Strictly speaking, we need men of Acts 2 before we can have messages of Acts 2. What we have to do today is not simply to preach, but to have an impact on others. If we preach the gospel in this way, a fleshly man will not even be able to come into the church, let alone to go on afterwards. If there are such men and there are those who live this kind of life, corporately there will be the impact and the influence, and others will catch on to the warmth and the joy. Life is a matter of consciousness and feeling. With some people, you can only shake their hands; you cannot touch their spirit or their real person. If what a person has are the things of God, what others will sense in him will only be the things of God. If what a person has is the life of God, what others will sense in him will be life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MINISTRY BEING A MATTER<br>OF THE INWARD BURDEN</H2><P>All proper ministers are burdened with a message. If a man has a ministry, he will always be burdened with a few strong words that always remain with him. These few words become his burden. Sometimes the burden may appear very small, but the more the person explains it, the more words there will be. It is like a woolen yarn; the more you pull it, the more yarn you see. Any ministry that is of any worth is a ministry with a burden. Within that ministry, there is a specific burden.</P><P>With some people, all the time they are preaching on the podium, their minds are spinning. With some others, all that comes out of them is empty words. When others listen to the words, they do not receive any Spirit; all that they receive is the sounds. All real ministries have a burden within their words. The ones speaking may come feeling heavy, but they should leave feeling light. When they speak, they speak with a burden from within. If a man does not have a burden, any preaching he conducts with his mind and thoughts will be useless. A ministry must have a ministry's burden. The greatest suffering is for a person to come with something but to find no one to pick up his words. In the end, he carries back the same burden that he brings with him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE MOVE<br>OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><P>The problem of the move of the local churches must be solved in the Body. It is useless to try to solve it separately. The Lord must first have a way among us. Only when He has a way among us will He have a way among the churches. If He does not get through with us, He will not be able to solve the problems separately in the different localities.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_123.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_125.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 124</div><br></body></html>
