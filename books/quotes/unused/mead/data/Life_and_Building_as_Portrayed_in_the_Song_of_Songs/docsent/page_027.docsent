   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPRECIATION AND ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord today is going to recover His living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Song of Songs, we see one who sought the Lord, and by her seeking, she found Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Having found Him, she began to have sweet fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of this is in the first two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In her fellowship, first of all, the seeking one had a real appreciation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She appreciated the Lord as a bundle of myrrh within and as a cluster of henna flowers without.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She sought the Lord, she found the Lord, and in her fellowship with the Lord, she began to appreciate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Following this appreciation, there was the enjoyment she said that her beloved was like an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An apple tree is not only for appreciation, but also for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First of all, she had the appreciation, and then she came into the enjoyment of eating the fruit of the apple tree under its shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She enjoyed both the fruit and the shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After this, she was brought into the banqueting house, which means the house of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For her enjoyment, she had something to eat and something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By enjoying the Lord, she began to partake of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A PERMEATING WORK</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we eat anything, it becomes a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever we eat enters into us; it is digested and assimilated into our blood stream.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then it becomes our cells and even our organic tissues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose you eat some chicken for lunch.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By your eating of the chicken, it gets into you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is digested and assimilated to become cells in your blood; these cells then become your organic tissue and even your very element.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It just becomes you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we appreciate and enjoy the Lord, something of the element of the Lord is taken into us and eventually becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life he that eateth me, even he shall live by me" John 6:35, 57b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To enjoy the Lord is to eat the Lord, which means that we take something of the Lord into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then, there will not only be the appreciation and the enjoyment, but also the perfuming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be perfumed means to be permeated with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we must appreciate the Lord and begin to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By enjoying Him, something of the Lord will get into us to permeate us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This inworking of Jesus is the working of Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually we will be mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is recovering His living Person to us that He may be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This living Person is nothing less than God Himself in incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of these elements are included in His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a Person is going to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is not just for our appreciation and enjoyment; He must be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, when the question is asked, "Who is this?" the answer will be that this is Solomon with the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We eventually become one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>DEALING WITH EMOTION, MIND, AND WILL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To perfume or permeate any object without any life or personality is quite easy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A ball of cotton put into a bottle of red ink will soon be permeated with the red ink.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But suppose someone tries to put you as a living person into red ink.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Surely you will fight against it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why the Lord has a hard time trying to permeate us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have our own personality, our own will, and we do not want to lose them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we see in this book that the Lord first touched the emotions of the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Let Him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Draw me, we will run after thee."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord touched her emotions, and she began to love Him, even though she was as strong as horses.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then, as she came into the presence of the Lord and began to appreciate the Lord's sweetness and beauty, she was transformed by the renewing of her mind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Her perceptions and her concepts were changed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord first touched her emotions; then He renewed her mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She still had a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Her emotions were touched, and her mind had been transformed, but her will was still strong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It took a much longer time for the Lord to deal with her will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But eventually her will became the locks as a flock of goats feeding on Mount Gilead.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was the complete subduing of her will by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then, in resurrection, her will became as strong as the tower of David to be the arsenal for God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was by dealing with the emotion, the mind, and the will, that the Lord was able to work Himself into His seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we take this merely as a teaching, it will mean nothing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By His mercy we must realize that the Lord is speaking to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must begin to love Him with our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we will seek Him, find Him, and have sweet fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the fellowship we will have the appreciation and the enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then, something of the Lord will get into us to permeate us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This permeating work will transform us and subdue our will.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we will be willing to let the Lord do whatever He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He will put us into the "red ink," and we will be permeated and perfumed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We will be saturated until we have lost our character, our personality, and our will in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then we will really have Him as our Person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A horse has an exceedingly strong personality, but the palanquin does not have any personality of its own, though it does have a personality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Its personality is just the living Person it carries.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why the Lord Jesus wants to work Himself into us to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>NO SELF EFFORT</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After reading these things, we must not try to work them out ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should not attempt to change our mind or subdue our will.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We simply cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is only one way to change our mind: by appreciating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more we appreciate Him, the more our concept will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Formerly the movies and all the worldly things seemed attractive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Though they have not changed, yet we simply are not attracted to them any more.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They have not changed, but we have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our concepts have been changed by our appreciation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The sweetness and beauty of Jesus have changed our insight.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The more we appreciate Him, the more our mind will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>From appreciating the Lord, we must go on to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The more we take Him in, the more He will be the permeating element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In Him is the myrrh, the frankincense, the cleft of the rock, and the secret of the steep places.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All these elements are in His Person, and they will be wrought into us until we are transformed and our stubborn will is subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The more we feed upon Him and take Him in, the more He will saturate us until our will is completely subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is why the Lord appraised her hair as a flock of goats "that lie along the side of mount Gilead."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Gilead is a place for feeding the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>"Feed thy people the flock of thine heritage let them feed in Gilead, as in the days of old" Micah 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>"And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied in Gilead" Jer 50:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>There is no other way that our will can be subdued except by feeding on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must not try to subdue our will by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We must simply learn to feed upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must pray-read His Word in a living way, and we must tell Him, "O Lord Jesus, I love You!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I take Your very element into me.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I feed upon You as the living Word."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we will do this, spontaneously the Lord will permeate our being and subdue our will.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Our emotion will be touched, our mind will be transformed, and our will subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Then, the Lord will have full freedom to saturate us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We will no longer be a horse, but a palanquin and a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When anyone asks concerning us, the answer will be that we are simply Christ with the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We have been wrought into Jesus, and He has been wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We are fully one with Him for His move on the earth.</S>
