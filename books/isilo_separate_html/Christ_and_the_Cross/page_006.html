<p>Although all things of creation express Christ, they do not represent Christ fully. Consequently, God made man to be Christ&rsquo;s explicit representative by creating man in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26). Christ is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4). Therefore, man was made according to Christ. Created man is a type of Christ in order to fully represent Christ (Rom. 5:14).</p>
<p>Many know only that Christ came in the likeness of men and was found in fashion as a man when He was incarnated (Phil. 2:7-8). But we must realize that man was created according to the image of Christ. Before Christ took on human form in His incarnation, man was created according to His image. Thus, created man had His image, and created man was in His image. Nevertheless, man did not have His life. Christ was incarnated in the humanity that was created according to His image so that man might have His life. This is like a sculptor who makes a wax figure according to his own image. Although the wax figure has his image, it does not have his life. If the sculptor could become a wax figure and take on the form of the wax figure and bring his life into the wax figure, would he resemble the wax figure, or would the wax figure resemble him? Surely we would say that the wax figure resembles the sculptor because the wax figure now has both the image and the life of the sculptor. Similarly, before Christ was incarnated and took on the form of man, the man whom He created according to His own image already had His image but not His life. Although man could not express Christ&rsquo;s life, man could represent Him according to His image.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL CREATED THINGS COHERING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God not only made Christ the Creator of all things but also the Upholder of all things. All things were not only created in Christ; they cohere in Christ. Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;All things cohere in Him,&rdquo; meaning that all things subsist in Christ as the holding center. All things subsist as a regulated, orderly, and harmonious system because of Christ. They are upheld by the power of Christ. Christ upholds and bears all things by the word of His power (Heb. 1:3). All things are regulated and maintained in order by Christ. When we see the subsistence of all things, we should see the Christ who is upholding all things.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the existence of all things expresses the power of God. The Bible further shows that all things exist for the expression of Christ. God delights in all aspects of all things expressing Christ. Consequently, He uses the creation of all things to express Christ and the existence of all things to express Christ. Nevertheless, it is possible to look at the existence of a multitude of things and have a sense of God&rsquo;s wondrous might but not have a sense of Christ. It is natural to look at the things that have been made and have a sense of God&rsquo;s wondrous might, but it requires revelation to look at the things that have been made and have a sense of Christ. Those who look at the wonderful things in nature can praise God for His might, but those who look at the wonderful things in nature with revelation can sense the power of Christ and admire Him. If we have revelation and are in the light of revelation, we will see that all things exist today in order to express Christ and His power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL CREATION BEING CREATED FOR CHRIST<br />
AND BEING INHERITED BY CHRIST</h2>
<p>God appointed Christ to be Heir of all things (v. 2), and God has given all into Christ&rsquo;s hand (John 3:35). All things were created through Him and unto Him (Col. 1:16), and all things cohere in Him (v. 17). Eventually, all things will be inherited by Him. He created, upholds, and will inherit all things. All things are out from Him and through Him and to Him (Rom. 11:36). In the past Christ was the source of all things, today Christ is the course of all things, and in the future Christ will be the end of all things. The source, the course, and the end, that is, the beginning, the course, and the consummation, of all things are Christ. Christ is everything to all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING ALL IN GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<p>Christ is both the Creator and a creature. Christ is both the wisdom of God&rsquo;s creation and the power of God&rsquo;s creation; Christ is both the means of God&rsquo;s creation and the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation. Christ is both expressed by all creation and represented by man among creation. The beginning and end of creation are Christ, and the course of creation is also Christ. The beginning of creation involves His creating, the course of creation involves His upholding, and the consummation of creation involves His inheriting. Creation is out from Him, through Him, and unto Him. If we look at creation in the past, we will see Him; if we look at creation in the present, we will see Him; and if we look at creation in the future, we will still see Him. From beginning to end, creation is a story of Christ. In God&rsquo;s creation every detail and every aspect are Christ. God takes Christ as the center of creation and the purpose of creation; therefore, in God&rsquo;s creation Christ is everything.</p>
<p>We must never think that Christ is related only to God&rsquo;s redemption but not to God&rsquo;s creation, that He participated only in God&rsquo;s redemption but not in God&rsquo;s creation. Christ is in God&rsquo;s redemption as well as God&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s creation. We should see Christ in every detail and aspect of God&rsquo;s creation, because Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s creation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
