<p>We should not think that we need to care only for the spirit but not for the ground. There are two sides to every matter, including the church. With the church, the ground speaks of the outward testimony, whereas the spirit speaks of the inner content. Although we cannot neglect the inner content by caring only for the ground, neither should we disregard the ground and care only for the spirit. We must care for both aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Refusing to Accept the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>In order to see the importance of the ground, I would like to give a testimony. In 1957 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan a second time. During this time there was a great contention because a brother among us raised a question concerning the ground of the church. In 1938 Brother Nee went to England and stayed with Brother Sparks for a period of time. After Brother Nee returned in 1939, he told me that the principles of spiritual life that we had seen would resonate only with Brother Sparks and the group who was with him. He also said, however, that they were unwilling to accept many of the matters that the Lord had shown us concerning the practice of the church.</p>
<p>When Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan in 1957, I knew that he was not open to the matter of the ground of the church. However, we still invited him to come in the hope that we could receive some spiritual help based on his spiritual portion. We had no desire to contend with him over the matter of the ground. Nevertheless, he said to me, &ldquo;When I saw something the first time I came, I was determined not to say anything at that time.&rdquo; This showed that he had an intention to say something the second time that he came. Then, when a brother raised a question concerning the ground with him, there was a contention.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Desiring to Establish Ministry Centers in Various Places</h2>
<p>As soon as the contention began, I realized that he had no thought of establishing local churches. Instead, he desired to establish ministry centers in various places on the earth. He once told me that he was willing to move to Taiwan, indicating his desire to establish a ministry center in Taipei. In addition, he also wanted to establish ministry centers in Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Singapore. He felt that he could help people by flying to and ministering in places such as New York, Taiwan, and Hong Kong at various times of the year. All those who were helped by his ministry could then spread his ministry among various denominations. Then those who were gained from the denominations would gather together with him during his next visit. This was his strategy.</p>
<p>This strategy, however, cannot work. First, those who were helped by him would be scattered in various denominations doing an underground work. They would not meet regularly together, and they would be dependent upon the limited supply rendered during his conference in their city. This alone would doom the work to failure. Second, the denominations would have a negative feeling toward Brother T. Austin-Sparks, and they would refuse to let some do an underground work in their midst. Various denominations even stated that those who were already doing an underground work would have to leave because they were not like-minded with those in the denomination. Hence, it was not possible for this strategy to ever work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Visiting Brother Sparks</h2>
<p>Brother Sparks&rsquo;s second visit to Taiwan caused a great contention, and it was clear that he did not care for the matter of the ground of the church. When I accompanied him to Hong Kong during his second visit, he invited me several times to come to England, but I did not accept. In 1958 I still had some hope that the brothers among us who had been affected by Brother Sparks would turn. Therefore, I felt that I should go to England, to the place of his ministry, and see the situation of his work. Before I even went, however, those who had been affected by Brother Sparks had already determined to oppose me if my response, upon returning from England, was not positive.</p>
<p>When I came to T. Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s place, I openly told him that I did not come to England with an intention of doing any work but to have a good fellowship with him concerning the Lord&rsquo;s interest on the earth today and the Lord&rsquo;s work. He then took me from London to Scotland for a week. We did not have meetings while I was there; we only fellowshipped over this matter. We talked every day, twice a day. We were polite in our fellowship, with both being somewhat advanced in age. He had his British diplomacy, and I had my Chinese etiquette, but when we sat down to talk, we had substantial fellowship.</p>
<p>One morning as we were sitting outside and before I began to speak, he said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, when I departed from Taipei to Hong Kong in April 1957, the flow within me stopped as soon as my plane took off, and it has not been restored even to this day.&rdquo; He was sincere, and he spoke clearly concerning his actual inner condition. Then he said, &ldquo;I rose up very early this morning to cry out to the Lord in His presence, asking Him why He has not restored the flow. After I prayed, I felt that I needed a little change.&rdquo; I was disappointed because he spoke only of a need for a change by moving to another place. I responded, saying, &ldquo;Brother, I also feel that you need a change, but you do not need a change in place.&rdquo; When he heard this, being an intelligent person, he knew what I was going to say next, which was that he needed a change in his concept related to the ground of the church. He was unable to receive what I said, however, no matter how I tried.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
