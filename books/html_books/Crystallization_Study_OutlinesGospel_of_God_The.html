<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Most Christians have a limited, superficial, and mistaken view concerning the gospel, and they preach a gospel that is low and superficial; this should not be the situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;John 3:16; 8:32; 14:6; 17:17; 18:37; Eph. 3:8; 1 Tim. 2:4.</li>
<li>The gospel is &ldquo;veiled in those who are perishing&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In principle, anything such as philosophy, religion, or cultural traditions that hinders people from apprehending the gospel of Christ is a veil&mdash;3:14-15.</li>
	<li>On Mount Zion God &ldquo;will swallow up / The covering that covers up all the peoples, / Even the veil that veils all the nations&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 25:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Today the people on earth are covered with a veil that keeps them from seeing God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;2 Cor. 3:15; 4:3-4; 1 Tim. 1:4.</li>
		<li>In the restoration God will take away this covering; then all the people will see something concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Eph. 3:9; 2 Cor. 3:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel of God is the totality of the divine truths&mdash;Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The truth is the gospel, and our preaching of the truth is the preaching of the gospel&mdash;Eph. 1:13; 1 Tim. 2:4, 7.</li>
	<li>The gospel of God includes all the divine truths; the expression <em>the divine truths</em> refers to the New Testament economy of God, which is the gospel&mdash;Gal. 2:5, 14; Eph. 3:9; 6:19.</li>
	<li>The entire New Testament is the gospel; because the New Testament as the gospel is typified by the Old Testament, we may say that the gospel actually includes the entire Bible&mdash;Luke 24:27, 44-45; John 5:39, 46.</li>
	<li>The gospel includes all the truths in the Bible; the entire Bible is the gospel of God&mdash;Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5; 1 Thes. 1:5; 2 Thes. 2:13-14; 1 Tim. 2:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The truth is the gospel, and the light of the truth is the light of the gospel&mdash;Mark 1:1, 14-15; John 8:12, 32.</li>
		<li>To preach the truth is to preach the high gospel, because the real gospel preaching is the speaking of the truth&mdash;Mark 1:14-15; John 18:37.</li>
		<li>If we would spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, we must bear the burden to diligently study the truth to the extent that we can expound the truth and announce the truth&mdash;2 Tim. 2:15; 1 Thes. 2:4; Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel of God is the fulfillment of the Old Testament&mdash;1:1, 14-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to know what the gospel is, we need to read the Old Testament and be enlightened concerning the revelation that is given there&mdash;Luke 24:44-46.</li>
	<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and the removal of the law; this is the full definition of the gospel&mdash;Matt. 17:2-8:

			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the promise that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent&mdash;Gen. 3:15.</li>

			<li>Christ was the One begotten as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Psa. 2:7.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the types, such as:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s action in making coats of skin for Adam and his wife is a type&mdash;Gen. 3:21.</li>
			<li>Other types include the ark (7:13), the passover (Exo. 12:3-13), the manna (16:31), the cleft rock (17:6), the tabernacle (25:9), Joshua (Josh. 1:1-2), David (1 Sam. 16:13), and Solomon (1 Kings 6:1).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The gospel is the removal of the law&mdash;Rom. 10:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The gospel annuls the custody of the law&mdash;Gal. 3:23-26; John 10:1-9.</li>
			<li>For Christ to be &ldquo;the end of the law&rdquo; means that He has completed and terminated the law&mdash;Rom. 10:4:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Christ came to fulfill the law; by fulfilling the law He terminated the law&mdash;Matt. 5:17.</li>
				<li>2) The result of Christ&rsquo;s terminating the law is that God&rsquo;s righteousness is given to everyone who believes&mdash;Rom. 3:21-26.</li>
				</ol></li>

		</ol></li>

		<li>The proclamation of Jesus Christ is according to &ldquo;the revelation of the mystery&rdquo;; this mystery is mainly of two aspects&mdash;Rom. 16:25:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The mystery of God is Christ, who is in the believers as their life and everything for His Body&mdash;Col. 2:2; 1:26-27; 3:4-11; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
			<li>The mystery of Christ is the church as His Body to express His fullness&mdash;Eph. 3:4-6; 1:22-23.</li>

2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Gal. 3:14, 16, 29; 4:4-6; Rom. 1:3-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Christ as the Triune God-man (Col. 2:9) is the threefold seed in humanity: the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14; Gal. 4:4), the seed of Abraham (Gen. 12:7; Matt. 1:1; Gal. 3:16), and the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Matt. 1:1; 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Rev. 22:16):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In resurrection Christ, as the last Adam in the flesh, the threefold seed in humanity, became (was transfigured&mdash;pneumatized&mdash;into) the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, to dispense Himself into us (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2) for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>As the seed of the woman, He destroyed God&rsquo;s enemies; as the seed of Abraham, He became the consummated Triune God as our full blessing, the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit; and as the seed of David, He causes us to reign in life, share in His kingship, and become His kingdom that fills the whole earth, making the whole earth God&rsquo;s kingdom (Dan. 2:34-35).</li>
	<li>Thus, the enemies are gone, the blessing is here, and we are in the kingdom&mdash;this is the good news of the revelation of the entire Bible!</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the seed of the woman refers to the incarnated Christ, the complete God who became a perfect man through the dispensing of Himself into humanity and the One who destroyed Satan to save the believers in Christ from sin and death&mdash;Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:16, 20-21, 23; Gal. 4:4; John 1:1, 14; 8:24, 28, 58; Heb. 2:14; 1 Cor. 15:53-57:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;God sent forth His Son, born of a woman,&rdquo; for our judicial redemption; God &ldquo;sent forth the Spirit of His Son,&rdquo; the transfiguration of His Son, to &ldquo;sonize&rdquo; us for our organic salvation&mdash;Gal. 4:4-6; 3:13-14.</li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of the woman, dispensed into us to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head in us and make us the corporate seed of the woman, the overcoming man-child, to carry out God&rsquo;s judgment on the ancient serpent and to be God&rsquo;s dispensational instrument to change the age and usher in the manifestation of God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;Rev. 12:5.</li>
	<li>The Lord as the leading Overcomer (3:21) is the Head, center, reality, life, and nature of the man-child, and the man-child as the following overcomers is the Lord&rsquo;s Body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way to become the man-child is for us to be daily strengthened into our inner man, to be empowered to experience the riches of Christ, and to be strong through putting on the all-inclusive Christ as the armor, taking the word by means of all prayer&mdash;Eph. 3:16; 6:10-20.</li>
		<li>The spontaneous life-power of Christ as the life-seed bruises the serpent&rsquo;s head in us as we employ the blood of the Lamb, speak forth the word of our testimony, and love not our soul-life even unto death&mdash;Rom. 8:2; Rev. 12:10-11; Acts 1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the seed of Abraham is for the blessing to all the families of the earth; as the last Adam, the unique seed of Abraham became the life-giving Spirit&mdash;Gen. 12:2-3, 7; 17:7-8; Gal. 3:14, 16, 29; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 12:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of Abraham, the seed of Abraham, dispensed into us to make us the sons of Abraham, the corporate seed of Abraham, those who can receive and inherit the consummated Spirit as the blessing of Abraham&mdash;Gal. 3:7, 14; 4:28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8), which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17).</li>
		<li>Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the blessing of Abraham (Gal. 3:14), the reality of both the seed of Abraham and the good land promised to Abraham; our blessing today is God Himself, who is embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We can continually receive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit for His growth in us as the seed of Abraham and for our enjoyment of Him as the land promised to Abraham by the hearing of faith&mdash;vv. 2, 5; 2 Cor. 4:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To receive the Spirit, we need to have an ear to hear what the Spirit says to the churches (Rev. 2:7; cf. Heb. 5:11-14); the measure of the Spirit that can be dispensed into our inward parts depends on the measure of our hearing (Mark 4:23-25; Matt. 13:14-16; 5:3, 8; Luke 10:38-42).</li>
		<li>We need to be one with Christ as the Slave-Savior by loving Him to the uttermost and taking Him as our absolute consecration, giving Him the way to open our ear to hear His divine instructions, His fresh messages, which dispense the divine Spirit into us for our service to God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son&mdash;Exo. 21:1-6; Isa. 50:4-5; Phil. 3:3; John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rom. 1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the seed of David refers to the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who carries out God&rsquo;s eternal economy by dispensing Himself into the members of His Body so that they may reign in life to share His kingship as His co-kings&mdash;2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Rom. 1:3-4; 5:17; Rev. 20:4, 6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord of David in His divinity, the Root of David, was incarnated to become the son of David, the Offspring of David, in His humanity, to be the last Adam; and the last Adam, the son of David, was resurrected to become the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit, a transfigured descendant of David, dispensed into us to make us the many sons of God and co-kings of Christ&mdash;Matt. 22:41-46; Rev. 22:16; John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 12:24; Rom. 8:28-29; Acts 13:33; Rom. 5:17.</li>

		<li>We are being saved in His life to be deified for the expression of God, and we are reigning in life by the abundance of grace in the church as the kingdom of God to be victorious for the dominion of God&mdash;vv. 10, 17; 14:17.</li>
		<li>Such an organic salvation is in the Body for the building up of the Body in the local churches to consummate the New Jerusalem as the city of life and the ultimate consummation of God becoming man that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of David, the seed of David, dispensed into us as God&rsquo;s sure mercies, His eternal covenant, for our enjoyment&mdash;Isa. 55:1-3, 6-11; Acts 13:33-35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Acts 13:34 Paul interprets God&rsquo;s sure mercies (Heb. <em>chesed</em>) in Isaiah 55:3 as &ldquo;the holy things of David, the faithful things,&rdquo; and in Acts 13:33 and 35 he indicates that these things are the resurrected Christ Himself as the firstborn Son of God and as the Holy One.</li>
		<li>This is also confirmed by Isaiah 55:4, which reveals that the sure mercies are Christ Himself as the Witness, Leader, and Commander to the peoples.</li>
		<li>The resurrected Christ as the seed of David (Rom. 1:3-4) is God&rsquo;s sure mercies shown to David through his descendant Mary, the mother of Christ (Matt. 1:16), for the dispensing of Himself into all His believers (1 Cor. 15:45b) so that they may experience Him as the abundance of grace to reign in life over Satan, sin, and death (Rom. 5:17, 21).</li>
		<li>He is the mercies and blessings, &ldquo;the holy and faithful things,&rdquo; that God gives to us as a great gift, the eternal covenant with all His unsearchable riches, to be our all-inclusive grace&mdash;Isa. 42:6; 1 Cor. 1:9; cf. Acts 13:43.</li>
		<li>Our spirit is the &ldquo;bank account&rdquo; of all the bequests of the new covenant; by the law of the Spirit of life, all these bequests are dispensed into us and made real to us&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 16; Heb. 8:10; John 16:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of David, the seed of David, dispensed into us for us to share in His kingship in His resurrection in the eternal kingdom of God&mdash;2 Tim. 2:12a; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of David, the seed of David, the seed of the kingdom, dispensed into us to make us the sons of the kingdom, reigning in life to live in the reality of the kingdom so that we may be translated by Him and return with Him in the manifestation of the kingdom as the corporate smiting stone to annihilate the kingdoms of this world and become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, that fills the whole earth&mdash;Mark 4:26; Matt. 13:18-23, 38, 43; Heb. 11:5-6; Gen. 5:21-24; Dan. 2:34-35.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to enjoy and proclaim Christ as the threefold seed in humanity, we need to enter into the following charges to the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension so that we can live in our spirit to be one spirit with Him&mdash;Rom. 6:3-5; Eph. 2:6; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>We must receive God&rsquo;s constant and instant dispensing continuously through unceasing prayer, not quenching the Spirit&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17, 19.</li>
	<li>We must live in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection through His cross in our spirit to dispense Him into others for the sake of His Body&mdash;Phil. 3:10.</li>
	<li>We must overcome individualism, sectarianism, and the degradation of Christianity, and we must live the life of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rev. 2:26-27; 3:21.</li>
	<li>We must live Him as the pneumatic Christ by the bountiful supply of His Spirit, the supply of the Body, for the furtherance of the gospel&mdash;Phil. 1:5, 19b-21a; Psa. 133.</li>
	<li>We must be filled with the Spirit within and without, and we must live and walk according to the Spirit in our spirit for the advancement of the gospel of Christ as the threefold seed in humanity&mdash;the good news of the revelation of the entire Bible&mdash;Acts 13:52; 4:31b; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4b; Phil. 1:12.</li>

	<li>As God incarnate, the Lord Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God, to establish a realm in which God can carry out His purpose through the exercise of His authority&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 3:3, 5; 18:36; Mark 4:3, 26-29; Matt. 12:28.</li>
	<li>From God&rsquo;s point of view, the kingdom is the development of God Himself as the seed of life; from the point of view of God&rsquo;s enemy, the kingdom is the subduing of rebellion&mdash;Mark 4:26-27; Matt. 12:28.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The fundamental problem in the universe is rebellion against the authority of God&mdash;Isa. 14:12-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Satan intends to violate God&rsquo;s sovereignty, usurp God&rsquo;s authority, overthrow God&rsquo;s throne, and establish his own kingdom&mdash;Matt. 12:26; Eph. 2:2.</li>
	<li>When man fell, he rebelled against God, put God&rsquo;s authority aside, denied God&rsquo;s authority, and rejected God&rsquo;s rule&mdash;Gen. 3:6, 11; Rom. 5:12; 1 John 3:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Through the gospel of the kingdom, God brings people under the ruling of the heavenly authority so that they may become His kingdom, those who are ruled by His authority&mdash;Matt. 24:14; Rev. 1:5-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament preaches the gospel in the way of the kingdom; because the kingdom of God is the real gospel, to know the gospel requires that we know the kingdom&mdash;Mark 1:14-15; Acts 8:12.</li>
	<li>The gospel is for the kingdom, and the gospel is proclaimed so that rebellious sinners might be saved, qualified, and equipped to enter into the kingdom of God&mdash;Mark 1:14-15; Matt. 4:17; Acts 8:12:

	<li>To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose&mdash;Luke 3:3, 8; 5:32; 17:3; Acts 17:30-31.</li>
	<li>Repentance is mainly for us to enter into the kingdom of God; unless we repent&mdash;that is, have a change of concept&mdash;we cannot enter into the kingdom&mdash;Mark 1:15; Matt. 3:2; 4:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As believers in Christ, we have been regenerated to enter into the kingdom of God as the realm of the divine species to live under the rule of God in life, light, and love&mdash;John 3:3, 5, 15-16; Col. 1:12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">

	<li>We have been born into the kingdom of God, and now the divine life in our spirit knows the kingdom of God&mdash;John 3:5-6.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God into which we have entered through regeneration is a realm of the divine species; we have entered into this divine realm by being born of God to become children of God, God-men, who have the life and nature of God&mdash;1:12-13; 3:3, 5.</li>

<li>Due to man&rsquo;s fall, among mankind there are many ordinances, customs, habits, and ways to live and worship, all of which have divided, scattered, and confused mankind; there are partitions between every nationality and race, and thus among the human race there is no peace, only enmity, discord, and war&mdash;Eph. 2:14-15; cf. Psa. 46:9; Isa. 2:4; 9:6-7; 11:6-9; Micah 4:3; Zech. 9:10.</li>

		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>On the cross the arrow was shot into the heart of the enemy, the battle was fought, and the victory was won; thus, the bow without an arrow is a declaration that the war is over and that the victory has been won for the constituting of the gospel of peace&mdash;Psa. 45:5; John 12:31; Heb. 2:14; Eph. 6:15.</li>

		<li>The uniting bars of the tabernacle signify the mingled spirit&mdash;the divine Spirit mingled with the regenerated human spirit&mdash;to become the uniting bond of peace; in our experience, the uniting bond of peace is the cooperation of our spirit with the uniting Spirit, the crossing Spirit&mdash;Exo. 26:26-29; Eph. 4:3.</li>

		<li>In proclaiming the gospel of the glory of Christ, we should not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, who is the content of the gospel (v. 5); Christ Jesus as Lord comprises:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever&mdash;Rom. 9:5.</li>
			<li>The eternal Word incarnated to be a man&mdash;John 1:1, 14.</li>
			<li>Jesus crucified as a man to be our Savior and resurrected to be the Son of God&mdash;Acts 4:10-12; 13:33.</li>
			<li>Christ exalted to be the Lord, even the Lord of all men, who is the image of God, the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;2:36; 10:36; Rom. 10:12; John 20:28; 1 Cor. 12:3; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Those who receive the gospel of glory through our shining will have Christ as the precious treasure dispensed into them; then, like us, they will be earthen vessels containing this priceless treasure&mdash;2 Cor. 4:4, 6-7.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Structure of the Gospel of God&mdash;<br />
the Righteousness of God, the Life of Christ,<br />
and the Faith of the Believers</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:16-17; 3:22; 5:1-11; 10:17; Heb. 11:1; 12:1-2a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The key word concerning the gospel of God in Romans and the banner of God&rsquo;s eternal economy is Romans 1:17, which reveals the structure of the gospel of God&mdash;&ldquo;the <span class="underline">righteous</span> shall have <span class="underline">life</span> and live by <span class="underline">faith</span>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The righteousness of God is the procedure of God&rsquo;s salvation judicially&mdash;vv. 16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God cannot forgive sinful people without meeting the demands of His righteousness (Psa. 103:6-7); according to His righteousness, &ldquo;the soul who sins, he shall die&rdquo; (Ezek. 18:4) and &ldquo;the wages of sin is death&rdquo; (Rom. 6:23):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ died a vicarious death as the Substitute for sinners, a death that was legal according to God&rsquo;s law and was recognized and approved by God according to the law&mdash;Isa. 53:5-6; 2 Cor. 5:21; Matt. 27:45-46.</li>
		<li>Christ, the righteous One, was judged on behalf of us, the unrighteous, by the righteous God according to His righteousness, that He might remove the barrier of our sins and bring us to God&mdash;1 Pet. 3:18.</li>
		<li>On the cross Jesus was made sin for us, condemned sin in the flesh, and by dying on our behalf fulfilled all God&rsquo;s righteousness; now for the sake of His righteousness, God must forgive us&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3, 10; John 19:30.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because God is bound by His righteousness to forgive us, righteousness is the power of God&rsquo;s salvation and the unshakable foundation of our salvation&mdash;Rom. 1:16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our experience of Christ rests on the foundation of God&rsquo;s righteousness, which is the solid, steadfast, and unshakable foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14) and the base on which His kingdom is built (Rom. 14:17).</li>
		<li>God has put Christ to death on our behalf, He has recognized the death of Christ as the full payment of our debt of sins, and the resurrected and ascended Christ sitting at the right hand of God is the &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; of this payment&mdash;4:24-25.</li>
		<li>Thus, whenever we claim the blood of Jesus and appeal to God&rsquo;s righteousness, He has no choice except to forgive us&mdash;1 John 1:9; <em>Hymns,</em> #1003.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Life is the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation; thus, justification is &ldquo;of life&rdquo;; through justification we have come up to the standard of God&rsquo;s righteousness and correspond with it so that now He can impart His life into us&mdash;Rom. 5:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The life of Christ is the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation organically&mdash;v. 10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The result of our justification is the full enjoyment of God in Christ as our life; in God&rsquo;s organic salvation we have love, grace, peace, hope, life, glory, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God as our enjoyment&mdash;vv. 1-11.</li>
	<li>The saving life of Christ is accomplishing the organic goal of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation in the following ways&mdash;v. 10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have been justified by God in Christ as the righteousness from God to us so that we may live in this life before God&mdash;1:17.</li>
		<li>This life makes the God-justified believers the many sons of God (8:14; Heb. 2:10), who are the many brothers of Christ (Rom. 8:29) through regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3) by the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) with God&rsquo;s producing and multiplying life.</li>
		<li>This life is imparted into the dying believers so that they may grow in Christ out of death unto maturity&mdash;v. 11.</li>
		<li>The indwelling Christ moves in the believers by the Spirit of life so that they may enjoy Christ&rsquo;s life with its peace&mdash;vv. 5-6.</li>
		<li>This life sanctifies us with the holy nature of God as the holy element&mdash;6:19-20.</li>
		<li>This life renews us, by the Spirit of life, based upon the washing of regeneration, from the old element of our old man into the new constitution of our new man&mdash;12:2b; Titus 3:5.</li>
		<li>This life transforms us metabolically by the Spirit of life with the element of Christ&rsquo;s divine life, from our old constitution to our new constitution, for the building up of Christ&rsquo;s organic Body&mdash;Rom. 12:2b, 5; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>This life conforms us to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God so that we may be full-grown God-men for the Triune God&rsquo;s expression&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>This life glorifies us through the redemption of our body so that we may enter into the freedom of glory and our full sonship&mdash;vv. 21, 23, 30.</li>
		<li>This life makes us reign as kings over Satan, sin, and death&mdash;5:17, 21.</li>
		<li>All the above ten items are for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ expressed as the local churches; this is covered in the last five chapters of the book of Romans.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The faith of the believers is the substantiation of God&rsquo;s salvation practically&mdash;Heb. 11:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith&mdash;Rom. 1:12; 3:22 and footnote 1; Gal. 2:16 and footnote 1.</li>
	<li>Our believing into Christ is our appreciation of Him as a reaction to His attraction&mdash;Rom. 10:17; Heb. 12:1-2a; cf. Acts 14:27.</li>
	<li>Faith comes out of the hearing of the word; when we come to the living Word (Christ) in the written word (the Bible), He becomes the applied word (the Spirit) of faith to us&mdash;Rom. 10:8, 17; Gal. 3:2; cf. Heb. 3:12.</li>
	<li>When man hears Christ, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, becoming the faith in man that enables man to believe in Him&mdash;12:2a; Rom. 10:17; Gal. 3:2, 5; 5:6.</li>
	<li>Faith is to believe that God is and we are not; He must be the only One, the unique One, in everything, and we must be nothing in everything&mdash;Heb. 11:1, 5-6.</li>
	<li>As believers, we live by faith and infuse Christ as faith into others by exercising our spirit of faith (2 Cor. 4:13; Rom. 10:14-17; Acts 26:22-29) so that they may be brought into the following organic relationships with Christ for His purpose:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the cultivated olive tree and the vine, and we are His branches&mdash;Rom. 11:17, 24; John 15:1-8.</li>
		<li>Christ is the Head, and we are His members&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12, 27.</li>
		<li>Christ is the breath of life, the water of life, and the bread of life, and we are His breathers, drinkers, and eaters&mdash;John 20:22; 4:10, 14; 7:37-39a; 6:35, 51-63, 68.</li>
		<li>Christ is the Bridegroom, and we are His bride&mdash;3:29-30; 2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith is the subjective God applied to our being; thus, just as nothing is impossible to God, nothing is impossible to faith&mdash;Matt. 17:20; 19:26.</li>
	<li>The great irrepressible and unlimited power of faith motivates thousands to suffer for the Lord, risk their lives, and become overcoming sent ones and martyrs to spread the gospel of God&rsquo;s eternal economy unto the uttermost part of the earth&mdash;Luke 18:8; Rom. 16:3-4; Acts 20:24; 1 Tim. 1:4, 11-12; Matt. 24:14; Acts 1:8.</li>

<li>In our living and serving, we should concentrate on enjoying and ministering Christ to dispense Him into others as the unique treasure of untold wealth in the universe, not on any persons, matters, or things other than Christ&mdash;vv. 9, 30; 2:2; 4:1-2; 2 Cor. 3:3, 6; 4:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The proper preaching of Jesus as the glad tidings, the gospel, causes people to realize that they are nothing and that Christ is everything&mdash;Isa. 40:15, 17; cf. Phil. 3:7-8.</li>
	<li>Our Savior, Jesus, is the Holy One, the eternal God, Jehovah, and the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who sits above the circle of the earth; as the Holy One, Jesus is unlimited, unsearchable, incomparable, and high&mdash;Isa. 40:12-15, 17-18, 22, 25-26, 28; Rom. 1:20; 11:34; Col. 1:15-18; Heb. 1:2-3; 11:1-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way to enjoy the unsearchably rich Christ is to take Him as our real Sabbath rest, stopping ourselves with our living, doing, and activity, and receive Him as our life, person, and replacement; then we will experience Christ as the power of resurrection to be transformed and to soar in the heavens far above every earthly frustration&mdash;Matt. 11:28-30; Isa. 40:28-31.</li>
		<li>God wants us to stop our doing, be replaced by Christ, and keep away from the taste of anything other than Christ&mdash;Gal. 2:20; John 6:57; Isa. 55:1-2; 58:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ Himself is our unsearchably rich portion and inheritance; our reward for our priestly service is to eat Christ and enjoy Him as everything to us&mdash;Num. 18:20, 31; John 6:57; Gen. 15:1; Psa. 43:4a; Phil. 3:8-9, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We can enjoy the riches of Christ by calling on His name&mdash;the Lord is &ldquo;rich to all who call upon Him; for &lsquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 10:12b-13.</li>

		<li>We can enjoy the bountiful supply of the Body of Christ and His universal dimensions when we abide in Christ as our prison to live Him for His magnification and to receive God&rsquo;s visions and heavenly expressions on behalf of the saints&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; Eph. 3:1, 16-18; 4:1.</li>
		<li>We can enjoy the treasure of His indwelling presence by loving Him in the midst of consuming pressures and tribulations, which are the sweet visitation and incarnation of grace for the God of resurrection to add Himself to us&mdash;2 Cor. 4:7; 1:8-9, 12; 12:7-10; Rom. 5:3; 8:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel are revealed in all twenty-seven books of the New Testament; this wonderful, heavenly Christ is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, reaching us as the consummated life-giving Spirit, so that we can continually receive Him as grace upon grace to be renewed day by day for serving our God in newness of spirit in the gospel of His Son&mdash;John 1:14, 16; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 1:9; 7:6:

	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s goal in His economy is not merely to redeem His people and save them from the world, typified by Egypt, but to bring them into Christ, typified by the good land, so that they may possess Him and enjoy His unsearchable riches&mdash;Exo. 3:8; Deut. 8:7-10; Col. 1:12; 2:6-7a; Eph. 3:8:

		<li>The valleys and the mountains signify the different kinds of environments in which we may experience Christ as the flowing Spirit&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 6:8-10.</li>
		<li>Wheat typifies the incarnated Christ, who was crucified and buried to multiply Himself (John 12:24), and barley, being the first-ripe grain (2 Sam. 21:9), points to the resurrected Christ as the firstfruits (1 Cor. 15:20).</li>
		<li>Vines typify the Christ who sacrificed Himself to produce wine to cheer God and man&mdash;Judg. 9:13; Matt. 9:17.</li>

	<li>By enjoying the riches of the land, the children of Israel were able to build up the temple to be God&rsquo;s habitation on earth and the city of Jerusalem to establish God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth.</li>
	<li>Likewise, by enjoying the unsearchable riches of Christ, the believers in Christ are built up to be Christ&rsquo;s Body, the church, which is Christ&rsquo;s fullness, His expression (1:22-23), and which is also the habitation of God (2:21-22; 1 Tim. 3:15) and the kingdom of God (Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17).</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The basic revelation in the Bible is the unveiling, the bringing to light, of God&rsquo;s mystery; for this reason, the Bible speaks of the revelation of the mystery&mdash;Rom. 16:25; Eph. 3:3, 5.</li>
<li>The gospel is the proclamation of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery; thus, Paul could speak of the mystery of the gospel&mdash;6:19.</li>
<li>There are five great mysteries in the Bible:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The mystery of the universe is God, who is the meaning and purpose of the universe&mdash;Gen. 1:1; Rev. 4:11; Eph. 3:9.</li>
	<li>The mystery of man is also God&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Zech. 12:1; 1 Cor. 2:11.</li>

	<li>The mystery of Christ is the church&mdash;Eph. 3:4; Col. 4:3.</li>
	<li>The mystery of the church is the organism of Christ, the Body of Christ as the enlargement of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 4:4, 16; 5:30, 32.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Ephesians <em>mystery</em> is a crucial word:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In eternity God planned a will, but it was hidden in Him; hence, it was a mystery&mdash;the mystery of His will&mdash;1:9.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s hidden purpose is the mystery, and the unveiling of this mystery in the mingled spirit is the revelation of the mystery&mdash;3:3, 5.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s mystery is His hidden purpose, and with this mystery there is an economy&mdash;the economy of the mystery&mdash;v. 9.</li>
	<li>Christ is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ&mdash;v. 4; Col. 4:3.</li>
	<li>Christ and the church as one spirit are the great mystery&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 5:32.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ, who indwells us, is the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Col. 1:26-27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is like a great wheel, having Christ as its every part&mdash;He is the hub (the center), the spokes (the support), and the rim (the circumference) of the divine economy&mdash;Ezek. 1:15; Col. 1:17b, 18b:

		<li>The hope of our calling is the hope of glory, which is the transfiguration of our body and the manifestation of the sons of God&mdash;Eph. 1:18b; 4:4b; Rom. 8:19, 23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21.</li>

		<li>Christ as the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy is indwelling us as the hope of glory for our transformation from glory to glory unto the full expression of God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rev. 21:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In particular, the mystery of the gospel is Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 6:19:

			<li>The first stage is God Himself as the mystery of the universe, the second stage is Christ as the mystery of God, and the third stage is the church as the mystery of Christ&mdash;John 1:18; Col. 2:2; 4:3.</li>
			<li>The church is the mystery of Christ, who is the mystery of God, who Himself is the mystery of the universe&mdash;Eph. 3:4, 9; Col. 2:2; Rev. 4:11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The church is according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and God created all things so that He could have the church&mdash;Eph. 3:9, 11; Rev. 4:11.</li>
		<li>The church is a constitution of the riches of Christ enjoyed and assimilated by the believers&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>Through the church the multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies&mdash;v. 10.</li>
		<li>Related to the mystery of Christ, the church, there is the economy of the mystery; God&rsquo;s economy is His plan and arrangement to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity into His chosen people in order to produce the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem for the eternal corporate expression of the Triune God; this is the greatest mystery in the universe; nothing is greater or more important than this&mdash;v. 9; 1:22-23; 4:16; Rev. 21:2, 10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All these mysteries are related to the gospel; thus, the mystery of the gospel refers to the entire New Testament economy, and through the gospel we may become persons of meaning and enjoy God as the mystery of the universe&mdash;Eph. 6:19; Psa. 36:8-9.</li>

<h1 class="title">Serving God in Our Spirit in the Gospel of His Son</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:1, 9; 15:16</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>For all the requirements related to the believers revealed in the New Testament, especially that of announcing the gospel of God, we need to receive the divine supply of the Body through the dispensing of the processed Triune God&mdash;Eph. 3:2; Heb. 4:16; Rom. 5:17, 21; John 7:37-38; Acts 6:4; Phil. 1:5-6, 19-25.</li>
<li>We need to see that our service to God in the gospel is our worship to God; in the New Testament, serving God is actually the same as worshipping God&mdash;Matt. 4:9-10; S. S. 1:2; cf. Psa. 2:11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul said that the believers at Thessalonica &ldquo;turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God&rdquo;&mdash;1 Thes. 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God must be living to us and in us in every aspect of our daily life; the fact that God controls, directs, corrects, and adjusts us, even in such small things as our thoughts and motives, is a proof that He is living&mdash;Phil. 1:8; 2:5, 13; 1:20.</li>
		<li>We live under the control, direction, and correction of a living God to be a pattern of the glad tidings that we spread&mdash;1 Thes. 1:5-8; 2:10; 2 Thes. 3:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As believers in Christ, we must live a life in our spirit which bears the testimony that the God whom we worship and serve is living in the details of our life; the reason we do not do or say certain things should be that God is living in us&mdash;Rom. 8:6, 16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul said that he was &ldquo;separated unto the gospel of God&rdquo; (1:1), and he declared, &ldquo;God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son&rdquo; (v. 9):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Greek word for <em>serve</em> in Romans 1:9 means &ldquo;serve in worship,&rdquo; as used in Matthew 4:10, 2 Timothy 1:3, Philippians 3:3, and Luke 2:37; Paul considered his preaching of the gospel as a worship and service to God, not merely a work.</li>
	<li>When we come to serve God, or worship God, we need a blood-purified conscience; our defiled conscience needs to be purified so that we may serve God in a living way&mdash;Heb. 9:14; 10:22; 1 John 1:7, 9; Acts 24:16; cf. 1 Tim. 4:7.</li>
	<li>To serve God in the gospel is to serve Him in the all-inclusive Christ, because the gospel is simply Christ Himself&mdash;Acts 5:42; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>
	<li>In order to preach the gospel of God&rsquo;s Son, we must be in our regenerated spirit (1:9); in the book of Romans Paul stressed that whatever we are (2:29; 8:5-6, 9), whatever we have (vv. 10, 16), and whatever we do toward God (1:9; 7:6; 8:4, 13; 12:11) must be in our spirit.</li>
	<li>Paul served God in his regenerated spirit by the indwelling Christ, the life-giving Spirit, not in his soul by the power and ability of the soul; this is the first important item in his preaching of the gospel.</li>
	<li>The gospel of God, unto which Paul was separated, is the subject of the book of Romans; the book of Romans may be regarded as the fifth gospel&mdash;1:1; 2:16; 16:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first four Gospels are concerning the incarnated Christ, Christ in the flesh, living among His disciples; the gospel in Romans is concerning the resurrected Christ as the Spirit living within His disciples&mdash;8:2, 6, 9-11, 16.</li>
		<li>We need the fifth gospel, the book of Romans, to reveal the subjective Savior within us as the subjective gospel of Christ.</li>
		<li>The central message of the book of Romans is that God desires to transform sinners in the flesh into sons of God in the spirit in order to constitute the Body of Christ expressed as the local churches&mdash;v. 29; 12:1-5; ch. 16.</li>
		<li>All of us need to function as priests of the gospel of God according to the revelation of the book of Romans; we need to learn the elements and details of the gospel, we need to experience the full content of the gospel, and we need to exercise our spirit to learn how to minister the gospel&mdash;15:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo;&mdash;John 4:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To contact God the Spirit with the spirit is to drink of the living water, and to drink of the living water is to render real worship to God&mdash;vv. 10-14.</li>
	<li>God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son for sinners to believe into Him and drink of Him as the flowing Triune God in order for them to become the totality of eternal life, the New Jerusalem&mdash;3:16; 4:14b; cf. Jer. 2:13.</li>
	<li>According to typology, God should be worshipped in the place chosen by Him for His habitation (Deut. 12:5, 11, 13-14, 18) and with the offerings (Lev. 1&mdash;6); the place chosen by God for His habitation typifies the human spirit (Eph. 2:22), and the offerings typify Christ (Heb. 10:5-10).</li>
	<li>The divine reality is Christ as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for the worship of God (John 14:6; 1:29; 3:14) and as the fountain of living water, the life-giving Spirit (4:7-15), partaken of and drunk by His believers to become the reality within them (1 Cor. 12:13; John 7:37-39).</li>
	<li>By enjoying Christ as the divine reality of the offerings in our spirit, He becomes our genuineness and sincerity (truthfulness) for the true worship of God&mdash;4:24.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;We are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh&rdquo;&mdash;Phil. 3:3; cf. Rom. 2:28-29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The flesh refers to all that we are and have in our natural being; anything natural, whether it is good or evil, is the flesh&mdash;Phil. 3:4-6.</li>
	<li>As believers in Christ, we should not trust in anything that we have by our natural birth, for everything of our natural birth is part of the flesh.</li>
	<li>Even though we have been regenerated, we may continue to live in our fallen nature, boast in what we do in the flesh, and have confidence in our natural qualifications; therefore, it is important that we be deeply and personally touched by these verses in Philippians 3.</li>
	<li>We need the Lord&rsquo;s light to shine on us concerning our nature, our deeds, and our confidence in the flesh; we need to be enlightened by the Lord to see that we still live too much by the flesh and that we boast in our deeds and qualifications.</li>
	<li>One day, when the light shines on us concerning this, we will want to prostrate ourselves before the Lord and confess how unclean our nature is; then we will condemn everything we do by our fallen nature; we will see that in the eyes of God whatever is done in the fallen nature is evil and worthy of condemnation.</li>
	<li>Formerly, we boasted in our deeds and qualifications, but the time will come when we will condemn the flesh with its qualifications; then we shall boast in Christ alone, realizing that in ourselves we have absolutely no ground for boasting.</li>
	<li>Only when we have been enlightened by God shall we be able to say truly that we have no trust in our natural qualifications, ability, or intelligence; only then shall we be able to testify that our confidence is wholly in the Lord; after we are enlightened in this way, we shall truly serve and worship God in our spirit and by the Spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to serve God in the gospel of His Son, we need to see that we are men in the flesh, worthy of nothing but death and burial&mdash;this is to follow the Lord&rsquo;s pattern to fulfill all righteousness and enter into the ministry of the age&mdash;Matt. 3:13-17; 21:32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The base for Jesus to be baptized is that He considered Himself, according to His humanity, a man, especially an Israelite, who is a man &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; (John 1:14); even though He was only &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3), &ldquo;without sin&rdquo; (Heb. 4:15), yet He was &ldquo;in the flesh,&rdquo; which has nothing good but is worthy only of death and burial.</li>
	<li>Based upon this fact, at the beginning of His ministry for God, He was willing to be baptized by John the Baptist, recognizing that, according to His humanity, He was one who did not have any qualification to be a servant of God.</li>
	<li>As a man in the flesh, He needed to be a dead man buried in the death water to fulfill God&rsquo;s New Testament requirement according to His righteousness, and He did it willingly, considering it the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s righteousness.</li>
	<li>This shows that we should not bring anything of our natural life, anything of our flesh, into God&rsquo;s ministry in the service of His gospel.</li>
	<li>We all should declare in our life and work, &ldquo;I am a person in the flesh, worthy of nothing but death and burial, so I want to have myself terminated, crucified, and buried&rdquo;&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Our work and labor for the Lord in the gospel is not by our natural life and natural ability but by the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life and power; resurrection is the eternal principle in our service to God&mdash;Num. 17:8; 1 Cor. 15:10, 58; 16:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is the reality of the Triune God, the reality of resurrection, and the reality of the Body of Christ&mdash;John 16:13-15; 20:22; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Eph. 4:4.</li>
	<li>Resurrection means that everything is of God and not of us, that God alone is able and that we are not able, and that everything is done by God and not by ourselves&mdash;Num. 17:8.</li>
	<li>All those who know resurrection have given up hope in themselves; they know that they cannot make it; everything that is of death belongs to us, and everything that is of life belongs to the Lord&mdash;2 Cor. 1:8-9; cf. Eccl. 9:4.</li>
	<li>We must acknowledge that we are nothing, have nothing, and can do nothing; we must come to the end of ourselves to be convinced of our utter uselessness&mdash;Exo. 2:14-15; 3:14-15; Luke 22:32-34; 1 Pet. 5:5-6.</li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit lives in us, enabling us to do what we could never do in ourselves&mdash;1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:8-9, 12; 4:7-18.</li>
	<li>When we do not live by our natural life but live by the divine life within us, we are in resurrection; the issue of this is the reality of the Body of Christ as the goal of the gospel of God&mdash;Phil. 3:10-11; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Faith as the Gospel and<br />
the Goal of the Gospel</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:23; 6:10; 1 Tim. 1:4; Jude 3; Matt. 26:6-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Like Paul, we should announce the faith as the gospel&mdash;Gal. 1:23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The faith is the contents of the complete gospel according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; hence, it is objective&mdash;1 Tim. 1:19; 2:7; 3:9; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 12, 21; 2 Tim. 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith, in which we believe for our salvation&mdash;Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 6:21; 2 Tim. 2:18.</li>
		<li>In Galatians 1:23 <em>the faith</em> implies our believing in Christ, taking His person and His redemptive work as the object of our faith.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith refers to the act of believing in the gospel, in God, and in His word and deeds; hence, it is subjective&mdash;1 Tim. 1:2, 4-5, 14, 19; 2:15; 2 Tim. 1:5; 2:22.</li>
	<li>Galatians gives us a revelation of the faith as the gospel in certain basic principles&mdash;1:11-12, 23; 2:5, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Fallen man cannot be justified out of works of law&mdash;v. 16a.</li>
		<li>Under God&rsquo;s New Testament economy we are not to keep the law; rather, we are justified out of faith in Christ&mdash;v. 16b.</li>
		<li>We are dead to the law, we are alive to God, and we have Christ living in us&mdash;vv. 19-20.</li>
		<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy we have life and live by faith&mdash;3:11.</li>
		<li>The gospel was preached to Abraham; the New Testament economy is a continuation of God&rsquo;s dealing with Abraham&mdash;vv. 8-14.</li>
		<li>We receive the promise of the Spirit through faith&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>In Christ we are a new creation&mdash;6:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is initiated and developed in the sphere of faith; faith is the unique way for God to carry out His New Testament economy with His chosen and redeemed people&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Heb. 11:6.</li>
	<li>The objective faith produces subjective faith&mdash;Gal. 1:23; 2:20; 3:1-2, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faith is a matter of seeing a view of the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Heb. 12:2.</li>
		<li>Because we have seen a revelation regarding the contents of God&rsquo;s economy, we spontaneously believe in what we see&mdash;Eph. 3:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through the faith as the gospel, we are members of the household of the faith; this household is composed of all who are sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus&mdash;Gal. 6:10; 3:26.</li>
	<li>We should hold the mystery of the faith&mdash;the things which constitute the gospel&mdash;in a pure conscience&mdash;1 Tim. 3:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The mystery of the faith is mainly Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ&mdash;Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4.</li>
		<li>A serving one should hold the mystery of the faith with full understanding in a pure conscience for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony&mdash;1 Tim. 3:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To keep the faith is to keep the entire New Testament economy of God&mdash;the faith concerning Christ as the embodiment of God and the mystery of God and the church as the Body of Christ and the mystery of Christ&mdash;2 Tim. 4:7c.</li>
	<li>The faith has been delivered once for all to the saints, and for this faith we should contend&mdash;Jude 3.</li>
	<li>We need to arrive at the oneness of the faith; the speciality of the church is the faith, which is composed of our beliefs concerning the Bible, God, Christ, the work of Christ, salvation, and the church&mdash;Eph. 4:13.</li>
	<li>On the foundation of our most holy faith and in the sphere of it, we need to build up ourselves; as we build ourselves up in our most holy faith, we build ourselves up in a faith that is both objective and subjective&mdash;Jude 20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The goal of the gospel is that, like Mary, who did &ldquo;what she could,&rdquo; we would pour out upon the Lord Jesus what is most precious to us, even our most costly and valuable spiritual treasure, &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; ourselves upon Him&mdash;Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, Simon the leper spread a feast in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence; a saved sinner would always do this&mdash;Matt. 26:6-7.</li>
	<li>The gospel of God causes genuine believers to have a great change in their concept of value; whereas others reject the Lord, we treasure Him and value His surpassing worth and supreme preciousness&mdash;Mark 14:3; Matt. 26:7; 1 Pet. 2:4, 6-7.</li>
	<li>Mary received the revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s death through His words, and thus she grasped the opportunity to pour out upon the Lord the best that she had; to love the Lord with our best requires a revelation concerning Him&mdash;Matt. 26:2, 12; 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19.</li>
	<li>The Lord desires that we allow Him to have the first place in all things&mdash;Mark 14:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus should have the first place, the preeminence, in our love, in our tripartite being, in our Christian life and church life, and in everything in our personal universe&mdash;12:30; 14:7; Col. 1:18; 3:4, 11, 17.</li>
		<li>To give the Lord the first place in all things is to love Him with the first love, the best love; in order to give Him the preeminence, we must be willing to be adjusted, to be broken, and to be made nothing so that the Lord can have a way in us, through us, and among us for the building up of His Body&mdash;Rev. 2:4; Gal. 6:3; Eph. 4:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must love the Lord Jesus and grasp the opportunity to love Him; to love the Lord is to appreciate Him, to direct our being toward Him, to open to Him, to enjoy Him, to give Him the first place, to be one with Him, to live Him, and to become Him&mdash;Matt. 26:11; 2 Cor. 3:16; Mark 12:30; Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 6:17; Phil. 1:20-21a; S. S. 6:13.</li>
	<li>Mary did &ldquo;what she could&rdquo;; this means that she gave up her all, lavished all on the Lord, and kept nothing in reserve&mdash;Mark 14:8a.</li>
	<li>Mary anointed the Lord&rsquo;s body &ldquo;beforehand for the burial&rdquo;&mdash;v. 8b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word <em>beforehand</em> introduces the factor of time that should cause us to consider if, in our love for the Lord, we are pouring out our best upon Him today.</li>
		<li>When we see the Lord face to face, we will love Him as never before, and we will pour out everything for Him, but it will be the most blessed for those who have poured out their all upon the Lord today&mdash;Matt. 26:7; Mark 14:3; John 12:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The disciples considered Mary&rsquo;s love offering to the Lord a &ldquo;waste,&rdquo; but the Lord intends that the gospel should cause believers to come to Him and &ldquo;waste&rdquo; themselves on Him&mdash;Mark 14:4; Matt. 26:8 and footnote 1.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her&rdquo;&mdash;v. 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;This gospel&rdquo; refers to the gospel of the Lord&rsquo;s death, burial, and resurrection&mdash;Mark 14:9; 1 Cor. 15:1-4.</li>
		<li>The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord&mdash;Matt. 26:13; Gal. 2:20; Mark 12:30:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We must preach both the Lord loving us and us loving the Lord; one is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration&mdash;John 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:14-15.</li>
			<li>The gospel tells us how the Lord loved us, but the loving story of Mary stirs up our love for the Lord; thus, there needs to be a mutual love, and this must accompany the preaching of the gospel&mdash;Matt. 26:13.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The genuine, intrinsic, highest, and fullest gospel is the gospel of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;the gospel of sonship for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ by the building of God into man and man into God&mdash;1 Tim. 1:3-4; Eph. 3:8-11, 16-19; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29; 12:5; 2 Sam. 7:12-14a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must believe that there is a God-created ability within man to receive and understand His gospel&mdash;Job 32:8; Zech. 12:1; Eccl. 3:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should not preach a gospel that has been lowered down to what we think is the level of people&rsquo;s understanding; we should preach an uplifted gospel and never lower the concept&mdash;1 Thes. 1:1, 3-4, 10; 5:23; 1 Cor. 2:7-13.</li>
		<li>Man was created for God, and within man there is the ability to understand the things of God, and there is a hunger for these things&mdash;Acts 17:26-31; Isa. 43:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must present the truth concerning the economy of God item by item according to the entire Bible; this is the Lord&rsquo;s special commission to us&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9; 9:16-17, 23; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2:7; 4:16; 2 Tim. 1:11; 2:2, 15; Col. 1:28.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel of God&rsquo;s eternal economy is &ldquo;the gospel of the promise made to the fathers&rdquo; (Acts 13:32)&mdash;the promise that the seed of David would become the Son of God, that is, that a human seed would become a divine Son (vv. 22-23, 33-34; 26:6, 16-19; 2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Rom. 1:3-4; Matt. 22:41-45).</li>
<li><em>The seed of David becoming the Son of God</em> speaks of the process of Christ&rsquo;s being designated the firstborn Son of God by resurrection&mdash;Rom. 8:29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul said that he was separated unto the gospel of God concerning God&rsquo;s Son, which indicates that the gospel of God is the gospel of sonship for the reality of the Body of Christ in the local churches&mdash;1:1, 3-4; 8:28-30; 12:5; 16:20.</li>
	<li>Romans 1:3-4 is the fulfillment of the prophecy in typology in 2 Samuel 7:12-14a, unveiling the mystery of God becoming man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</li>
	<li>By incarnation Christ, the only begotten Son of God in His divinity (John 1:18), put on the flesh, the human nature, which had nothing to do with divinity; in His humanity He was not the Son of God.</li>
	<li>In resurrection His humanity was deified, sonized, meaning that He was designated the Son of God, becoming the firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
	<li>Thus, in Christ God was constituted into man, man was constituted into God, and God and man were mingled together to be one entity, the God-man.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s gospel and His intention in His economy are to build God into man and man into God; this building is God becoming a man (the seed of David) that man might become God (the Son of God).</li>
	<li>This gospel was spoken by the Lord Jesus when He said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&rdquo;&mdash;John 12:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If a seed dies by being buried in the soil, it will eventually sprout, grow, and blossom in resurrection, because the operation of the seed&rsquo;s life is activated simultaneously with its death&mdash;1 Cor. 15:36; 1 Pet. 3:18.</li>
		<li>The divinity, the Spirit of holiness, in Christ became operative in His death, and in resurrection He &ldquo;blossomed&rdquo; to be the firstborn Son of God and the life-dispensing Spirit, imparting His divine life into us to make us His many brothers&mdash;Rom. 1:4; 8:29; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>The prototype is the firstborn Son of God, and the reproduction is the many sons of God, the members of the prototype to be His Body, which consummates in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Col. 1:18; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li><em>The seed of David becoming the Son of God</em> speaks also of the process of our being designated the many sons of God by resurrection&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11:

	<li>Christ has already been designated the Son of God, but we are still in the process of designation, the process of being sonized, deified&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
	<li>The life of the Son of God has been implanted into our spirit&mdash;v. 10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Now we, like the seed that is sown into the earth, must pass through the process of death and resurrection&mdash;John 12:24-26.</li>
		<li>This causes the outer man to be consumed, but it enables the inner life to grow, to develop, and ultimately, to blossom from within us; this is resurrection&mdash;1 Cor. 15:31, 36; 2 Cor. 4:10-12, 16-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In resurrection Christ in His humanity was designated the Son of God, and by means of such a resurrection we also are in the process of being designated sons of God&mdash;Rom. 8:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The process of our being designated, sonized, deified, is the process of resurrection with four main aspects&mdash;sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification&mdash;6:22; 12:2; 8:29-30.</li>
		<li>The key to the process of designation is resurrection, which is the indwelling Christ as the rising-up Spirit, the designating Spirit, the power of life in our spirit&mdash;John 11:25; Rom. 8:10-11; Acts 2:24; 1 Cor. 15:26; 5:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We urgently need to learn how to walk according to the spirit, to enjoy and experience the designating Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 6, 14.</li>
			<li>The more we touch the Spirit, the more we are sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified to become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 12:3; Rom. 10:12-13; 8:15-16; Gal. 4:6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The more we grow in life and pass through the metabolic process of transformation, the more we are designated the sons of God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18, 6, 16; 5:4, 9, 14-15; 1:12; 12:7-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This metabolic process is the building up of the church as the Body of Christ and the house of God by the building of God into man and man into God&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:20-22.</li>
		<li>Humanity is designated in divinity, and divinity and humanity are blended as one; today, we, seeds of humanity, are becoming sons of God in divinity through the process of God&rsquo;s building.</li>
		<li>This building will consummate in the New Jerusalem as a great, corporate God-man, the aggregate, the totality, of all the sons of God&mdash;Rev. 21:7.</li>
		<li>One day this process will be completed, and for eternity we will be the same as Christ, God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, in our spirit, soul, and body&mdash;1 John 3:2; Rom. 8:19, 23; <em>Hymns,</em> #948, stanza 2.</li>

	<li>&ldquo;On God&rsquo;s side, the Triune God has been incarnated to be a man; on our side, we are being deified, constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God so that we may be made God in life and in nature to be His corporate expression for eternity. This is the highest truth, and this is the highest gospel&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Life-study of Job,</em> p. 122.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The genuine and intrinsic gospel is that God intends to work Himself in Christ into us&mdash;2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Rom. 1:1-4, 9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ builds the church by building Himself into us, making our heart, our intrinsic constitution, His home&mdash;Eph. 3:16-19.</li>
	<li>If we preach this gospel, we will tell others that they need Christ, the very God Himself, to be wrought into their being&mdash;v. 17a; John 14:23.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s world needs a crusade with the preaching of the highest and fullest gospel&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Life-study of Hebrews,</em> p. 157.</li>
