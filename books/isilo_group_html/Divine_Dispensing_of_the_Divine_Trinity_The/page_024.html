AS THE MEDIATOR OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<p>Christ is the Mediator between God and us, and He is also the Mediator of the new covenant, the new contract (Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24). This means that Christ is like an attorney who is always pleading our case before God. The Lord Jesus always wins our case before God. We have a good attorney. He wins the case for us, and He also protects God so that God can continue to flow into us. Our attorney has fully taken care of the case according to the contract which was sealed by His blood (Heb. 10:29).</p>
<h2 class="head1">17. AS THE AUTHOR AND PERFECTER OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Faith is the way to enjoy God, but we do not have faith in ourselves. Our faith can only last a short time. But Christ is the Author, the Originator, and the Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2). This means that He is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the ending, of our faith. In other words He is our faith, and this faith lasts forever. If you feel that your faith is weak, you had better call on the Lord&rsquo;s name: Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! After calling a few times you will have faith within you. Faith is nothing less than Christ Himself. He is the Author and Perfecter of our faith. When we have Him we have faith, and this faith is for God to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">18. AS THE GREAT SHEPHERD</h2>
<p>Christ is the great Shepherd of the sheep (Heb. 13:20). What is the difference between a shepherd and a priest or between a shepherd and a forerunner? None of the other titles is so tender as shepherd. The shepherd is very tender toward the sheep. We are God&rsquo;s flock, and this flock needs the shepherd. A shepherd takes care of all the needs of the flock. His main goal is to feed the flock. He does everything for the flock so that the flock may eat properly. This is the dispensing of life. The feeding on the grass is to receive the life supply, so the shepherd&rsquo;s business is to dispense life into the sheep. Our great Shepherd, Christ, feeds us with God as the green pasture. This is to dispense God&rsquo;s divine life into our being. Many Christians are familiar with Psalm 23 which says that the Lord is our Shepherd, but they may not realize that Christ is our Shepherd to dispense God into us as our nourishment so that we may have more of the divine life. This point has been neglected among the Christians. Our burden is to tell all the Christians today that the Lord Jesus shepherds us to feed us with God as our nourishment so that we may have more and more of the divine life dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">19. AS THE DIVINE RICHES</h2>
<p>The next item is the divine riches, the unsearchable riches, of Christ (Eph. 3:8). Paul said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ. Paul was not preaching mere doctrine. He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ so that all the believers might receive more of God, more of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">20. AS THE DIVINE LIFE</h2>
<p>By enjoying the divine riches, you have the divine life (Col. 3:4). The divine life is the first item of the divine riches which God dispenses into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">21. AS POWER AND WISDOM:<br />
RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br />
SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Whenever the divine life is dispensed into us, we have the power and wisdom, the righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). Christ is God&rsquo;s power and wisdom. When He is dispensed into us He becomes our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">22. AS THE FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>Christ is also the foundation (1 Cor. 3:11). We are not a floating people. We are a people founded on the solid foundation. I am not afraid of all the attacks of the opposing ones because I am solidly founded. I have a solid foundation, my Lord Jesus Christ. The more they attack, the more I enjoy the dispensing of God because I am on a solid foundation. Our standing is not sinking sand; our foundation is the solid rock. The Lord Jesus Christ is our foundation so that God may dispense Himself into us all the time in a solid way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
