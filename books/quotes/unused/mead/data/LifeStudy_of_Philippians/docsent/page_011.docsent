   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Far from being a discouragement, Paul s imprisonment was an encouragement, an encouragement to the brothers to speak the word of God without fear.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word translated in means into.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The use of this word here implies the organic union the believer has with Christ through believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To believe in Christ is to have our being merged into His that the two may be organically one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To suffer on behalf of Christ, after receiving Him and being made one with Him through believing, is to participate in, to have the fellowship of, His sufferings 3:10 , that we may experience and enjoy Him in His sufferings.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Participating in this enjoyment of grace with Paul for the furtherance of the gospel, the Philippian believers were one with Paul both in his suffering and in the enjoyment of grace.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Notice that verse 8 begins with the conjunction for.</S>
