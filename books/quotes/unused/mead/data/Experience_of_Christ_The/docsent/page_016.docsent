   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING THE SAME LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 2 we find not only the matter of the mind, but also the matter of the emotion, for love is a matter of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 2 Paul implores the Philippians to have the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, they were not only to think the same thing in their mind, but to have the same love in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many among us today do not have the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, our love for certain ones is on a higher level than our love for others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is especially true among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The love among the sisters is on different levels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They love certain ones more and others less.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that the sisters do not have the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To love the Apostle Paul above the other saints is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should love all the believers with the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul's word about having the same love is a weighty word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a strong indication that the Philippians had a love that was on different levels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our situation today is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yes, we love one another, but our love differs, and the temperature of our love is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we contact certain ones, we are like ice, but when we contact others, we are like boiling water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For some, our love is too cold; for others, it is too hot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our love should be moderate toward everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It should be neither too hot nor too cold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes people have told me that they love me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But within I said, "Your love is so cold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more you love me, the colder I become.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But your love for others is boiling hot."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To have a love that fluctuates in its temperature is to have a love that issues out of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a love comes from a soul that has not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can never enjoy Christ in this kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our love toward the saints has been regulated and dealt with, then we shall enjoy Christ as we love the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether or not our love is proper depends on whether or not we enjoy Christ in our loving of others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you love others without having the enjoyment of Christ in that love, your love is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is neither moderate nor proper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are you sure that your love for the saints is all on one level?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If not, then your love has honey in it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Honey was prohibited from being added to the meal offering because it could be easily leavened Lev 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be leavened means to be corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, our natural love is easily corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because there are no wasted words in the Bible, there must have been a reason for the Apostle Paul to write such a word as is found in Philippians 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have pointed out, Paul seemed to be saying, "Philippians, do you have any tender mercy toward me?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do, make my joy full by thinking the same thing, by having the same love, and by being one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you intend to sympathize with me in my sufferings for the gospel in prison?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you should not be so opinionated, and you should not be fighting against one another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This troubles me and hurts me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I beg you to think the same thing, to have the same love, and be one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you do this, you will fulfill my joy."</S>
