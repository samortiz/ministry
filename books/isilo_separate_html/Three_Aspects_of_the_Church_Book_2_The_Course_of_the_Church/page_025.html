<p>The fourth epistle was written to the church in Thyatira (vv. 18-29), which corresponds with the Roman Catholic Church. The church in Thyatira is full of idols, fornication, and the deep things of Satan (vv. 20, 24). The history of the Roman Catholic Church shows that in both practical and spiritual matters, Catholicism is full of idols, fornication, and the deep things of Satan. I am afraid that on this earth, Satan cannot find another place that has developed his thought as completely and thoroughly as the Roman Catholic Church. We could never describe all the idols, fornication, and heretical thoughts in Catholicism. In order to overcome, we must completely abandon the things of Catholicism.</p>
<p>In the epistle to Thyatira the matter of authority is emphasized. The Roman Catholic Church has an earthly position, but it has lost its authority before God. Therefore, anyone who leaves Catholicism and rejects the things of the Roman Catholic Church will be able to receive authority from God.</p>
<p>In the face of such desolation, we should leave everything that is apart from the Lord and everything related to Catholicism. We should return to the first love for the Lord. Then we will enjoy Christ as life and receive authority from the Lord. Prophetically, authority in verse 26 refers to reigning with the Lord; practically speaking, one who lives before the Lord has spiritual authority today.</p>
<p>According to the fourth epistle, a basic requirement for overcoming is to abandon the worldly things brought in by fallen Catholicism. Spiritually speaking, the worldly things are nothing more than idols and fornication. The principle of idolatry is to desire something other than God; the principle of fornication is to be united with something other than God. Thus, to be an overcomer, we must turn away from everything other than God and be for Him alone. Then we will enjoy the Lord as life and have His authority.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Rejecting Weakness (Death)</h2>
<p>The fifth epistle, to the church in Sardis (3:1-6), does not cover the matters for which Pergamos and Thyatira were condemned. The problem with the church in Sardis is that it is very weak (vv. 1-2), and this weakness has become its defilement (v. 4). Weakness defiles a church because weakness is the forerunner of death. Weakness taken to the extreme is death. Therefore, we must never sympathize with weakness. Death is the most defiling thing before God. In the Old Testament a person could offer a sacrifice to atone for the commission of a sin. However, a person who touched a corpse or anything dead was defiled and had to be separated for seven days before he could be cleansed (Num. 19:11-19). Strictly speaking, sin is not necessarily a defilement, because it is a matter of breaking God&rsquo;s law; death is the real defilement. To God, death is the dirtiest thing. The precursor of death is weakness; weakness is a sign of death. In God&rsquo;s eyes, weakness is equivalent to death. The church in Sardis had many works, but the works were weak and incomplete (Rev. 3:2).</p>
<p>Sometimes we taste the flavor of Sardis in the bread-breaking meeting; the hymn singing and prayer are not strong, and nothing is complete. Sometimes we taste the flavor of Sardis in the fellowship meetings; the testimonies and even the announcements are weak. The church in Sardis does not have idols, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, fornication, or the deep things of Satan, but whatever it has is weak. Sardis has everything, but everything is weak. Sardis has the table meeting, the prayer meeting, the message meeting, and the gospel meeting, but they are all weak. Everything is weak, lacking in life, vitality, freshness, and light; this is Sardis.</p>
<p>An overcomer is a person who is strong, living, shining, and fresh. He gives the impression that he is fresh and living, not outwardly but inwardly. He is up when everyone else is down; he rises up when no one else is able to rise up. He is living, shining, fresh, and strong whenever he opens his mouth. He is strong even in calling a hymn. His prayer in the meetings is strong. People do not touch weakness and death in him; instead, they touch something of life, something full and without lack. This is the fifth requirement of an overcomer.</p>
<p>We cannot merely hold to the so-called ground, way, or truth; we must be living, fresh, and strong. We should not focus on whether or not our actions are right, because they may be full of death. Rather, we should enliven others and make them strong inwardly. May the Lord have mercy on us and make us those who are living; these are the overcomers in Sardis.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
