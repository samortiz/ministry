Throughout the six thousand years of human history there have been countless writings of significant value in various fields, such as philosophy, science, and religion. Up to this day, however, in the whole world every person of integrity and fair-mindedness-whether he is a God-fearing person or an atheist, a Christian or a non-Christian-recognizes that the Bible is the most outstanding and profound book in human culture. The Bible, composed of sixty-six books, was written in various places (both Jewish and Gentile) by more than forty authors over a period of one thousand and six hundred years. In spite of this, the Bible is a complete book with a beginning and an end. It begins with God&#8217;s creation and concludes with the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. Moreover, it has a final warning which says that no one should either add anything or take away anything from the Word of God (Rev 22:18-19). Anyone who takes away any words from the Bible will lose the blessings of the eternal life of God-that person will have no share of the tree of life, the river of water of life, and the holy city. This punishment will be meted out to those who take away anything from the words of the Bible. Those who add something to the words of the Bible will also suffer the punishment of God&#8217;s eternal judgment, which is mainly to perish in the lake of fire. Hence, the Bible has an eternal beginning and an eternal ending.<p>Throughout the centuries innumerable Biblical scholars have studied the Bible according to the Hebrew language of the Old Testament and the Greek language of the New Testament by expending their energy over their entire lifetime and by using all the methods of their wisdom. However, up to the present no one has ever been able to claim that he has thoroughly studied the Bible. This shows that the Bible is truly mysterious. Hence, in addition to the ones who serve God full time for their whole life, even those who merely have a desire to follow the Lord faithfully must do their best to study and know the Bible.<p>When we studied in school, we spent a great deal of our effort to get into every subject thoroughly. However, I cannot find the proper words to express what kind of effort, energy, wisdom, knowledge, and understanding is needed for the study of the Bible. From what I have personally experienced in this matter, I can only affirm that I cannot express with human language what kind of effort and how much time we have to devote to the study of the Bible.<p>The division of the sections of the Bible is of profound significance, and even the arrangement of the books of the Bible inspires admiration. For example, according to the natural concept of the Chinese, who are particularly fond of maxims and mottoes, it would be best to have the book of Proverbs at the beginning of the Bible. However, the first book of the Bible is not Leviticus, still less Proverbs, the favorite book of the Chinese, but Genesis; moreover, the last book of the Bible is neither Matthew nor Isaiah but Revelation. If the sequence of the Bible were arranged according to man&#8217;s natural concept, then the proper significance would be lost. Therefore, the order of the books of the Bible has profound significance.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
