<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Following this, our Lord said something as a kind of explanation. It explained why He could say what He said. He said, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father" (v. 27a). As long as the Father knew, that was enough. It did not matter that the men of Chorazin knew not. It did not matter that the men of Bethsaida or Capernaum knew not. It did not matter that the whole house of Jacob and all the Israelites, including all those who received help from Him, knew not. It even did not matter whether John misunderstood Him. There was only one thing which was important: "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father." As long as the Father knew, that was enough. Brothers and sisters, God knows. Is that enough for you? Or do you need John to know or the whole house of Jacob and all the Israelites to know you? Do you need the men of Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin to know you? Brothers and sisters, is it enough for God to know you? It is true that you cannot be without your brothers and sisters, but when no one knows you, you should be satisfied with living before God and being known by the Father only.</p><p>The Lord Jesus could say, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father." Brothers and sisters, have all things been delivered to you by the Father? Or have all things been delivered to you by men? Can you say, "Father, everything I have is from You"? Can you say, "Father, I only want what is from You; I ask for nothing from men"? If you can say this, you can be at rest, and you can give praise.</p><p>The Lord said, "No one fully knows the Son except the Father." He also said, "Neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him" (v. 27b). Only those who are willing to be known by God alone will know God, and only those who know God can lead others to the knowledge of God. Those who do not know the Father cannot lead others to the knowledge of the Father. Brothers and sisters, have you ever tried to help others and lead others to the knowledge of the Father? Why does your word not carry weight or move others? It is because what you have is not from the Father only. You feel that what you have from the Father is not enough; you are not content with what the Father has delivered to you. You still hope to gain something from men. If you are such a person, you cannot say that you are known by no one except the Father. Brothers and sisters, is it enough that you are known by God alone? If it is truly enough, then everything is all right. If you are satisfied with being known by God alone, you will know God. Only those who are known by God will know God, and only those who know God can lead others to the knowledge of God.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if we are far from God, we cannot know Him. We do not know God because we care too much for human affection and are too weighed down by many things. We cannot lead others to the knowledge of God because we have received too much comfort and glory from men. If our heart is filled with all kinds of things apart from God, we will not know God. We have to remember the Lord's word, which says, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him." Brothers and sisters, if we drop all the things that are in our heart, we will know Him, and we will be able to lead others to the knowledge of Him; our heart will be pure, and those who have a pure heart will see God (Matt. 5:8).</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>After the Lord said this, He gave us a very comforting word: "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light" (11:28-30). Our Lord showed us His own experience. He left us with a pattern and showed us how He found rest so that we can find rest also.</p><p>"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." Brothers and sisters, do you feel a heavy burden on you? Are you struggling day and night? Do you feel unhappy in your heart? The Lord is speaking to you, "Come. Come to Me, and I will give you rest." Do you have many worries? Do you have many burdens which you cannot bear? Are you grieving over your many failures? The Lord says to come to Him, and He will give us rest.</p><p>How does the Lord give us rest? He places Himself in front of us so that we can see His pattern. He says, "I am meek and lowly in heart." What is being meek? A brother once illustrated meekness this way: "Meekness is like the flax bumper on the side of the steamer boats. When a steamer comes close to the pier, if there is nothing between the hard boards of the boat and the hard poles of the pier, one of the two will break. But if flax bumpers are placed in between them, both will hit the bumpers only, and nothing will break." Brothers and sisters, this is meekness. If both sides are hard, neither side should touch the other. But if something soft is put between them, both sides will be preserved. Others may be hard, but if you are soft, you can withstand any bumping; they can bump as much as they like. The Lord said that He is meek. This means that He can withstand any bumping. Brothers and sisters, are you meek? You often want to have something, and you will not give up until you have it. You insist on having what you want, and no power can change you. Even God cannot change you. This is not being meek. What is being meek? Being meek is being changeable; it means taking what God wants you to take. It means being satisfied when you have something and being equally satisfied when you do not have something. When you have it, you can sing hallelujah and praise the Lord. When you do not have it, you can also sing hallelujah and praise the Lord. Being meek is being pliable enough to allow God to change your decision according to His will. Brothers and sisters, can God's will change your will? Can you change your decision, your desire, your hope, and your pursuit when God disapproves of them? You confess that God loves you, but when He does not give you what you want, will you be satisfied? Can you sing hallelujah? Brothers and sisters, a meek heart is an obedient heart. Being meek is not insisting on one's own will, not persisting with one's own proposals, and not demanding what one wants. A meek person changes when God changes and turns when God turns. Whatever God wants to do, he agrees. Whoever is like this will find rest.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, rest is precious. Many Christians live on earth without any rest; they are frequently dissatisfied and always complaining. This is their condition because they always have unfulfilled demands and desires. The Lord showed us, however, that the condition for rest is meekness. Sometimes God's way is in conflict with our way. If we are willing to turn, we will say, "God, I yield." If we do not yield, we are not meek. Brothers and sisters, we must be meek. If our heart is not meek, we cannot find rest. We must remember that meekness is the first condition for rest.</p><p>The Lord Jesus was not only meek but also lowly in heart. We often have wild thoughts and fleshly desires. We have vain hopes and fruitless schemes. We often compare ourselves to other brothers and sisters, and we are not happy when they are ahead of us; we want to be taller and greater than they are. Our thoughts are filled with pride and boasting. We are not lowly in heart, and we are not like the Lord Jesus. Our Lord is meek and lowly in heart. His eyes are not haughty, and He never hopes to gain anything for Himself. He is willing to accept everything from God. He can say that it is enough, and He is satisfied. This is being meek and lowly in heart. Brothers and sisters, are you satisfied with what God has given you? Or do you constantly covet more and greater things? Is God's provision enough for you? Or do you insist on your way concerning certain things and affairs? Brothers and sisters, God is after those who are lowly in heart. Many people have great ambitions and aspirations, but these things do not count in God's eyes, and God cannot use such ones. They are not lowly in heart, and they do not have rest. They do not have any rest because they are not satisfied with what God has given them.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, can your decisions be changed? Can you change your mind and drop your proposals and your hope for God's sake? If you are ambitious and aspiring and if you are always after this thing and that thing, you are not meek and lowly in heart. A meek person accepts whatever God gives him. He can say hallelujah and praise the Lord for whatever He gives him. Our Lord Jesus is meek; He is pliable before God. Our Lord Jesus is also lowly in heart; He does not demand anything for Himself. Only those who are meek can be led by God, and only those who are lowly in heart can satisfy God's desire.</p><p>The Lord said, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me...and you will find rest for your souls." The Lord's own experience shows us that we have to take His yoke and learn from Him in order to find rest. Our biggest problem is that we often despise God's will. As a result, we find no rest for our soul and are not joyful. There are two kinds of joy in the Bible. One is the joy of believing in God's grace. The other is the joy of obeying God's will. We have believed in God's grace, but are we willing to obey His will? Brothers and sisters, is there any unhappiness in our heart? Is there any dissatisfaction in us? Are we murmuring against something which is contrary to our wish? If any of these things are in us, it means that we have not submitted to God's will. All those who have some experience can testify that nothing is more joyful than consecration, and nothing brings more happiness than placing oneself in the Lord's hand and under His direction. If we are not joyful and satisfied in heart, the only possible reason for this is that we have not taken the Lord's yoke and learned from Him. This kind of joy is a deeper joy, in which everything we have is delivered to us by the Father, and we can say, "Yes, Father, whatever You decide is the best." This is what we see from our Lord's experience.</p>
