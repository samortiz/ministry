   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEITHER YES NOR NO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider the case of the blind man in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus passing by saw this man blind from his birth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And His disciples asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>9:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The disciples' question was entirely religious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the man was blind, they reasoned, someone must have sinned, either he or his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents" v. 3 . If you read the Gospel of John carefully, you will see that people frequently came to Jesus with questions requiring a yes or no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Jesus never answered yes or no. He always said in effect, "Neither yes, nor no." For example, the Samaritan woman in chapter 4 introduced the matter of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain: and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship" v. 20 . But the Lord Jesus replied, "Neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father" v. 21 . The Lord's answer to His disciples in chapter 9 was of a similar nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus never answers yes or no; He always answers according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Him, it is not a matter of right or wrong, yes or no, good or evil, or anything of the tree of knowledge; it is entirely a matter of God, a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus told His disciples, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him" v. 3 . The question of the disciples was one of religion; the answer of the Lord Jesus was one of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus took away the veil of religion: He said in effect, "Forget about religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a matter of this or that, but a matter of the work of God being manifested."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>DIVINITY MINGLES WITH HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus spoke very little after this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately following this statement of His we read that He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle v. 6 . Scientifically and culturally speaking, spittle is a very dirty substance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord Jesus spat on the ground and even mixed the spittle with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, with this spittle, we read, the Lord anointed the eyes of the blind man and told him to go and wash.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did, and he returned healed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus in performing this sign acted not in a miraculous way, but in an uncultured, unrefined way, totally contrary to human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People would say that what He did was coarse and foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who would ever think that the Lord Jesus would use spittle mingled with dirt, of all things, as a kind of ointment to anoint a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Lord is always acting contrary to our religious and human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Spiritually speaking, what He did is full of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Something out of the mouth of the Lord was mingled with something of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, what the Lord did signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were all born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In what way did we receive sight?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By being mingled with the Lord Jesus as a divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some element of Christ must enter into us and be come mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most of us can testify from our experience: the day we received Christ was the day we received our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even today, there is no other way to receive sight, but by the mingling of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let Christ put something of Himself into you, and you will receive sight.</S>
