<h1 class="series">SECTION FOUR<br />CONFERENCE IN AMOY,<br />OCTOBER 1936</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">FOOT-WASHING</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 13, 1936, evening <br />Place: Amoy<br />Scripture Reading: John 13:1-17</h1><p>During the past few days, I have been considering foot-washing in John 13. Some time ago when Brother Luk was in Shanghai we read this portion of the Word together. We felt that the most difficult aspect to understand was the Lord's word concerning the necessity of foot-washing. Our familiarity with this passage has not made it easier for us to understand its real meaning. At the same time, since there are so many interpretations of this passage already, it is difficult to receive new light. For this reason, we felt that it was necessary to thoroughly study this passage once more. However, we still did not understand it well because we were too familiar with the interpretation of this passage. Later, I set aside the interpretation that I knew and came to the Word in a fresh way, as if I had never read it before. Thank the Lord that He granted me some light, and this chapter became a blessing to me. Last Lord's Day I spoke about it in Shanghai. Tonight I will speak some more about it.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BACKGROUND OF THE LORD'S WASHING<br />OF THE DISCIPLES' FEET</h2><p>This chapter speaks of the Lord's washing the disciples' feet and of His commandment for the disciples to wash each others' feet. First, we must ask: When did the Lord wash the disciples' feet and when did He charge the disciples to wash each others' feet? The Bible carefully records the history and the background of this incident. This information is very important. Let us consider this passage verse by verse.</p><h2 class="head2">The Hour Having Come to Depart Out of<br />This World unto the Father</h2><p>Verse 1 says, "Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come for Him to depart out of this world unto the Father..." The Lord's washing of the disciples' feet happened before the Passover. The Lord said that the "hour had come for Him to depart out of this world unto the Father." If I were to depart out of this world unto the Father tonight, what would I do? I might have to clear my debt with my co-workers or to the sisters, or I might have other important things to take care of. I would have to settle all the unsettled matters. If I know that I will not depart from this world for five years, I may postpone these things until later. But if I know that I am about to depart from this world, I will surely settle and conclude all of my important business. I would surely not be concerned with insignificant matters, such as asking a child to go to the store and buy me some candy or going to a movie. Instead, I would do crucial and necessary things. This was true of the Lord. Before He departed from the world unto the Father, He washed the feet of His disciples, that is, His students, and charged them to wash one another's feet. There were many things in this world that He could have done at that time, but He chose to wash the disciples' feet. This shows that foot-washing is a very crucial matter.</p>
