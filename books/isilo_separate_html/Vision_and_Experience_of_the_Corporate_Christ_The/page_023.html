REVEALED IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>As the divine revelation, the Bible tells us that God has a desire. God&rsquo;s desire is to dispense Himself and work Himself into us to be our life, our nature, and everything to us so that we could live our human life in a divine way. This is God&rsquo;s purpose. For this purpose, He created the heavens and the earth, because without the heavens the earth could not exist, and without the earth man could not exist. The Bible reveals that the heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for mankind. God&rsquo;s intention is not to have merely the heavens and the earth but to have the human race so that He could select a group of people and dispense Himself into them as their life, nature, and everything. These human beings can live a divine life, expressing not themselves but the unique Divine Being. Thus, the heavens, the earth, and the human race are for God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD MAKING MAN AS A VESSEL<br />
TO CONTAIN HIM</h2>
<p>Let us consider the composition and design of a human being, which are truly amazing. We are composed of many wonderful parts. First, we have a wonderful body. There is no end to describing the wonders of our body. Without such a wonderful living machine, we could not live.</p>
<p>In addition to our body, we have a spirit and a psychological heart. Jeremiah 17:9 says, &ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?&rdquo; This verse and Ephesians 3:17 must refer to the psychological heart. God made a spirit, a soul, and a body (1 Thes. 5:23). Our heart includes our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and our conscience, which is part of our spirit (Heb. 4:12; John 16:22; Acts 11:23; Heb. 10:22).</p>
<p>Even if people are rich in material possessions, unless they have God, they will still have the feeling, the deep sense, that they are hungry and that they are missing something. Such a hunger is in the heart and in the spirit. Only God can satisfy the hunger in our spirit and our heart.</p>
<p>Worldly &ldquo;water&rdquo; cannot satisfy us. The Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again&rdquo; (John 4:13). The more we drink &ldquo;this water,&rdquo; the more our thirst will increase. A young man may think that he will be satisfied if he can find a good wife. A student may think that he will be satisfied if he can earn a Ph.D. Others think that they will be satisfied if they can become rich. However, more money only increases our thirst; it can never fill the gap within us. The spirit and the heart were created by God and for God. God made us with a body for our existence, with a heart for loving Him, and with a spirit for receiving Him. For this reason, when God saves us, He gives us a new heart and a new spirit. Ezekiel 36:26 says, &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every human being is a vessel, with a body, a heart, and a spirit, made by God to contain God (Rom. 9:21, 23). Those who do not know God also do not know themselves. They do not know that they have a heart and a spirit. We have a heart to desire and love God and a spirit that is able to take God in. Thus, we need to exercise the deepest part of our being, our spirit, to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Every time we do this, God comes into us. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING PROCESSED<br />
TO DISPENSE HIMSELF INTO US</h2>
<p>Now we will see how God can be worked into us. A process is required in order for God to be able dispense Himself into us. As a simple illustration, imagine a large watermelon full of sweet juice. Suppose that my purpose is to work this watermelon into you. In order to do this, I would first cut the watermelon into slices. To make the watermelon even easier to take in, a further step is needed. I would extract all the watermelon juice from the slices. Then anyone could drink the delicious juice. Thus, the watermelon passes through three forms or stages: melon, slices, and juice. By passing through this process, the watermelon can easily be dispensed into many people. Once the watermelon is received in this way, it becomes the constituent of those who take it in.</p>
<p>Grains of wheat are raw, but a loaf of bread has been processed. Many grains are ground into flour, blended with water and oil, and baked to become an edible loaf. Today Jesus is no longer &ldquo;raw.&rdquo; He was processed by being incarnated and dying on the cross. His crucifixion can be likened to being baked in an oven. Eventually, He came out of the &ldquo;oven&rdquo; in resurrection, and as the Spirit He is our heavenly food. This is the essence of today&rsquo;s gospel. God&rsquo;s gospel today includes forgiveness of sins, but the essential part of the gospel is that God has presented Himself as food to be dispensed into us. For this reason, Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life...He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (6:48, 57).</p>
<p>God is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The trinity of the Godhead is not mainly for teaching or doctrine but for His process and for His being dispensed into us. On the one hand, a watermelon, its slices, and its juice are all one thing; on the other hand, they are three. They are three in one. They are three for the purpose of dispensing. If the watermelon were only one large melon, it would be difficult for anyone to take it in. For a large melon to be dispensed into us, it needs to exist in three stages or three forms&mdash;melon, slices, and juice. When it becomes juice, it can be dispensed into us. When the juice is dispensed into us, the slices and the whole melon also are dispensed into us. If we receive the juice, we receive the slices and the melon also. We may say that God the Father is the melon, God the Son is the slices, and God the Spirit is the juice. The Spirit is for our drinking (1 Cor. 12:13). If we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and if we have the Son, we have the Father. This is for dispensing. God is dispensing Himself into us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
