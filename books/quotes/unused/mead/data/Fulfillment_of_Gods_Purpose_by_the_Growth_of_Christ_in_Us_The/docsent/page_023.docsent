   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX GROWING UP INTO CHRIST IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 4:15 says that we have to grow up into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would ask you to consider this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In how many things have you grown up into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe it is necessary for us to go to the Lord and stay in His presence to write a list of all the items of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Write down all the items of what you are, of what you do, of what you think, of what you have, and of what you use.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It may be that you would write down more than a few hundred items to be considered in the light of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GROWING UP INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN OUR MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you grown up into Christ in your thinking?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have Christ within you, in your spirit, but your mind may still be far away from the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your mind may be separated from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have Christ within your spirit, but your mind has nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This simply means that you have not grown up into Christ in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your thinking is still not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not mean that you are wrong in your thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You might be absolutely right, but you are not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Right and wrong are both of the same category; they are both of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With us, the seeking ones, it is not a matter of being right.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It must be a matter of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With us, to be in Christ is right.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bring this matter to the Lord and see how much you need to grow into Christ in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now consider your emotion, another part of your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have Christ in your spirit, but your emotion is still insulated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to say a word to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we say that we do not want to be bound; we want to be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is absolutely right, but on the other hand, you have to check is Christ in your emotion, or do you just have your emotion liberated?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may think that they are in the local church where they are absolutely liberated and can do everything that they like.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a sense, there is no restriction in the local church, but there is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can you say that when you are so excited, Christ is within your emotion to be excited together with you?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to grow up into Christ in your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our meetings we surely need to be released in our praising and singing, but we have to be sure that when we sing the hymns, Christ is singing within our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to be sure that when we are so released, Christ is released.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The young people may be excited, but they have to be sure that they have Christ in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do not have Christ in your emotion and are shouting, that is looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to be spiritual we need to be emotional, but we need to be spiritually emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means to be emotional with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must have the assurance that Christ is in your emotion and that your emotion is not insulated from Christ, but connected and mingled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church life is a life of the saints mingled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anything we do must be with Christ mingling with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not have the assurance that Christ is doing something with us, we have to be a little careful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should go to the Lord and ask Him, "Lord, in this matter, are You in my emotion?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only in the meetings but also in our daily life we should not be dumb believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to be the ones who call on the name of the Lord in every place 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in our calling there must be Christ calling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must have the assurance that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He is calling within our calling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, we will have too much looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is not something of the Spirit nor is it the release of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is the release of something else.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is wrong and will give people a bad impression.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So we have to be balanced and fair.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Surely we should not be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why we do not like to restrict anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet we need to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to be in the spirit with the assurance that we have Christ in the things we do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of course, this needs the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to grow into Christ in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we need to consider our will, another part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to grow into Christ in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That means our will has to be saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to grow into Christ in making any kind of decision.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we make a decision, we should not make it by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to open ourselves in our will to Christ and let Christ come into our will to take full possession of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we will make a decision by using our will with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We will have the assurance to say that Christ is one with us in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The mind, emotion, and will are big items.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now let us consider some small items.</S>
