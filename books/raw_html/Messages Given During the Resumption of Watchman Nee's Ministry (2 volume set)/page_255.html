<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A TRANSPARENT PERSON</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (6)</H1><P>Date:10:00 a.m., The Lord's Day, May 16, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:9, 17; John 9:39-40; Eph. 3:16-19</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RIGHT AND WRONG BRINGING IN DARKNESS</H2><P>Last Lord's Day, at the end of the message, we mentioned the matter of avoiding right and wrong, but we did not explain the matter clearly. Any time we fall into right and wrong, we fall into darkness. Suppose two brothers are arguing, and the matter is brought to you. If you consider the matter from the angle of right and wrong, you will immediately fall into darkness, and you will not be shining and transparent. Immediately you will be veiled. You may not be confusing rights with wrongs, but you will be in darkness.</P><P>The mind is something good in man. The emotion is also something good in man. If a man is void of emotion, he will be a piece of wood. The will is also a good thing. Without the will, a man will be like a ship without a rudder. But if a man lives by these three things, he will be living in darkness. The mind itself is dark, and it is not transparent. The mind, the emotion, and the will can be compared to a metal barrel. If a man is put into a barrel, he will not be able to come out. Although he may not be dirty, yet he is in darkness. All the gentlemen and moral persons are very clean, but at the same time they are very dark. They have a keen sense of right and wrong. Those who do not have any spiritual discernment will say that they are excellent and proper. But those who have spiritual discernment will sigh and will pity such persons. There is a big difference between a man living in his moral behavior and one who is living in the light. Here is a person who is most clean, and he is germ-free, yet he lives inside a metal barrel. Here is another person who perhaps has some dirt or germs with him, but he lives under the sun. Which of the two would you say is living in the light?</P><P>If two persons are fighting with one another, and they come before you, you should not deal with the matter according to right and wrong. You should turn to your inner being and should exercise your judgment before God and touch their spirit with your spirit. A judge is only concerned about the legal arguments of matters; he is not concerned about the matters themselves. However, we must not be concerned with the arguments only, but we must touch the matters themselves, and even more, we must touch others' spirit. Perhaps a person is very justified in his arguments, but his spirit is not proper. Perhaps here is another person who, as far as right and wrong are concerned, may not have as many arguments on his side as the other one, yet his spirit is quite proper. In touching all the various matters involved, our purpose is to touch others' spirit. The purpose of our helping others is to make their spirit clean, proper, and strong. For this reason, many times, the discernment of many who know God becomes the source of misunderstanding for those who do not know God. Those who do not know God will say, "Clearly this one has the argument. Why is he wrong?" He is wrong not because he has the wrong argument, but because he has the wrong spirit. If you agree with him, you will put him into further darkness. Every time someone brings a matter before you, you should bring this person before God and touch God. If you do this, you are transcending, rising above the people, the matters, and the arguments; you are putting yourself into their spirit to touch their spirit. If you want to be a transparent person, you will have to learn to touch others' spirit with your spirit.</P>
