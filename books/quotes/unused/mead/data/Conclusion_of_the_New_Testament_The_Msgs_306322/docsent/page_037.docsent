   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s Shining in the Illumination</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Gospel of the Glory of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christ of glory as the excellent treasure is received by the believers through the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to remember that we have within us the treasure, a living person who is more excellent than the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the most excellent One in the whole universe; there is nothing that is more excellent than He.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we have Christ as the treasure, the most excellent One and the most lovely One, we do not love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not that we should not love the world but that the world is inferior to the treasure, the excellent and lovely Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We treasure the Lord more than the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of Christ, has shined on us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gospel of the glory of Christ in 4:4 corresponds with the knowledge of the glory of God in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to note that according to verse 6 the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God is in the face of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the gospel preached by the apostle was not a doctrine, theology, or teaching; rather, it was a lovely person on whose face we can see the glory of God, the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we experience the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ, this shining brings into us Christ as the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are attracted to such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 That the Excellency of the Power May Be of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul goes on to say that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word for excellency also means transcendence, surpassingness, and exceeding greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fact that we are earthen vessels proves that the excellency of the power is of God and not out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In ourselves we are nothing more than earthen vessels; we are sinful, fallen, and low.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As such, we do not have the power to manifest the truth and shine forth the glory of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The excellency of the power is not out of us it is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we are worthless earthen vessels, God has shined this precious treasure into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now this treasure becomes the source of the power energizing us and enabling us to shine forth God s glory and to manifest the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to see that Christ as the marvelous treasure in earthen vessels empowers and energizes us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He supplies us continually with the excelling power through His dispensing, thereby constituting us, the worthless and weak vessels, as ministers of a new covenant 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As believers, we have Christ operating within us as a living and active treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This treasure even constrains us to do certain things 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This treasure is the power, the source of strength, for the apostles to behave themselves in such a way as to shine the gospel and manifest the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are the earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These vessels are like today s camera, into which Christ the figure enters through the flash of God s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The shining reality of Christ is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Outwardly we are earthen vessels, but inwardly we have a priceless treasure Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This treasure has a power, and this power is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit in us is the One who shines and works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the treasure we have in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Within us, we have Christ as an excellent treasure; outside us, we bear Christ as the image of God, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the effulgence of God s glory; that is, He is the expression of the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received more than simply a Redeemer; we received the most excellent One, the highest excellence, in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through the shining of the gospel, Christ was illuminated into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now Christ, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God, is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within us, Christ is the excellent treasure; outside us, He is the image, the expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Daily we need to experience and enjoy Christ as the treasure within and the image of God without.</S>
