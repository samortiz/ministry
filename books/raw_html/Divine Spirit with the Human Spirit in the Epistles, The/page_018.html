<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF THE SON OF GOD<br />
BEING SENT INTO OUR HEARTS FOR OUR SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Galatians 4:4-5 says, &ldquo;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law, that He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.&rdquo; Verse 5 does not say that God sent forth His Son to redeem us so that we may go to heaven. This is the incorrect gospel that many Christians preach. Rather, Christ redeemed us that we might receive the sonship. Verse 6 continues, &ldquo;And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo; The way we know that the Spirit of the Son of God has been sent into us is that there is a cry within us. For us to cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; is a proof that we have the Spirit of the Son of God. Before we believed in Christ, we could not cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; However, after we believed in Jesus, there was immediately a desire within us to cry to God in this way. Now the more we cry in this way, the more we have the sweetness within. This proves that the Spirit of the Son of God has been sent into us. After our new birth by the Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God is within us.</p>
<p>Someone may wonder whether or not he has the Spirit ofthe Son of God within him. Once a classmate of Brother Watchman Nee asked him, &ldquo;How can I know that I am a child of God and that I have the Spirit of the Son of God?&rdquo; Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;I know that you are married. The first time yousaw your father-in-law, were you able to call him &lsquo;Father&rsquo; with a sense of sweetness?&rdquo; The classmate answered that he was reluctant to address him in such a manner. Brother Nee asked, &ldquo;Have you ever called your own father &lsquo;Father&rsquo; in a reluctant way?&rdquo; The classmate replied that it was always with gladness that he called his father &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; The reason he could not call his father-in-law &ldquo;Father&rdquo; was that this man was not his actual father. God is our Father, not our &ldquo;Father-in-law.&rdquo; We do not call him Father reluctantly but willingly and with much gladness. Especially when we face troubles and hardships, we come to God, crying, &ldquo;O Father! Abba, Father.&rdquo; The more we call Him in this way, the more comfort and sweetness we sense within. This is a strong proof that we have received the Spirit of the Son of God within us. We areborn of the Spirit, and the Spirit of the Son has come into us crying, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; Now this all-inclusive, wonderful, marvelous, and rich Spirit is within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BORN ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Verse 29 says, &ldquo;Just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.&rdquo; This verse speaks of our birth by the Spirit. When the Spirit came to us, we received Him in the way of birth; that is, He came into us to regenerate us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING CHRIST EXPRESSED IN US<br />
THROUGH OUR WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Verses 22 and 23 of chapter 5 say, &ldquo;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&rdquo; All of these items are not different kinds of fruit. Rather, verse 22 speaks of &ldquo;the fruit,&rdquo; singular in number. The fruit isone, but the aspects of this fruit are many. The one fruit is Christ expressed through us by the Spirit. These verses list nine items, but there are many more than nine aspects of the one fruit. Lowliness, humility, tenderness, purity, godliness, and holiness are all not listed here. This proves that these nine items are not all-inclusive. They are simply examples of the aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, which is Christ expressed in us.</p>
<p>Verses 16 through 18 say, &ldquo;But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.&rdquo; Verse 25 continues, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; After being born of the Spirit, and after the Spirit has come into us, we simply need to walk in Him. To walk includes many matters. All that we do and speak and even our entire being must be in this Spirit. As we have life in this Spirit, so we must also walk in Him.</p>
<p>The Spirit has regenerated us, and He is now dwelling in our spirit. Therefore, we simply need to learn one thing, that is, to constantly walk in Him and do everything in Him. Then spontaneously we will bear fruit. To bear fruit is not a work carried out by a branch. Rather, it is the outworking of the inner life within the branch. When we walk in the Spirit, live in the Spirit, and sow unto the Spirit, this indwelling Spirit produces fruit. This fruit is the outworking of the inner Spirit in many aspects as the expression of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RESTORING A BROTHER IN A SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS</h2>
<p>Verse 1 of chapter 6 says, &ldquo;Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted.&rdquo; Even when we do the good work of restoring a fallen brother, we must do it not in our self or soul but in our spirit. Then we will be a spiritual person. All of the verses mentioned above prove that after we are born again in our spirit and the Holy Spirit comes into us, we must walk, live, and do everything in the spirit.</p>
