   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ministering the Word Being to Enjoy God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me use myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I began serving the Lord, the most difficult thing for me to do was to minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I had difficulty selecting a subject from the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I did not know which subject to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Should I speak on Adam and Eve or on Peter and James?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Should I speak on love and humility or on light and holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There were too many subjects, and this was a real problem to me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even after I selected a subject, I worried about the content.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How should I begin, and how should I end?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How should each section be developed, and what examples should I use?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I struggled with these points.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I could not come up with the right idea, I would pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This seemed to be the Christian thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, as soon as I knelt down and asked the Lord about a subject, my mind started to spin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Should the subject be heaven or hell, the cross or the manger, Jerusalem or Samaria?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such thoughts came all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Should I speak from Genesis, Exodus, Revelation, the Gospel of John, or Acts?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My mind was full of subjects, but the Lord could not be found.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was often unclear even after half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the end, I would simply select a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But once I had the subject, I started worrying about the content and would pray again, saying, Lord, what should the first sentence be?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What should the last word be?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How should I divide the message into various parts?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since I was afraid of forgetting the points, I also prayed, Lord, help me to remember all the points.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While I was praying, I was occupied with these things; hence, I did not touch the Lord at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When it was time to deliver the message, I was in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result was often complete failure, and I would be totally devastated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later I would wonder why the Lord did not answer my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I suffered this agony for many years, but no one was there to help me find the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After painfully searching for approximately ten years, I gradually found the key in the course of my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I found out that my experience of prayer was not prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Prayer is to absorb God and to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us again consider the matter of ministering the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When praying concerning giving a message, there is no need to worry whether the message should be on Genesis, Revelation, the manger, or the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is also no need to worry about what to say first and what to say second.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need to worry about any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to go to the Lord to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should forget about the message and the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should simply contact and touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we contact Him, He will give us a sense that there may be problems, obstacles, and barriers between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We might be blaming others, holding grudges, or jealous of others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There may be other barriers between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should deal with these barriers and remove them item by item through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we can worship Him and, beholding His beauty in His presence, we can pray: Lord, You are altogether lovely and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You are my life and my strength.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are my word and my subject.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we fellowship with Him this way, we not only stop praying for the message, but we also forget about the message.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are fully enjoying the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are connected to Him in the same way that a light bulb is connected to the power source.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as we are connected, electricity flows into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the way to pray for our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no need to worry about the subject or the content.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as we are connected to the Lord, touch Him, and have His presence within, we can stand because the Lord is in us as our enjoyment and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ministering the word in this way can be compared to branches of a tree bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Inwardly we are absorbing the Lord, and outwardly we are speaking the message.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what it means to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The prayer of the sister who asked for patience was wrong because patience was the subject of her prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All genuine prayers have God as the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no need to be concerned with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should simply spend time every day to contact God and to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we will be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we are filled with Him in this way, we may not think of the word patience at any time but nevertheless experience patience in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every situation will issue in joy because the God of joy fills our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can endure everything joyfully, and nothing will trouble or irritate us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Inwardly we will be watered and filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not even think of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although the word patience is not in our thoughts, and we do not speak of it, our daily life will be filled with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This patience comes from the God whom we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we absorb Him and enjoy Him, He becomes our patience, our life, and our inward constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We will be inwardly watered, satisfied, and cheered.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In whatever situation we encounter, there will be no need for us to exert any effort to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the contrary, patience will spontaneously be within us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This patience will not be the issue of our work; rather, it will be the living out of the God who lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We might not say anything concerning patience, but everyone will say that we are full of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the wonder of the Christian life.</S>
