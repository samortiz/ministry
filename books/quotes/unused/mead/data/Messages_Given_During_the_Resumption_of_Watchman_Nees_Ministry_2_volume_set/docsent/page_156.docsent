   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is exceedingly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the Christ in you, in me, and in another should also be very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, Christ is also dwelling in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the church should also be very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Old Testament, it says that one can drive away a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Logically speaking, two should then be able to drive away two thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is human addition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But God says that two can drive away ten thousand Josh 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is filled with Christ, and Christ is the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How rich is the Lord who dwells in the church!</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Triune God is now living among all of us, and He is walking among all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is different from living within one single individual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Church Being the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>for the Expression of the Riches of God</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the Body of Christ is God's dwelling place in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Chapter five says that Christ loves the church and gave Himself for her, for the purpose of gaining her Eph 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He could not gain the church, His death would have become a death in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through His death, the church came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is intimately related to the kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The purpose of the Lord's death was to secure a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Matthew also puts the church and the kingdom together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given to Peter Matt 16:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 9 speaks of a star that fell, to which is given the key of the shaft of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The things from the abyss come up and fill the earth, so that men have a taste of hell for five months and cannot find death even when they seek for it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is the meaning of the keys of the kingdom of the heavens given to Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It means that the things of the heavens should fill the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kingdom of the heavens is inseparable from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingdom of the heavens is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not brought in through you or me alone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a great thing as the kingdom can only be brought in by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>An eye or a hand alone cannot do much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today the church is here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All that there is in the kingdom of the heavens should be opened up and brought in by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord told Peter that the things in the kingdom of the heavens can be opened up to man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To open up the things in the kingdom of the heavens takes more than one individual's work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It takes the whole church to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Wherever there is the testimony of the church, Satan will use all kinds of means to attack it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among us, the Lord is expressing God's glory, His authority, and His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What a glory this is!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are here by ourselves, God will be limited by us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's intention is for the church to testify to the authorities in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason, Satan is attacking the church everywhere.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His hands would not help him to free his chin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, all day long he rebuked his eyes for being so careless as to let the chin be caught on the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no useless member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even the Head cannot say to any member, "I have no need of you."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord is after the whole Body today, and not just after individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This requires that we pay the greatest price to accomplish God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May God be merciful to us.</S>
