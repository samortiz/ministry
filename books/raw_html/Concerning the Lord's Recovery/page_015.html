<P>In the son, Isaac, we can see a person who inherited and possessed and enjoyed all the riches of God typified by the good land. The grandson of Abraham, Jacob, shows a person who was chosen and selected by God to a destiny, that is, to be transformed into a prince of God. By his natural birth he was a supplanter, a heel-holder. But such a one was transformed into a prince of God to execute God's government on this earth. This was fully represented by Joseph. Eventually Joseph as an annex to Jacob or Israel, the prince of God, reigned over the entire world and supplied them with food. So in this complete person you can see God's choosing, God's calling, God's redemption, and God's transformation to execute His government on this earth. The goal of all God's doing is to have man to express God.</P><P>With these nine great men you cannot see a clear view of God's expression until this transformed person, Israel, was reproduced manyfold so that his descendants formed a people. The people of Israel as a collective people were used by God to express Himself. God brought His people out of the tyranny and slavery in Egypt to Mount Sinai where they received the revelation to build up the tabernacle of God on this earth. After the tabernacle was completely built up, God's glory came down from the heavens in a visible way to dwell with man. Isn't this marvelous! On this earth there was a people among whom God had gained a dwelling place to express Himself in His expanded glory. Up to the end of Exodus God's expression was quite complete.</P><P>Consider how big the universe is. Within the universe there is a globe which is good for life. It is good for the vegetable life, the animal life, for the human life and even for the divine life to be expressed through the human life. Eventually in Exodus the divine life came and dwelt in its splendid glory among the human life, even visible to the human eyes. Again I say that by the end of Exodus God's expression on this earth was fully complete. And that expression was traveling. It traveled through the wilderness for at least thirty-eight years. A people on this earth did not live on anything from the earth. While they were traveling they lived on manna, something from the heavens. Early in the morning they gathered manna, and they drank of the living water that came out of the rock which followed them.</P><P>Among them there was the dwelling place of God. God dwelt in that tabernacle. and God overshadowed that tabernacle. In other words, God was fully expressed in that dwelling place among the human race on earth. From Exodus to Malachi there are still thirty-seven more books in the Old Testament. What is the content of those books? The content in the first stage was the tabernacle and in the second stage the temple. The tabernacle was a precursor of the temple. The tabernacle or the temple was the center of the history of these thirty-seven books from Leviticus to Malachi. And what was the tabernacle or the temple? That was the expression of God among the human race on this earth. It is so easy to remember the entire Old Testament. All you need to remember is nine great men plus the tabernacle and the temple. Eventually, those nine great men issued in God's dwelling place. This is the way to understand the Bible with a heavenly view. The Old Testament tells us about nine great men and a dwelling place of God. The dwelling place of God was just God's expression as an issue coming out of those nine great men.</P>
