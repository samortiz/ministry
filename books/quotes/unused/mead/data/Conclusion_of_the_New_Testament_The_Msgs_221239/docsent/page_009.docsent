   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. Having Lawsuits One against Another</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We read of another failure in the churches in 1 Corinthians 6:6.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Brother goes to law with brother, and this before unbelievers."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul fully disagreed with this and regarded it as a defeat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Going to secular law and filing a lawsuit against a brother is a matter of claiming our rights and of not being willing to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are soulish and fleshly, we shall always claim our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We shall not be willing to be wronged by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only when we live in the spirit are we willing to give in and not insist on our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we live a life by the mingled spirit, we shall not claim any rights for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reason we claim our rights is that instead of living by the mingled spirit, we live in the soul and in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the soulish life was prevailing and because the door was opened through the lusts of the flesh, there were lawsuits among the believers in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sequence is that first we have a soulish preference, then the lust of the flesh, and then the claiming of our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>J. Questioning the Apostle's Apostleship and Charging the Apostle with Being Crafty in Making Gain with Guile</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Corinthian believers also had the great failure of questioning Paul's apostleship and even charging the apostle with being crafty in making gain with guile 1 Cor 9:1-3; 2 Cor 12:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1 Corinthians 9:1 Paul vindicates his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He asks, "Am I not an apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are you not my work in the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul's apostleship gives him authority to deal with all the problems in Corinth, serious problems concerning the church life and its fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His handling of them is based not only on his teaching but also on the authority inherent in his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To deal with the situation, Paul must take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had questioned his apostleship and were in a chaotic situation, mostly due to the foolishness of their worldly wisdom, self-confidence, and pride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 3 Paul says, "My defense to those who examine me is this."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Corinthians were actually examining Paul; they were investigating him to determine whether or not he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a shame this was to them!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is just like children examining their father to see if he is a genuine father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2 Corinthians 12:16 Paul says, "I did not burden you, but being crafty I took you with guile."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what some Corinthians charged against the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They said he was crafty in making gain, indemnifying himself by sending Titus to receive the collection for the poor saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Paul did not burden the Corinthians, some of them were saying that he was crafty and took them with guile.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They said that Paul would not come himself but used Titus as a cover to indemnify himself while he hid behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were accusing Paul of being the one who actually collected the money through Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In their judgment, that was Paul's craftiness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, Paul sent more than one person with Titus to collect the money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did this in order to silence the defaming tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, even though Paul acted carefully and with forethought, some of the Corinthians still defamed him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We learn from Paul's experience that even though the saints may be honest, Satan is nonetheless crouching among them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan uses money to damage the situation between the ministering ones and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was the reason some of the Corinthians criticized Paul, accusing him of being crafty in money matters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who criticized Paul might have been greedy and lovers of money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This might have been the reason they accused Paul of being crafty.</S>
