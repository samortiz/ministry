   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRUCIAL ASPECTS OF GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this record of Jeremiah's speaking to Jehovah and Jehovah's speaking to Jeremiah, we see some crucial aspects of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nourished with the Divine Supply</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 15:16 Jeremiah says to Jehovah, "Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The joy and rejoicing of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, O Jehovah, God of hosts."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the word of God is good for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's word makes our heart joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is crucial here is the revelation that God's word is the divine supply as food to nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every kind of food has a nourishing element.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's word, the divine supply, surely contains the element of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This nourishment is related to the divine dispensing, to God's dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the word as our food, God is dispensing His riches into our inner being to nourish us that we may be constituted with His element.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Trees Planted by Water</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another aspect of God's economy is revealed in 17:7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah / And whose trust Jehovah is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>/ And he will be like a tree planted by water, / Which sends out its roots by a stream, / And will not be afraid when heat comes; / For its leaves remain flourishing, / And it will not be anxious in the year of drought / And will not cease to bear fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These verses indicate that we, the believers in Christ, are God's planted trees.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These verses also indicate that God is likened to water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has planted us by Himself as the river of water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is not only our food; He is also our drink, the water that goes along with the food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our drinking of God as water is also a matter of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As He dispenses Himself into us as water, God is supplying us with the rich element of His being that we may be constituted with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way, we human beings are constituted with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Enjoying the Fountain of Living Waters</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jeremiah 17:13 speaks of Jehovah as the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to His chosen people for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Stubborn Israel offended God to the uttermost, even forsaking Him as such a fountain of living waters 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God desires to be the fountain of living waters for us to drink that our thirst may be quenched and that we may be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to chapter seventeen, eventually the one who trusts in the very God who nourishes us and who waters us will enjoy Him as the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The food, the water, the very God, and the fountain of living waters all these are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, these are basic points of the divine thought concerning the carrying out of God's economy by His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As God accomplishes His economy by dispensing Himself into us, He is our food, our water, and our fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How marvelous it is that in a portion of the Word concerned with God's chastisement of His sinful and evil people, we have such a full picture of God's economy by His dispensing!</S>
