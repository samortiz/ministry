<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Want</H2><P>The last of the negative things in Philippians is what Paul describes as want (4:11). To be in want is to have a material need. Being short of the supply to meet a material or financial need may be a cause of serious concern. Such circumstances certainly are a negative thing which needs to be overcome.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br>AND THE WORD OF LIFE</H2><P>In 1:19 Paul says, "For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ." Then in verses 20 and 21 he speaks of magnifying Christ and of living Christ. To live Christ and magnify Him requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. But how can this bountiful supply be applied to us? The secret of experiencing this bountiful supply is in holding forth the word of life (2:16). As Paul was living Christ and magnifying Him, he was no doubt holding forth the word of life. This was the reason that even some among Caesar's household could be saved. They realized that Paul, a prisoner there in Rome, was holding forth the word of life. Paul's word in 2:16 indicates that the bountiful supply of the Spirit was applied to him because he was receiving the word of life.</P><P>From Ephesians 1:13 we have seen that the Spirit is inseparable from the Word and comes with the Word. If there is no Word, there can be no Spirit. But when there is the preaching of the Word, it will be possible for those who hear this preaching to receive the Spirit. Paul received the word of life. When the word of life entered into him, it became the bountiful supply of the Spirit which enabled him to magnify Christ and live Him.</P><P>In Philippians 1:20 Paul speaks of magnifying Christ and in 2:16, of holding forth the word of life. Actually, Christ is the word of life, and the word of life is Christ. Furthermore, in 2:13 Paul says that God operates in us "both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Yes, it is God who works in us and operates in us. But when this operating God is expressed, He is the word of life.</P><P>Unless we receive the word of life into our being, we shall not be able to hold forth this word, to magnify it, to manifest it. How can we magnify the word of life if the word has not come into us to be magnified? In order to hold forth the word of life, we must first receive the word of life into us. Take eating as an illustration. If a person does not eat properly for several days, his face will not have a healthy color. But if he daily receives a nourishing supply of food, his complexion will be healthy. It will be the expression of the nourishing food he has eaten, digested, and assimilated. The principle is the same with holding forth the word of life. The secret is to handle the Word in a proper way and thereby to receive the Spirit. The Spirit will then function in us as our living faith. In this way we shall overcome rivalry, vainglory, murmurings, reasonings, our own things, anxiety, and want. Then we shall be able to say with Paul, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me" (4:13).</P><P>Christ empowers us through the Word. Suppose you neglect the Word for several days. Will you still be empowered by Christ? Certainly not! Food empowers you only when you eat of it. Likewise, Christ empowers you only when you take the Word into your being. By taking in the divine element through the Word, we are empowered. Then we can do all things in Him who empowers us through the Word.</P><P>Paul concludes the Epistle to the Philippians by saying, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." It is important to realize that whatever we enjoy by receiving the Word eventually becomes the grace in our spirit. Once again we see that we need to contact the Word and receive it by prayer, exercising our spirit to pray-read the Word in order to be supplied with the Spirit. Receiving the Spirit through the Word, we shall have the faith to receive grace as our enjoyment. Then we shall have the experience of Christ with the enjoyment of the church life.</P>
