<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">MARTYRDOM</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading:Rev. 2&mdash;3</h1><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN SMYRNA</h2><p>Revelation is a book given by the Lord Jesus "to His slaves" (1:1). This is a book for slaves. It shows the slaves the things that must quickly take place. In this book on future events, two of the letters to the seven local churches speak of martyrdom. One is to the church in Smyrna and the other to the church in Pergamos. In the letter to Smyrna, there is not a word of rebuke. The word Smyrna means "myrrh" in the original language; it signifies suffering. Myrrh is a compound used to embalm the dead (John 19:39). It is very much related to death. The church in Smyrna, like its name suggests, is a suffering church. It is a church that suffers for the sake of Christ. The Lord commands this church, "Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life" (Rev. 2:10). Martyrdom, trial, persecution, and tribulation for ten days&mdash;these are the Lord's allotted portions for the church in Smyrna. In spite of the fact that the Lord allowed Satan to inflict all kinds of tribulation on His church, He put a limit to Satan's activities. "You will have tribulation for ten days." "Ten days" in the Bible signifies a very short time (Gen. 24:55; Dan. 1:12). It denotes a short period. This signifies that the sufferings which the post-apostolic church experienced were very brief.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS</h2><p>The church in Pergamos describes the condition that came immediately after the church in Smyrna. Although the suffering of Smyrna reversed the backsliding of Ephesus, the trend did not last for long. By the time of Pergamos, confusion came in again. The Lord says to the church in Pergamos, "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells" (Rev. 2:13). The throne is a symbol of authority. The place where Satan exercises his authority is the present world. The world is the place where Satan reigns (1 John 5:19; John 14:30). The Lord says that Pergamos dwells where Satan's throne is. This indicates that the church in Pergamos is in the world. What a pity that the church is dwelling in the place where Satan reigns! Under these circumstances the Lord boasts in His martyrs. He mentions the name of Antipas, His faithful witness. He says, "Antipas, My witness, My faithful one." The Lord expects His children to be like Antipas, faithful unto death. He wants them to hold fast the Lord's word even at the point of death. He wants them to be witnesses to His life.</p><p>In the previous letter to Smyrna, we find Satan casting some into prison. In this letter to Pergamos, we find persecutions, tribulations, and martyrdom in the dwelling place of Satan. According to the letter to Pergamos, Satan's persecution of the church always is concentrated in one area. Satan not only moves back and forth on the surface of the earth, as described in Job, but he is looking for those whom he can devour. He has his dwelling place, his own address. His address is where he carries out his persecution of the believers. Satan places his throne at places which are convenient for him to persecute the believers. He is setting up his throne in places where he conducts persecutions, that is, in places where he murders God's children. Satan can set up his throne in Rome, Lyon, or London, and direct his persecution from there.</p><h2 class="head1">MARTYRDOM BEING THE REQUIREMENT<br />FOR EVERY BELIEVER</h2><p>The Lord tells the church in Smyrna, "Be faithful unto death" (Rev. 2:10). This shows us that the Lord wants martyrs. Whenever a believer faces persecution or threats to his life, he has to take heed to the Lord's word, be faithful unto death, and be ready to sacrifice his very life. The Lord's requirement is nothing less than our very life.</p><p>In the church in Pergamos, where Antipas was about to be killed, there was one who was "faithful unto death." The Lord praises Antipas as "My witness, My faithful one" (2:13). It is interesting that for two thousand years, no one has known of this Antipas. His name is not mentioned in any other place in the Bible nor in history. But the Lord knows him and mentions him by name. A man who completely passed the notice of the worldly church was noticed by God. Man can ignore such a one, but the Lord never forgets. He speaks of him by name and points out his faithfulness. How precious is the death of the saints in the eyes of God! How the Lord cares for the martyrs who are martyred for His name's sake. The prefix anti means "against," and the root pas means "all men." In other words, when everyone was against the Lord, Antipas set himself against everyone. A martyr is one whom the Lord reckons to be faithful. We have to tell new believers that the Lord has shown us this fact: All believers should be ready to sacrifice their life for the Lord. Every believer should not only believe in Him but also expect to sacrifice his life for Him. Matthew 10:18 says, "And you will also be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles." Verse 21 says, "And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death." For two thousand years church history has been intimately linked to the world's hatred. Everyone who acknowledges the Lord's name is hated by men. He will be delivered to death. Being delivered to death does not necessarily mean dying. It means being prepared to die. Martyrdom is a requirement for everyone.</p><p>The Lord said, "Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do...fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear this One" (Luke 12:4-5). Satan can only kill the body; he cannot kill our soul and spirit. Therefore, we do not have to fear him. A sister was taken before a magistrate because of her faith. When the magistrate saw the smile on her face, he hit her. The sister said, "You can destroy my body, but you cannot destroy my soul and spirit. The peace within me gives me this smile." We have to tell new ones that many people have sealed their preaching with their blood. Men like Stephen, James, Mark, Matthew, Peter, Matthias, Andrew, Paul, Judas (the Lord's brother), Bartholomew, Luke, Barnabas, Timothy, and Ananias were all martyrs. We have to show new ones that a disciple of the Lord has to be faithful unto death.</p>
