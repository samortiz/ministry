   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UPON THE WORLD As Salt</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen, salt is used to kill corruption and leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where there is salt, there is no leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seed of the salt of the earth is sown in Matthew 5:13 and is developed in 1 Corinthians 5:7-8: "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses say that we should purge out the leaven and keep the feast with unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This simply means we should be the salt and not allow any leaven to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we need to read Ephesians 4:22-24: "That you have put off, as regards to your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit; and are renewed in the spirit of your mind, and have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the old man is a kind of corruption, and the new man is a kind of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the new man bears the righteousness and holiness of God, he is the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were the old man, but we have been renewed and transformed into the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we are no longer leaven corrupting others, but instead we are salt killing the corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As Light</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 5:14 says that we are the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This seed is developed in Philippians 2:15-16a: "That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life, for my boasting in the day of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seed of the Lord's disciples being the light of the world reaches its fullest development in Revelation 1:20: "The mystery of the seven stars which you have seen on My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are seven churches."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse shows us not merely a small lamp but a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 5 there is only a small lamp, but in Revelation 1 there are seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the full development of our being light to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 2:5 says, "Remember therefore whence you have fallen and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse also shows that Christians as the church must eventually be a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 5 there is merely a lamp; in Revelation there is the full development of the lampstands shining in the darkness.</S>
