We are all happy because at this time we have representatives from the churches in all the six continents of the world
Near the place where the church in Anaheim is located, there is a Pentecostal group with a comparatively large congregation
Thirteen days ago, on a Lord's Day evening, they spent two and a half hours in a conference specifically to propagandize against us
Immediately ten of the brothers picked up the burden to take the sixteen points opposing us and write a refutation for each one
It is because every single point of their opposing words in those two and a half hours concerns our subjective experience
They say, 'The local church teaches this heresy, saying that man can be uplifted, can progress, and can even evolve into God'
Brothers and sisters, do you realize that this is an extremely great opposition and that it is a great contending against the truth?
We have to say that it is not that we are evolving into God, but it is God who humbled Himself to come into our spirit
The receiving here is not like having a very loving heart to receive brothers and sisters hospitably into your home
The Bible tells us But as many as received Him to them He gave the authority to become children of God to those who believe into His name
Children are born of the father; the father's life and nature and what the father has and is are all in the children
We have received into us this One who is the incarnated God and thus have the authority to become children of God
If they say that Christ is in them, then that is to admit that Christ is the Spirit because Christ can be in us only by being the Spirit
In the Scriptures there are more subjective doctrines than objective doctrines, and more subjective truths than objective truths
They say that on the one hand, we must honor Him, and on the other hand, we must humble ourselves to prostrate before Him as we worship
The Lord Jesus said, 'I am the bread of life which comes down out of heaven so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
Upon hearing us say that Christ lives in us, the opposers say, 'Don't you know how great Christ is and how small you are?
On the objective side, He is the Lord in heaven, who is above all and who is dignified and great with majesty and glory
Whenever we come together, some may praise the Lord, others may say, 'Amen,' and still others may call on the Lord
What this means is that we who were fallen have become children of God and members of Christ through regeneration and transformation
These are all subjective truths in the Scriptures, which include regeneration, transformation, and the mingling of God and man
Now we come to our Christian experience, which also has two aspects: the outward and the inward, the objective and the subjective
If there were no one teaching here, you would not know that there are subjective truths as well as objective doctrines in the Scriptures
You also did not know about the matter of transformation until you came to the meetings in the Lord's recovery
Among us, not only do we have doctrines, but we also have life; not only do we have knowledge, but we also have growth
The objective doctrines are for the subjective truths, and the subjective truths are for the producing of the church
Objective doctrines are composed of letters, whereas subjective truths are constituted with the Spirit and life, not with letters
Because we live by the Spirit and in life, we have the experience of the subjective truths and therefore have the church life
From this portion of the Word we see that what we have received into us becomes rivers of living water flowing out of us
Many of us can testify that we were living in a muddled and befuddled way; we had no beginning of our human life
The Lord became flesh not because the flesh is good; rather, He became flesh that He might become the Lamb to take away our sin
A person might have quarreled with someone last night, yet this morning without knowing why he says, 'Hallelujah!
The Spirit was not yet because the Lord Jesus had not yet been glorified, that is, He had not yet resurrected from the dead
Now we understand that the Gospel of John begins with the God who was in the beginning and ends with the Spirit
The God who was in the beginning went through incarnation, the death of the Lamb, and resurrection to become the Spirit
In this Spirit full redemption for sins was made, death was dealt with, and the flesh and the old creation were both nullified
Oh, our God passed through redemption and entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He is the all-inclusive Spirit!
On the one hand, electricity is in this meeting hall, but on the other hand, it is also in the power plant far away outside of town
On Sundays they go to their worship service in the morning and then play cards and watch movies in the afternoon
We want the electricity in the power plant, and we also want that electricity to be transmitted into our homes
He became the Lamb, died on the cross, and resurrected, and today in resurrection He is the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit
After you have the Word in your heart, if you go again to shuffle the mah-jongg tiles, He will 'shuffle' your heart
Since four refers to creatures and plants refer to humanity, this tells us that the four kinds of spices refer to the created man
Today, the condition of some people is such that God is 'one' and they are 'four,' but the two have not become 'five'
Originally we were number fours, but now, since there is the number one added into us, we have become number fives
The Lord's human living with His behavior is really a seasoning, and it causes our human life to be full of fragrance
There were many poisonous insects but if cassia was placed in the room all the poisonous insects and the snakes in particular would not come
In other words, before the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God had only divinity-the unique olive oil
After His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He compounded His humanity, which was a dying and sweet humanity, with divinity
Today this Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The two in the middle, cinnamon and calamus, measure two hundred and fifty shekels each, and together they form one unit
There are three units of five hundred; the first and last units are not split, but the middle unit is divided in half
Of the three units, the middle unit of five hundred shekels was split into two halves, each half being of two hundred and fifty shekels
He became the living water that we may drink Him, the bread of life that we may eat Him, and the breath of life that we may breathe Him
Nothing can be more subjective than the subjective experiences produced when water, bread, and breath get into us
All the subjective experiences that are linked to the Spirit and are hinged on life are for the producing of the church
Though the term church is not used, we should not overlook the fact that this book speaks of how the constituents of the church are produced
Originally the many grains were grains individually, but now they have been ground to powder and blended together to become one bread
We must see that the church is not a composition originated by human will; it is not an organization worked out by a group of people
The church is an issue of His dispensing into us through His death and resurrection to make us grains of wheat
When we as the grains of wheat are blended into one, we become the one bread, and this one bread signifies the one Body
One cannot become a constituent of the church merely by being baptized and 'joining the church' yet without receiving the Lord into him
Every one of us, the sons, has the life and nature of God the Father, and when we are put together, we are the church
When Christ was asleep on the cross, His side was opened, and there came out not only blood for redemption but also water for imparting life
Consider this: Before you were saved, perhaps your parents were already in the church, and they told you how lovely and sweet the church is
One day you were attracted by the Lord and moved by the Spirit, so you said to the Lord, 'O Lord, I'm a sinner
Once you repented and called on the name of the Lord in this way, you began to feel that the church was so good and so lovely
In the past you criticized your parents for always going to the meetings; now you also are constantly going to the meetings
They say, 'You don't want to buy this, and you try to save on that, but when it comes to the church, you don't care how much you spend
At the Lord's table, we are neither an organization nor a religious group; rather, we are those who have enjoyed Christ inwardly
His water of life has flowed into us from His pierced side, and with that rib in us we are being built into today's bride
We all have the same kind of material, the same one rib, with which God is building a universal woman, who is the bride, the church
There it says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
The main point we should not forget is that the church is produced as a result of our subjective experience of Christ
You may be a member of Christianity, even one who occupies a very high position there, but you still may not be a constituent of the church
On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the bride; on the other hand, it is the tabernacle of God with men, which is God's dwelling place
The entire Bible ends with a bride and a holy city as a dwelling place; both items were mentioned in the Gospel of John
In the last two chapters of Revelation you see that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the holy city, the dwelling place, and the tabernacle
As we are supplied by the living water and nourished by the tree of life, we become the bride, the tabernacle, and the dwelling place of God
In his Gospel, he spoke about how God flows out for us to drink that we may become the bride and the dwelling place of God
Through the revelation in the New Testament we can clearly see that God's intention is that we experience Him subjectively
Since He is the life-giving Spirit, we can receive Him and also enjoy Him, and the result is that the church is produced
These are three great points: there was no humanity in God; God had not passed through death; nor had God risen from the dead
If you say that He was God, you are absolutely right; if you say that He was man, you are also absolutely right
Not only so, after He lived for thirty-three and a half years in His humanity, one day He willingly walked into death
Only Jesus Christ, this One who was God yet man, died not because He was captured by death but because He walked into death willingly
He entered into death, passed through death, took a thorough look at death, overcame death, and conquered death
As a result, after His resurrection, even though He still had a human body and human nature, His body was no longer the same as before
It was not enough, however, for the Passover lamb just to be slain; it had to be cut into pieces and roasted by fire to be eaten
To be killed, cut into pieces, roasted by fire, and set on the table means that this lamb had to go through a process
To exemplify further, after we go to the market to buy groceries, we do not set them on the table and just eat them raw
In John 6, after the Lord Jesus said that He could be eaten, the Jewish religionists said, 'This word is hard; who can hear it'?
At that time He could not be eaten because He had neither been incarnated nor gone through death and resurrection
The holy anointing ointment was not merely oil; it was an ointment, and there were many ingredients in this ointment
In Him there are many elements: the elements of God, man, death, the effectiveness of death, resurrection, and the power of resurrection
The Lord accomplished His death to deal with sin, nullify death, destroy Satan, and get rid of every negative thing
In this Spirit there are the Triune God the uplifted humanity the allinclusive death with its effectiveness and resurrection with its power
Vincent said that the 'name' of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit denotes the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Vincent further said that the preposition here is into, indicating a divine union of the baptized one with the Triune God
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Your eyes cannot see Him and your hands cannot touch Him therefore if He were not denoted by a name it would be very difficult to have Him
To be baptized into the name of the Father the Son and the Spirit is to be baptized into the Triune Godthe Father the Son and the Spirit
When we immerse people into water we are baptizing them into the Triune God into Christ into the death of Christ and into the Body of Christ
We must use a lot of water as a symbol of the rich God, the glorious Christ, His all-inclusive death, and His universal Body
Each time the church has a baptism, if you do not have this confidence, this faith, then you should not baptize others
Corinthians 12:13 says, 'For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were all given to drink one Spirit'
After a few more minutes of calling, the inner light will become brighter, and we will end up dealing with our sins
Verses 9 and 10 show us that the Spirit of God dwells in us; that is the Spirit of Christ in us, and that is also Christ in us
Each time we were able to get two to three thousand to hear the gospel and three to four hundred to give us their names
You see that the result of twenty years of listening to messages is It is no longer Christ who lives in me but it is I a Hunanese who live
It is because this teaching is concerned with Christ coming into us to be our disposition, our life, and our person
You must put aside your disposition, life, and person and take Him completely to be your disposition, life, and person
The more you deal with the self the more difficult it becomes to be dealt with the more you deal with it the more it needs to be dealt with
When you encounter a certain matter, whether great or small, you must first put the matter aside and contact the Lord'
The truth remains the truth-in actuality we pay too much attention to people, matters, and things, dealing with them all day long
Brothers and sisters, we must see that these are all Satan's deceptions, Satan's distracting schemes, to draw our heart away from Christ
The New Testament clearly tells us, 'Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved'?
Today many in Christianity only see the biblical record of Christ's being taken up in ascension after His resurrection
You consider a suitable arrangement for the bed, the dining table, and the desk, and then place them accordingly
Today we need God to grant us grace by strengthening us into our inner man that we may let Christ make home in our hearts
Suppose there are two rooms that are still not opened; that means we have not yet made home in those two rooms
Tonight before the Lord you must solemnly consider this matter and ask O Lord in my practical living day by day are You living in me
The Lord's recovery is to recover our subjective experience of the Lord in order that the church can be realized practically
You need to live out a life that no one can describe yet they would admit that it is not anything humanly possible
If from today onward, these words can hit home in all of us, bringing us into this experience, then everything will be a success
We do not have any understanding of the many profound truths in the Scriptures concerning subjective experiences
In the original language of the Scriptures, this word does not have the notion of purity; instead, it is full of the meaning of separation
At this time we see that the leading of the Lord among us is for us to have a thorough view of these inward, subjective experiences
Of course, in the Bible, sanctification has both the objective, positional aspect and the subjective, dispositional aspect
All the other pieces of gold are in a common position; only this piece of gold, being placed in the temple, has been sanctified
Those who previously were quick and blunt in speaking and thus easily offended others now learn to be slow in their speaking
The sanctification referred to in the Scriptures is that we open ourselves to the Lord from our spirit and let the Lord come into us
It is not so important whether or not you joke, whether or not you offend others, and whether or not you criticize others
One day a sister who came from Shanghai acted very much like the statue of Mary you see in the Catholic cathedrals
To be made holy, to be sanctified, is to have God's element added into you whether you are laughing or you are not laughing
In order to have this element added into you, you must open to the Lord and call on Him from your spirit, 'O Lord'!
Whenever you have such a little opening and call, 'O Lord,' His element, His Spirit, will be added and increased in you
There are two kinds of genuine love that originate from God: one comes out as an overflow, and the other one comes out of transformation
The apostle Paul told them to break their concept concerning the law and turn their heart from the law to the Lord
They would have an unveiled face, and they would be like a mirror facing the Lord directly to behold and reflect Him
When it says that the mind needs to be transformed, we know that the emotion, the will, and the conscience also need to be transformed
After the element of the Lord has been added into us we will not be transformed instantly rather it will take time for us to be transformed
The Spirit of the Lord as the element added into us moves within us, gradually permeating and saturating our mind
After a period of time sanctification becomes transformation, and the result of transformation is conformation to the image of the Lord
We need to open up ourselves to the Lord and let the living Spirit of the Lord penetrate us, adding the divine element into us
Thank the Lord that when we have this experience, deep within us we can feel that we are different from others
At this time your thoughts, preferences, and decisions are all the same as the Lord's thoughts, preferences, and decisions
If we have truly seen this light, we will have to confess that these important points were all lost during the preceding centuries
After believing in the Lord, we love Him, pursue Him, live in the church life, and even participate in His service
We must admit that these ideas are still human concepts and religious thoughts which also have the flavor of ethics
Ultimately, we will be inwardly filled with Him, we will abide in Him, and we will become the one Body, which is the church
The love here is not just a matter of loving man but of loving God and of loving His economy, His move, and His eternal plan
The water in the center of the cup becomes the color of tea, but the water at the perimeter has yet to have the color of tea
If you say that this cup of water does not have tea in it, you are wrong; however, there is still a lot of water that is not tea
Thank the Lord that no matter what our situation was, when we came into the churches in the Lord's recovery, we heard this kind of word
Before you get married, you both think that you are like 'saints,' 'holy' persons, but after you get married, your 'holiness' is tested
You are forced to confess that you have not grown up into Christ in so many things, especially in the matter of speaking with your spouse
The sisters all speak like Mary when they are with the elders, but it is an altogether different story when they are with their husbands
The brothers are very proper when they speak in the church meetings, but their true color is revealed when they are alone with their wives
There is almost no growth into Christ in your speaking; rather, your speaking is ten thousand percent outside of Christ
We must hold to truth in love; we should hold to truth not only outside of morning watch but even in our dreams during our sleep
Growing up is a matter of constantly opening our being to allow the divine element to continuously increase within us
The divine element must be continually added into us, so that we can grow up into the Head, Christ, in the divine element
When the divine element is added into a certain part of our being, we grow up into the Head, Christ, in that part
Through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part' means that every part has its function
In the same way, you may not be a large shoulder or a knee, yet you are at least a little finger with your own function
It is through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part that the Body can be knit together
In the last message we spoke of sanctification, transformation, and conformation; in this message we will see growth and building
In other words, if we look at this from another angle, sanctification, transformation, and conformation are simply growth
Your growth depends on your transformation, and transformation depends on the divine element being added into you
If we are the joints of supply, our supply will be able to come out; if we are the parts, our function will be manifested
Verse 22 says, 'That you put off the old man,' and verse 23 says, 'And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind'
If you look at the context here, you will realize that the old man and the new man are not individual but corporate
Putting off the old man is putting off the social life, and putting on the new man is putting on the church life
In actuality it is just as if he draped a jacket around his shoulders, and the jacket falls off after a short time
His case is like putting an arm into one sleeve of the jacket; after a while when he moves around, the jacket still falls off
The next day suddenly one of the elders may be rude to him, so he becomes unhappy and unbuttons one of the buttons
The church life will be grown into your skin, your blood, and your marrow; you will remain a man for the church even after you die
Between the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man, it says, 'And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind'
He continually adds His divine element into us thoroughly saturating our entire being and thus we are transformed and conformed to His image
Dear brothers and sisters, today our fighting is for this, our prayer is for this, and our testimony is for this
The Lord today must have this testimony in each locality on the earth before He can return and His kingdom be brought in
In these past few days we have seen more and more clearly that the church is the result of our subjective experience of the Lord
Today the Lord wants to recover what He planned in the beginning and what was realized at the time of Pentecost
According to the revelation of the New Testament, the church is the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh
Apparently we are ordinary people who are outwardly no different from any other people, but there is a mystery within us
These people are here in a kind of condition that is hard to describe and very mysterious, so it is difficult for people to understand
If you get very excited when you watch basketball or baseball games, then others immediately know that you are a sports fan
They are neither too excited nor too formal; they neither laugh loudly nor laugh softly, but simply smile warmly
Some say, 'In the so-called local churches there is a great heresy because they worship themselves as gods in their meetings
They claim that whenever they meet, God is manifested among them, that they are gods, and that they are one with God
All the Bible scholars confess that the most difficult matter in expounding the Bible is finding the meaning of the original language
According to the original language verse 15 says The house of God which is the church of the living God the pillar and base of the truth
The church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh
If the text is read according to the original Greek, no one can deny that God manifested in the flesh here refers to the church
The Lord Jesus was first taken up in glory, then the day of Pentecost came, and then He was preached among the nations
They remain stuck in their narrow concepts and are not willing to confess that the Body is also the manifestation of God in the flesh
The Lord meant, 'When you persecuted Stephen, you were persecuting Me; when you persecute My disciples, you are persecuting Me'
To put it a little more poetically, the church is the great mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh
If we live by God and take God as our living and our person, then when we come together, it will be the manifestation of God in the flesh
Some brothers and sisters are married; the meeting is at 7:30, but at 6:30 they may begin arguing, and they argue until 7:00
When they come together, they do not need even to speak; all they need to do is sit there, and the angels will say, 'Behold!
We must know the church to such an extent that we know the church as the great 'mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh'
The church is the Body, and the Head is Christ, so the manifestation of God in the flesh here is applied to both
The Head has already been taken up in glory, but the Body is still on the way of being taken up and has not yet entered into glory
Whenever we meet, on the one hand, we are the manifestation of God in the flesh, and on the other hand, we are heading for glory
The church is the great mystery of godliness as the manifestation of God in the flesh and is being taken up in glory
Every time we come together it is the manifestation of God in the flesh and we are heading toward the goal of glory and proceeding toward it
When you read Romans 8 you can see that those whom God called first He predestinated justified and conformed them and then He glorified them
Thessalonians 1:10 says, 'When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed in that day'
When we will be raptured at His coming back, not only will we enter into glory, but the Lord Jesus will also be glorified in us
Today the Lord Jesus is still concealed within us and has not yet been manifested, so He cannot come out in glory
When He comes and raptures us to Himself, He will saturate our entire being to completely glorify Himself from within us
