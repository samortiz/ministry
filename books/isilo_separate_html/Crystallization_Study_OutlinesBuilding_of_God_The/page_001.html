<h1 class="title">The Vision of the Building of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16; Rev. 21:2-3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The entire Bible is a book of building; the main subject of the Bible is the building of God&mdash;Gen. 28:10-22; Matt. 16:18; Rev. 21:2-3.</li>
<li>The central and divine thought of the Scriptures is that God is seeking a divine building as the mingling of Himself with humanity&mdash;a living composition of persons redeemed by and mingled with Himself&mdash;Exo. 25:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to have a group of people built up as a spiritual building to express God and to represent God by dealing with His enemy and recovering the lost earth&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
	<li>Whatever God is doing today&mdash;in preaching the gospel, edifying the saints, or establishing churches&mdash;is part of His building work; these activities are part of God&rsquo;s main work, the work of building&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>We need to be enlightened by and fully saturated with the thought that in this universe God is doing only one thing&mdash;building His eternal habitation&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; Rev. 21:2-3.</li>
	<li>For the sake of His coming back, the Lord needs the church to be built up; only the church built up according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire can be the stepping stone into the age of the kingdom&mdash;Matt. 16:18, 27-28.</li>
	<li>To be built up with fellow believers is the Lord&rsquo;s supreme and highest requirement of His faithful seekers according to the divine oneness of the Divine Trinity&mdash;John 17.</li>
	<li>Being built up with fellow partakers of the divine life is the highest virtue of one who pursues after Christ according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Phil. 3:7-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The building of God is the Triune God as life wrought into us continually so that under His transfusion and infusion we become His corporate expression&mdash;Eph. 3:17a, 19b, 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the mingling of God with man, that is, God mingling Himself with us; thus, the church is God&rsquo;s building composed of Himself as the divine material mingled with man as the human material&mdash;John 14:20; 15:4a; 1 John 4:15; Eph. 3:17; 1 Cor. 3:9, 11.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16; John 17:22; Eph. 3:19b, 21.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the enlargement, the expansion, of God to express God in a corporate way&mdash;John 3:29a, 30a; Col. 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Because the building is what God desires, the entire Old Testament is on the subject of God&rsquo;s building:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The account of Jacob&rsquo;s dream at Bethel is the most crucial word in the revelation of God, including the whole Bible in its scope and requiring the rest of the Bible to explain it&mdash;Gen. 28:10-22; Matt. 16:18; 1 Tim. 3:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Genesis 28:10-22 is the first place in the Scriptures where God reveals that His intention is to build Himself together with man and to have a dwelling place, a Bethel, on earth.</li>
		<li>In Genesis 35 the vision of Bethel came again, not as a dream but as a reality; in Genesis 35 there is a crucial and radical turn from the individual experience of God to the corporate experience of God&mdash;the experience of God as the God of Bethel (v. 7)&mdash;Eph. 3:17-21; 4:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>According to the book of Exodus, God&rsquo;s building is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;25:8-9; 40:1-38:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The purpose of Exodus is to show that the goal of God&rsquo;s full salvation is the building up of His dwelling place&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2, 4-5; Eph. 2:1-22.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s chosen people are to be built up together into one entity, the tabernacle, where God and man may mutually meet, communicate, and dwell.</li>
		<li>In Christ we and God, and God and we, are built together, meet together, and dwell together; this is the central thought of the book of Exodus.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s dwelling place must be built according to the pattern revealed on the mountain&mdash;Exo. 25:8-9; Heb. 8:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The tabernacle and the temple typify two aspects of the church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The tabernacle was designed for the wilderness and was transitory in nature; the temple was designed for the kingdom and was eternal in nature&mdash;Exo. 40:2; 1 Kings 6:2.</li>
		<li>The tabernacle typifies God&rsquo;s church on earth, whereas the temple typifies the church as Christ&rsquo;s unique Body; the church appears in different localities, yet the spiritual reality of the church is still one Body, which is unique and eternal&mdash;Rev. 1:11; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>
		<li>The temple is a type of Christ and also of the Body of Christ:</li>
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The temple first typifies Christ and then the church, as the unique building of God in the universe&mdash;Matt. 12:6; 1 Cor. 3:16; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
			<li>These two&mdash;Christ and His Body, the church&mdash;are the center, the reality, and the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;5:32.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The temple replaced the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling on earth; thus, the tabernacle was mingled with the temple&mdash;1 Kings 6:2; 8:1-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God charged Ezekiel to show the people of Israel the pattern of His house, because He intended to examine their living and conduct according to His house as a rule and pattern&mdash;Ezek. 43:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The building of God is a pattern, and we need to examine ourselves in light of this pattern&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
		<li>Our behavior and conduct should be examined not only according to moral regulations and spiritual principles but also according to the house of God&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s requirement is according to His house, and we must all be measured and checked according to the building of God&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
		<li>The Body life is the greatest test of our spirituality; if we cannot pass the test of the Body life, our spirituality is not genuine&mdash;1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 4:16; Col. 2:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
