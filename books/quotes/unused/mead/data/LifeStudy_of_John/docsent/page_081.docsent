   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Sheep Signifying God s Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sheep are God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In eternity past, God with His foresight had chosen His people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In time, before Christ came, God put His chosen people into the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Christ came, He wanted all of His people to come out of the law s custody.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The blind man who was cast out of the Jewish synagogue and who came to the Lord Jesus is one of God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was under the custody of the law, but he was taken out of it unto the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Door Signifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>for Going in and Going out</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does it mean to say that Christ is the door?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most Christians think that the door is for people to enter into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps some of you reading this message still hold on to this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the door here is not for you to go to heaven, for this door enables people to go in and out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this door were the door into heaven, how could people go out of it?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This door is not the door into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is the door to the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Originally, the fold was the law, and the Lord was the door into the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord was not only the door into the law; He is also the door for people to come out of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 9 says, I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the door, not only for God s elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc., in the Old Testament time before Christ came; but also for God s chosen people, such as Peter, James, John, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law after Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So the Lord indicates in verse 9 that He is the door not only for God s chosen people to go in, but also for God s chosen people to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who went into the law were people like Moses, the psalmists, and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ was the door for these people to go into the fold of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, they went into the fold through Christ and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we adopt this point of view when reading the writings of Moses, the psalmists, and the prophets, we will realize that they entered into the law of God through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ was their entrance into the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the time the Lord Jesus came, so many people were still in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, after the coming of Jesus, God no longer intended to keep His chosen people in the fold of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God wanted them to come out of the law into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, by that time, Christ no longer was the door for God s chosen people to enter into the fold; He was the door for those who were already in the fold to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The blind man was one who was coming out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Formerly, all of the servants sent by God went into the law through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But although Christ had come, the fold was still full of sheep who were confined within it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They had to come out of the fold through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the Old Testament age, God sent many of His servants into the fold of the law through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now during the New Testament age, God intends to bring His people out of the law through Christ as the door.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now I believe you understand that the sheepfold was the Old Testament law, which was utilized by the Jews to form the religion of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Judaism became the fold to confine all of the Lord s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But Christ has come and the pasture is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, there is no need for the sheep to be confined any longer in the custody of the Judaistic law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must be released from the fold of the law that they might enjoy all of the riches of the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To summarize, Christ as the door is both the entrance and the exit of the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Firstly, the Old Testament saints went into the fold, which was the law, through Christ as the door.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now the New Testament believers are to come out of the law through Christ as the same door.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Next, the fold of the law was used by God as a slave to keep and take care of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was used then to bring them to Christ Himself who was the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After they had been sent to the schoolmaster, there is no further need to remain under the hands of the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fold of the law, which became Judaism, confined all of His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Christ is the door through whom the New Testament believers may come out of Judaism and come into Him as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, the Lord is also the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is not only the door of the fold, but also the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He comes to call His people out of the fold, and His sheep can recognize His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the first one out of the fold, which is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now He walks before His sheep, who all will eventually follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Peter, James, and John came out of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even Paul came out of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of the Jews who believed in the Lord Jesus followed Him out of the Judaistic fold.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The blind man was one who came out of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was cast out of the synagogue of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was cast out of that fold because of the living Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the Lord took the opportunity to speak forth this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord let the Jews know that their religion was just a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He made it known that the pasture is now ready and that it was unnecessary for the sheep to remain in their fold.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now is the time for the sheep to come out of the fold and to enjoy the riches of the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The one the Jewish people cast out of their synagogue became one who enjoyed the Lord as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord is first the door, then the shepherd, and finally the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The shepherd takes all of the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and brings them to Himself as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is the shepherd who brought the sheep out of the fold; He is the door through whom the sheep are brought out; and He is the pasture to whom the sheep are brought.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He simply brought the sheep out of Judaism through Himself, unto Himself, and for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is everything the exit, the shepherd, and the pasture.</S>
