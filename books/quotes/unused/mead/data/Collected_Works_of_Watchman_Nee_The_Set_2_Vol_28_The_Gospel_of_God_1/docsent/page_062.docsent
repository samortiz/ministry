   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF SALVATION NOT BEING PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We come now to the fifth "not being."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many people who will add another condition to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not law-keeping or good behavior, nor is it repentance or confession.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They say that a person must pray in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They base their claim on Romans 10: "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 13 . As a result, some believe that they must beseech God before they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On a number of occasions I have encountered some people who wanted to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They said, "Daily I plead with God to save me, and I still do not know when He will do so.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been praying for three months without any inward sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I just do not know if God will see fit to save me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have also met some others who said, "I am waiting for the Holy Spirit to come and move me to my knees to ask Jesus to save me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not saved as yet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I must wait for the Spirit to inspire me to pray before I can be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, we need to see whether a man needs to pray before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, one seeks to be saved through praying and begging because he is entirely ignorant of God's love and God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He thinks that God hates man, and therefore he must pray for God to change His mind before He will save him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He gives himself to pray, without knowing how much he has to pray before God will hear him or listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Remember how Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He challenged them to ask their god to send down fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The prophets "cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them" 1 Kings 18:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They supposed that Baal would listen if they would only inflict more pain upon their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today there are those who also think that if they bring distress upon themselves and plead enough with God, He will have compassion on them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These kinds of people have never seen the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because they have never seen God in the light of the gospel, they believe that their begging before God will turn His heart towards them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually there is no need for God to turn His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His heart has long been turned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are the ones who need a turn of heart, because we rejected and opposed Him, and we did not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Corinthians 5:19 says, "God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God did not wrong man; it is man who has wronged God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There has never been a need for God to be reconciled to man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, man has to be reconciled to God because it is man who is totally at fault.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The problem is not with God, but with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone who desires to understand the gospel ought to know that God is love and that He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has no problem with us, and neither do we need to plead with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, man thinks that he must pray and plead before he can be saved because he simply does not realize that the Lord Jesus has come; He has died and resurrected, all of sin's problems are solved, and all obstacles to salvation are removed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only has the Lord Jesus come, but the Holy Spirit has also come.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He came to make manifest in man what God and the Lord Jesus have accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many sinners pray for their salvation as if they were asking the Lord Jesus to die for them again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They do not realize that He has completely finished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since He has finished His work, there is absolutely no reason for us to plead with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today is the time for thanksgivings and praises; it is not the time for filing requests and petitions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose your parents have brought you something that you asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may perhaps, out of sincerity, bow to thank them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Certainly you would not kneel down and beg to have that item, saying, "Please give this to me because I need it."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is simply pointless and senseless for you to continue to beg after your parents have already given the item to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today God is not speaking about the severity of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He were, then there may be a reason for you to plead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, God is now saying that He has freely given you His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It would be a strange thing indeed if someone gave you something and you were still begging instead of thanking!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you know God's heart, and if you are clear about the Lord Jesus' work, you would never attempt to be saved through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Prayer has no place in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is better for you to kneel to thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once after I had shared the gospel with a man, I asked if he would believe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He replied that he would.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I said, "Let us kneel down," he asked if we were going to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I told him, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He asked, "For what purpose then?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I answered, "Simply to inform the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no need to ask Jesus to die again or to ask God to love, to be gracious, or to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord has already borne our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now our only need is to notify Him by saying, "I have believed the Son of God, and I have received the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>O God, I thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is this not easy?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yes, to receive salvation is an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It was, of course, not an easy thing for God to accomplish salvation; it took God four thousand years to accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After man fell, it took God four thousand years to cause man to realize his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He then caused His Son to be born of a woman and to hang on the cross to be judged for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the end He also sent the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is only after God has done so much work and expended so much effort that we can receive salvation in such an easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He has paid the greatest price to accomplish everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now if you have believed and received, all you need to do is to say, "Thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no place for prayer here.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why then does Romans 10 bring up the matter of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Romans 10:5 through 7 reads, "For Moses writes concerning the righteousness which is out of the law: The man who does them shall live by them.'</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Two kinds of righteousness are mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One is the righteousness which is out of the law, and the other, righteousness which is out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The righteousness out of the law results from one's works before God, and the righteousness out of faith is accomplished in us through our believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The former has everything to do with us, and the latter, everything to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is absolutely impossible for a man to obtain the righteousness out of the law, because it requires him to be sinless in his thoughts, intentions, words, and behavior for every year, hour, minute, and second of his life from the time he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If he breaks any one item of the law, he transgresses the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For us, this is simply a hopeless proposition.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since we cannot have the righteousness out of the law, we need to have the righteousness out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This righteousness, as we have mentioned, is the righteousness through which Christ was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Since Christ has suffered the punishment, we have this righteousness through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This righteousness has absolutely nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Scriptures say, " Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is no need for us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no need to ascend into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This means that there is no need to ask Christ to come to the earth to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is also no need to descend into the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This implies that the resurrection of Christ is now the basis of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God has already caused the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect, and His resurrection has become the basis of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All that remains for us to do is to believe.</S>
