   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. THE BREATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 20:22 says, "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the Spirit of life is likened to breath, which is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 20:22 the Spirit as the breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord Jesus imparted Himself into them as life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit is actually nothing less than the resurrected Lord Jesus Himself, because this Spirit is His breath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word for Spirit in this verse is pneuma, a word that is used for breath, spirit, and wind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, this verse can rightly be translated, "Receive the holy breath."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day of His resurrection Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Gospel of John we have God, life, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapters one through seventeen show us God living among men; chapters eighteen and nineteen, life passing through death; and chapters twenty and twenty-one, the Spirit, the pneuma, moving in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This moving of the Spirit in resurrection has not ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning this, there is no end to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Gospel does not give us a record of Christ's public ascension as we have in Mark and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Gospel of John, the resurrected Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath, as the Spirit, and now dwells in them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, this breath, this pneuma, this Spirit, is still moving in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The divine breath in John 20:22 is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Testament reveals that the Triune God became incarnated, lived as a man on earth, ministered, entered into death, conquering and subduing it, and came forth from death in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh," and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the incarnated One was the Triune God to be a man as the last Adam, and this last Adam in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, on the day of His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples, breathed upon them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to see the vision of the Triune God becoming the last Adam and the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the Spirit symbolized by the breath breathed into the disciples on the day of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>D. THE WIND PNEUMA</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 3:8 the wind is a symbol of the Spirit: "The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word for wind, pneuma, is the same word for Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether it means the wind or the Spirit depends upon the context.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The context here says that it blows, and the sound of it can be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that it is the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The wind brings air for us to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit as the wind brings air for our spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>E. A RUSHING VIOLENT WIND</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Acts 2:2 we have the symbol of a rushing violent wind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This verse says, "Suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Lord's resurrection the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples for their spiritual being and living essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Lord's ascension the Spirit of ascension power, poured out upon the disciples, is symbolized by the rushing violent wind for the disciples' ministry and move economically.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to see clearly the difference between the breathing in John 20 and the blowing in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The breathing in John 20 is for the imparting of the life-giving Spirit into the disciples essentially for their spiritual being and living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the blowing in Acts 2 is for the pouring out of the economical Spirit of power upon the believers, who have already received the essential Spirit into them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The pouring out of the Spirit of power is not for the believers' spiritual being or living; rather, the outpouring of the Spirit of power is for the believers' ministry and move.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the essential aspect of the Spirit, symbolized by the breath, is for living, and the economical aspect of the Spirit, symbolized by the rushing violent wind, is for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We praise the Lord for the breathing of the Spirit in John 20 and for the blowing of the Spirit in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The breathing is for life, and the blowing is for move.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, the breathing gives us inner strength, and the blowing gives us outer authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through the breathing and the blowing we are fully equipped.</S>
