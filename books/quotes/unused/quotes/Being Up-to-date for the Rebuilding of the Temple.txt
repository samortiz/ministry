The older ones should not be discouraged, because there is a verse in the Bible that says, 'So that your youth is renewed like the eagle'
Hymn 715 in the Chinese hymnal says, 'The withering days of life are seemingly increasing but actually decreasing'
Some Christians who are already over eighty have subtracted more than eighty years from their life and do not have many years left
In particular, we see many elderly saints in the meetings who welcome people with smiles and are full of vigor
Even though the writer of Psalm 52 may have been aged, he saw himself as a flourishing olive tree that was growing in the house of Jehovah
We all should be like Simeon who received a revelation from the Holy Spirit that was not related to peace or prosperity but to Christ
Later, the Holy Spirit moved him to enter the temple because the consolation of Israel, for whom he had been waiting, had arrived
The Old Testament promised again and again that Christ would come, and it hinted that Christ was the consolation of God's people
Even though the elderly Simeon was merely in the Old Testament and had not entered the New Testament, he received such a high revelation
Of course, all parents think about their children, but we have to realize that it is not worthwhile to think about our children so much
Most young people think about what to wear and how to adorn themselves whereas most elderly people do not think about these things
A person spends all his money for himself when he is young, but when he is old, he saves every penny for his children
If we dream of Christ at night think about Christ in the morning talk about Christ all the time and are full of Christ we will be blessed
In the past we elderly people were filled with either our daughters and sons or with our sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren
If we all lived in this kind of condition, we would spontaneously open our mouths to praise the Lord when we come to the meeting
If like Simeon we think about Christ speak Christ and even dream about Christ at night our change of the system will surely be successful
Our changing the system in these few years is not to change the way of our meetings or merely to change a method
The Gospel of Luke tells us that this elderly sister was 'serving God with fastings and petitions night and day'
Verse 38 says, 'She came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem'
If people ask us how our sons or sons-in-law are doing, we would say, 'I thank the Lord that everything is fine
We would also become those who love to meet, because we would realize that it is not very enjoyable to speak merely to our family at home
We would realize our need to be with all the saints and to speak Christ for the building up the Body of Christ
If we consider those who are mothers, we will realize that what they worry about is that their children will not know how to speak
In the meetings over these past thirty years, there were some who called hymns, some who prayed, and some who spoke
Although we were studying in an American school, none of us dared to wear a suit, because if we wore suits, we would be scolded
At that time if someone were to walk on the street in a suit, people on the street would scold him for conforming to Western fashion
Although we have been delivered from Christianity, the traditions of Christianity have not been purged from us
When people come to the meetings, they just sit quietly and wait for the preacher to speak a good message for them
They said that the second reason was that more and more younger saints were going to the United States to study
Our traditional way of meeting was to shut people's mouths so that the longer people met with us, the more they did not open their mouths
During our history of more than thirty years in Taiwan never before have we had twentyfour thousand people baptized in less than four months
We estimated that one out of every four baptized would remain, but the results have been beyond our estimation
Some of the ones baptized have been unable to come into our midst for a time because of certain situations such as moving
We have to realize that our gatherings in the homes are more important than the big meetings at the meeting halls
The elders of all the halls must lead and oversee the saints so that they would have at least one small group meeting a week
We have a kind of slogan that says, 'Heaven may fade, and earth may flee, but small group meetings must never be missed'
In the big meetings there are people who release messages to us, and once a message is given, the taste is strong
There are some saints among us who never speak, but if they were to open their mouths, the meeting would be enriched
When you come to the meeting, you may try to stand up to speak a few phrases such as, 'O Lord, thank You that You are so good'!
If ten people were meeting together, and everyone spoke briefly like this, the meeting would surely be fresh and living
Even if we were newly saved, we still would have the essential characteristic in us of being able to speak for the Lord
When we give a testimony, we are often afraid that people may not understand what we are saying, so we try to say more
Finally, he felt that he had waited too long and said to everyone, 'Saints, while our dear sister is still praying, let us sing'
In the meetings we have to avoid being silent while at the same time avoid speaking too long, telling stories, or giving our history
We may tell him that the brothers and sisters care for him and that we hope he can come to our small group meeting in two days
John 2:12-19 addresses the fathers, the young men, and the young children, classifying the saints in the church into these three categories
Verse 14b says I have written to you young men because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one
In the world are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boast, vainglory, and pride of the present life
According to the statistics we gathered four years ago, there were around 610 local churches all over the globe
When we entered the meeting, they were already singing and were full of vigor, just like the young people in the young people's meetings
We do not mean that we should ask them for gold to build a big meeting hall but that we should cause each one of them to be living
We have around three thousand teachers working in kindergartens, elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools, and colleges
If these three thousand teachers were all motivated, what kind of an effect would they produce in the schools?
The fifteen thousand high school and junior high school students who came to the last gospel meeting were brought mostly by their teachers
On the other hand, we also have close to one hundred fifty medical personnel, including doctors, nurses, and technicians
The saints spoke The Mystery of Human Life to the taxi drivers while commuting from Hall One to Hall Three, and some were saved and baptized
Many of them had stopped meeting for a long time, but through our door-knocking and contact they were brought back
The Bible does not mention the name 'Satan'; instead, it mentions his nature and what he does, saying that he is the evil one
In Greek the phrase evil one is a particular, emphatic phrase denoting that he is absolutely evil and is contagious and influential
Rather, it attacks people inwardly, causing them to become insane, to turn bad, and to be unable to live at peace
Some translations render the phrase the evil one as the evil, but actually, the evil here refers to the evil one
The phrase love of the Father implies that the Father's love is within us, causing us to love the Father, that is, to love God
Evil infects people, causing them to not have peace and to do bad things that affect others and causes them to not have peace
To be strong means that even though there are many things and matters that oppose God, we are still able to stand
Fifty years ago in Shanghai, the biggest metropolis in China, a wealthy person would pay five hundred dollars for a piece of clothing
A few days later, another wealthy person would wear an almost identical piece of clothing, but would pay double the price for it
Whether we are speaking of Shanghai in the past or Taipei in the present, many department stores have made money from the pride of life
In Revelation 18 Babylon the Great sells all kinds of items, such as ivory and precious stone, but the last item is the souls of men
If we work eight hours a day, five and a half days a week, we should be able to earn more than enough for our living
Rather, He only wants us to take one way, which is to believe in Jesus that we would be saved and receive the eternal life
Strictly speaking, the will of God is that we who are saved, who love Him, and who follow Him, would live a normal church life
When we are properly living in the Body of Christ, we are following the Lord, obeying the will of God, and doing the will of God
Today we must clearly see that the best way to preach the gospel and deliver the gospel is to visit people by door-knocking
Jehovah promised this to His people, saying, 'Showing lovingkindness to thousands of generations of those who love Me'
The whole world can testify that they never expected Taiwan to develop to such a degree, especially in its economic achievements
We all have to see that taking this new way will bring us back to the proper church life that we may do God's will
We should not follow the custom of the Gentiles, being anxious about what to eat and drink and what to wear every day
In a similar way, when we buy something at a store, the store may give us a small gift that does not cost anything
If we seek God's kingdom but are detached from the church and do not live the church life, then we are not truly seeking God's kingdom
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
We who love the Lord, in the midst of our busy lives, must present our bodies to the Lord and place ourselves in the church life
We may be from the east, the west, the north, or the south, and we may have our own distinctions, customs, and regulations
Very often we present our bodies and have some renewing and transformation in our mind, but our spirit is very cold, not burning
A normal Christian should possess three things: a presented body, a renewed and transformed mind, and a burning spirit
If we did not love the Lord and came to the meetings only once a year, there would be no problems in the church
When we are raised up to love the Lord, to present our bodies, and to meet daily, we have more and more opinions
One day we may say that the chair arrangement is not right, and the next day we may say that the curtains were not hung properly
We need the Lord to be merciful to us, to grant us sufficient grace, to renew and transform us, and to make us burning in spirit
Rather, they only need to say, 'O Lord, You know what my son needs and what kind of circumstances he encounters
In every single Epistle that Paul wrote he asked the receivers to pray regarding the word of God and spiritual matters
The elderly saints need first to set aside a fixed time, rain or shine, to pray for the church and to have much fellowship
The gospel work in the high schools is very active, and many of the teachers have been raised up to be burdened for the gospel
If all these doctors and nurses were burning in spirit, the gospelization of Taiwan would be accomplished very soon
If we receive this burden to spend at least ten to fifteen minutes each day to pray, the church in Taipei will be changed in half a year
The more tracks we lay, and the farther and broader we lay them, the more God's will can move on the earth without obstruction
The one thing we must pay particular attention to when we go to a small group meeting is that we all have to speak
We may find an appropriate word from the verses that we pray-read each day, and we may speak for two minutes at the most
If there are ten or twenty people meeting and each speaks for two minutes, then each one will have three chances to speak
The spirit of the new way is to allow each saint to have the opportunity to function and to open his or her mouth to speak for the Lord
We all have to be encouraged to change our old habit of not speaking and prepare before the meeting to speak in the meeting
In our preparation we may find the main points or the paragraphs with which we were touched and for which we have a feeling
There were two microphones in the meeting place-the brothers lined up behind one, and the sisters lined up behind the other
There was a large baptistery on the platform, and whoever had brought a new one was responsible to baptize him
The elderly saints should take the lead to have a set time of prayer every day and should attend the small group meetings every week
After the children get off from school, the elderly saints may open their homes and prepare some snacks to welcome them
If the saints had taken this word and practiced it, we would have twenty to thirty thousand young people today
Gaining people in this way is very safe, because they are taught by us and receive the gospel from us from their youth
If this were the case, many young saints would not need to put aside their gospel work at school to do the children's work
For which of you, wanting to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?
When people hear this passage, they often find it difficult to take, because what is spoken of in this portion is very high and absolute
It is normal for a pursuing Christian to believe and obey the Lord's word before Him and to live and act according to His word
The Lord used the examples of building a tower and engaging in war to ask those who were following Him to calculate the cost
The requirements of the Lord Jesus that are shown in the Gospels are fulfilled by the things which relate to life and godliness
We may be unable to respond to and to fulfill the requirement in Luke 14, but after we were saved, a life came into us
One day the Lord Jesus saw him and told him to let down his nets, and immediately he caught a great number of fish
He gave a testimony in his Epistle, testifying that God's divine power has granted to us all things that relate to life and godliness
God has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises in order that we may escape the corruption which is in the world by lust
Even though the island of Taiwan is flourishing, is economically prosperous, and has a peaceful and stable living, corruption is everywhere
Whether a man is in a high position or in a low position, whether he eats well or not, he is always busy working for his livelihood
According to the record in the Bible while he was on the way a light from heaven beyond the brightness of the sun suddenly shone around him
Human life needs to be supported by food, clothing, housing, and transportation that it may be sustained to fulfill God's purpose
Rather, we only need to fulfill our duty to work and to make a living, although we should not pursue after the world and follow its trend
Gradually, after they graduated from school, began to work, got married, and had children, they could not keep up with the church life
In America we often observe that some couples who are foreign students usually live a simple life at the beginning
The lust that 2 Peter 1:4 speaks about is the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the vainglory of life
We should not pursue material things because in that pursuit there may be an insatiable covetousness and the lust to covet
Rather, the doctors should go to the villages so that they may heal their patients and preach the gospel to them at the same time
They may contact twenty to thirty patients each day, and among all these patients there should be a son of peace
If they saved one person each day, they would save thirty in a month and three hundred and sixty-five in a year
We should spend at least one or two evenings each week to go door-knocking to speak the gospel or to have home meetings with the saved ones
Though they did not pursue the world for their children, the majority of them and their children were even blessed by the Lord
Today in Taiwan competition in all the professions is keen, and everyone wants to make more money to raise their standard of living
As the salt of the earth we remove the corruption from the trend of the world, and as the light of the world we shine in an age of darkness
Some try to act meek and submissive and try to flatter their superiors in order to get promoted, but we live by the Lord
There is bribery in every nation all over the world, but we Christians do not participate in such illegal behavior
We are not only different from the unbelievers, but we are also different from the believers in the denominations and in the Catholic Church
We have received many truths, we know and experience the divine life, and every one of us has a sweet history with the Lord
We have learned the secret and are able to do all things in the One who empowers us at every time and in every place
Today in this age of technology with such convenient means of transportation, we have no excuse for not accomplishing anything
In our meetings we must share how we lived in Christ, read the Bible, prayed, and fellowshipped with the Lord that week
Another thing is that we have to knock on doors or visit people to establish home meetings once or twice every week
We should make a vow before the Lord to do these two things: establish small group and home meetings and go door-knocking
The first matter is the restoration of the Jewish nation, and the second matter is the return of Jerusalem into the hands of the Jews
For more than two thousand five hundred years, it was fully possessed by the Gentiles without ever falling back into the hands of the Jews
During the Six-day War in 1967 the Israelis defeated tens of thousands of Arabs, a numerically superior enemy, and regained Jerusalem
The focus will be especially on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea where petroleum is being produced today
If this situation continues to develop, no politician in the world will be able to tell how the situation will turn out
What is certain is that a climax to the situation in the Middle East is imminent, and once the situation explodes, it will be hard to handle
In 1918 at the end of World War I, various nations signed a peace treaty, but peace was maintained on the earth for only thirteen years
From that day until today, a period of more than forty years, there have been no international wars because no one has dared to initiate war
With the invention of atomic weapons in this new age, the consequences of an international war breaking out are unimaginable
The United Nations was established after this war, but during the past forty or more years, it has not borne much responsibility
Due to the two world wars, people have learned not to wage wars, but when the time comes, they will still have to fight
Two hundred years ago nations were able to tend to their own business, but today the whole world is connected together
Revelation 16 speaks of three unclean spirits as frogs going forth into the whole inhabited earth to stir up wars
Behind Soviet Russia is a spirit that never does anything good but instead does evil things, stirring up the world into chaos
After the millennium Satan will instigate mankind's last rebellion against God, and Gog and Magog will take the lead
If Soviet Russia had not played a role behind the scenes, there would not have been such a situation in the Persian Gulf today
In the last century it can be said that England took the leading role in Christianity and was the most prominent place for Christianity
In less than one hundred years, Great Britain, especially Northern Scotland, has almost become like a Gentile world of unbelievers
Although Christianity is the state religion of England, the number of Christians there is decreasing drastically
Around one hundred and fifty years ago, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland came to Taiwan and established the Presbyterian Church
Now over a hundred years have passed, yet the number of people in the entire Presbyterian Church is only 150,000
In South Korea there are ten million Christians among a total population of fifty million, representing twenty percent of the population
Even in mainland China, where the Communist party persecutes Christians severely, there has been an increase in the number of Christians
The Lord Himself raised up the young people in China to preach the gospel, and the Communist party could not stop them
During the first twenty years that the Communist party was in power, the number of Christians did not increase
Like a flood, in less than twenty years the number of Christians rose from three or five million to fifty million
We preach the gospel and baptize people year after year, but according to the statistics, there is no increase
Otherwise, we will be like the secular people whose eyes are darkened and who know only to walk but do not know where they are going
We have the prophecy of the Scriptures as a lamp to our feet and a light to our path, and we can testify that we are not groping in the dark
We allowed the saints to offer voluntarily according to the Lord's leading through announcements, fellowship, and encouragement
Our 'family' was good in every way except for the fact that we did not bear children and had no multiplication
Transportation is convenient, and the population is dense, making it very convenient for the preaching of the gospel
If the churches in Taiwan do not change their system and make a turn, in the long run several hundred churches overseas will be affected
According to what we have seen and felt, we should abandon the big meetings so that everyone would then meet in the homes
They may be accustomed to using 'chopsticks,' but now they must not only continue to use chopsticks but also begin to use 'forks'
For the sake of the offspring and the future of the entire family, it is worthwhile even if the elderly saints suffer some loss
The first thing we should do in our living is to get up early in the morning to call, 'O Lord Jesus' and to enjoy two verses
The furnishings of our home should be elegant and proper and our clothing should also be noble and graceful neither luxurious nor too plain
Once a person believes in the Lord and receives the Lord, we should baptize him and go to his home to have home meetings with him
In the new way we all should practice preaching the gospel by door-knocking, leading the home meetings, and speaking in the meetings
If you are a housewife, you may establish a housewives' propagation group with the ones in your family as its members
No matter what career, profession, or status you have, you may establish your own propagation group with the brothers and sisters around you
After observing the present situation three years later, we have found that almost none of the saints go to the small group meetings
Now we need to begin the groups again in a way so that our small groups would not be something arranged or divided according to districts
We all know that the hardest thing regarding the changing of the system is the establishment of the small group meetings
When the small group meetings were first established three years ago, the condition of the groups was very good
We stressed again and again that no one should be the head in the small group meeting but that everyone should speak
If someone thinks that the small group meeting that he attends is good and he is willing to continue there, then we should not stop him
If someone thinks that the small group meeting that he attends is not good and he does not want to go, we should not force him to go there
They may be divided into three to four propagation groups, propagating gradually from the brothers' house to the outside
We ask You to burn us so that we would be neither cold nor lukewarm but that we would all be burning and boiling hot
As we began to change the system, we came back to the Bible and studied and researched the way to meet as it was in the beginning
Liberia also sent us a cable telling us that they had knocked on 218 doors, and as a result 146 people were baptized
The first one in our midst who took this way and brought this recovery and the light of this recovery to us was Brother Watchman Nee
It was in 1932 when Brother Nee came to visit Chefoo that we began the first church meeting in north China in my house
He said that all of Christianity focuses on the big meeting on the Lord's Day in which one person speaks and everyone else listens
Once we get up in the morning, we should call on the Lord's name, talk to Him, and read two verses of the Bible
Because we will be filled with the Holy Spirit, we will definitely open our mouths in the meeting, and living water will flow out from us
Fifty years ago Brother Nee gave some fellowship regarding changing the old system in the book called The Normal Christian Church Life
On the one hand, my work here in Taiwan was begun by the Lord, while on the other hand, it was arranged by Brother Nee
Before the work began in Taiwan, the Lord's recovery already had twenty-seven years of history in mainland China from 1922 to 1949
He said that to have the Lord's Day message meeting is to follow the customs of the nations and to do what the nations do
Later the children of Israel fell, and they followed the customs of the nations to worship God not in the temple but in various high places
The church has deviated from what God ordained in the New Testament-to worship Him in a way that is not under the influence of the world
Once God's people deviated from the God-ordained, unique way of worship, they fell into the Gentiles' way of meeting
More than fifty years ago the Lord showed us this mistake, but we have not begun to eliminate this mistake until now
Brother Nee said that it would not be easy to overthrow this tradition because it would require everyone to overthrow it together
Through the light in the book of Ezra we see that to change the system is actually to recover the genuine building of the temple of the Lord
There is no need for him to preach the gospel, to pray, or even to serve, because there are already some who can do these things properly
Many of us can testify that when we were first saved, we were inwardly touched very much and were full of zeal
Brother Nee said that this kind of Lord's Day meeting in which one person speaks and everyone else listens is very deadening
The result of people being deadened is that their spiritual function is completely nullified, and ultimately, there is no building up
Having clearly read these words again, we have been truly enlightened within, and we realize that these words are very serious
Fifty years ago Brother Nee pointed out that we do not need to maintain the Lord's Day message meeting, but we completely forgot this word
When we first came to Taiwan all of us were very pressed financially and were unable to offer anything for the purchase of the meeting halls
To change the system is not mainly to change our way of meeting but to bring the church back to her condition before the degradation
Three hundred people gather here on the Lord's Day, but only one speaking brother functions, and the rest of the people remain silent
When we first arrived in Taiwan, the brothers and sisters did not have much money, and the church also did not have much money
After passing through the training, they went out door-knocking and brought over twenty-eight thousand people to salvation
Brother Nee said in the past that we could not abolish the Lord's Day message meeting because we did not have something to replace it
These two matters must be implemented by the new way of meeting that we are implementing in changing the system
Never think that because you are old, do not have much physical strength, and cannot be very active, that you cannot follow the new system
You must realize that in the new system there are other matters besides door-knocking, which occupies only five percent of the new system
We need only to change our habit of not speaking and begin to speak at home and also to our friends and relatives and in the meetings
If all of us are willing to do this, the change in system will be successful, the Lord will be full of joy, and we also will be full of joy
If we get through in this matter, our change of system will be successful, and the new way will be opened to us
God has also led us to see in the past few years that this economy, which is the highest revelation, is the focus of the New Testament
There is a central purpose in God's economy, and there must be a means for this central purpose to be accomplished
Many Christians, however, have been meeting continually for decades and still do not know the purpose of their meetings
Most Christians think that the purpose of going to a meeting is to worship God, to learn the truth, and to receive some spiritual benefit
On one side it is to build up the believers in spirit , and on the other side it is to build up the Body of Christ in the spirit
To build with gold, silver, and precious stones is to build with the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The message we heard would be empty and vain, and we would be built with improper materials such as wood, grass, and stubble
If we want to minister the Triune God to one another, it must be done by speaking, speaking not ordinary words but the words of the truth
If everyone sits properly in the meeting and neither prays nor speaks, then of course we must rely on the preacher to speak by himself
The general situation is that no matter what kind of meeting we have, there is always one person speaking while everyone else listens
In August of 1948 we started our work in Taipei, and during the first few years there was a trend toward an increase in the number of saints
We who do business or teach are busy for five or six days a week, and on the Lord's Day we want to be more relaxed
Even though we may not understand what the choir sings or what the pastor preaches, these things are not bad and give us peace in our hearts
Doctors should be scientific doctors, lawyers should be scientific lawyers, and pastors should be scientific pastors
The second aspect of the central purpose of the meetings of the believers is to build up the Body of Christ in the spirit
In the various denominations in Christianity today we almost never hear messages on the building up of the Body of Christ
When the whole Body is joined and knit together, this causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love
It has been more than one thousand nine hundred years since they passed away, and there is still no trace of the Body of Christ
In the New Testament we cannot find a single example of a regular church meeting in which one person spoke and everyone else listened
After they broke the bread, everyone continued conversing and fellowshipping all the way until daybreak, at which time they saw Paul off
Corinthians 14 shows us that when the whole church came together for a big meeting, more than one person spoke
As long as we bring our Bible bag to the meeting on the Lord's Day, our conscience will be all right because we do not need to speak
The new way of meeting will be beneficial to both the co-workers and the saints and will be a new beginning for them
When we looked into the reason, we found that it was the way of one person speaking that had killed everyone's function
If only one out of ten from these seven thousand baptized ones remains, we will still have around seven hundred people
When we went out, we endured the wind and rain and knocked on more than two hundred thousand doors in ten days
We immediately established home meetings at the homes of the saved ones to teach them the truths and to speak to them from the Life Lessons
Rather, we should lead him to open his mouth to pray, confess, deal with his sins, release his spirit, and exercise his spirit
When he first begins, he may speak only from his throat and not from his spirit, but gradually we can lead him to speak from his spirit
In this way when he comes to the meeting, he will be able to speak by faith and will have the Holy Spirit poured out upon him
We all will be living people, speaking the words of the truth in the meetings and building up others' spirits and the Body of Christ
Through the studies and experiments we carried out in the training, the Lord is leading us to take an unprecedented new way
The training in Taipei during these few years has gathered saints from various places to labor together, and the result has been very good
By the end of the ten days of the feast, 7,825 people had been baptized and over a thousand homes had home meetings
After this global feasting event in Taipei, all of us now have the feeling that we absolutely cannot go back to take the old way
During the past twenty years, the number of Christians in Christianity and its various denominations in the world has also been declining
The meetings according to the Bible are not one-sided but mutual, full of everyone speaking and listening to one another
Our failure in these three matters prevented us from propagating and spreading and caused us to remain in a lukewarm condition
We must see that the old system does not have any retaining value and that we have to rise up to take the biblical way
The effort required to look up words in the dictionary, to read, to memorize, and to study is called diligence
We all must realize that for us to serve the Lord, we cannot follow a routine, stick to the old way, or enjoy ease and comfort
Regarding establishing a habit of preaching the gospel, we are not saying that every saint has to go door-knocking
When we go out door-knocking, we often encounter many unpleasant faces, and it is a common thing for people to slam their doors in our face
The method in the old way was to invite people to the meeting hall, but the spirit of the new way is to deliver the gospel to people's homes
Later, there was still room, so the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in'
We first have to knock on the doors of our friends and relatives, then the doors of our neighbors, and then those of the community
In each locality, from the beginning of the year to the end, at least one-fourth of the saints should go out door-knocking
With this kind of spirit, we will be able to spread the gospel to every household and even to the entire earth
If in a small group meeting of ten saints, three to four saints speak in a living way, the meeting will be living
Even though we may not have a set topic, it will be a rich feast because there will not be merely one dish and one flavor
Someone may speak about patience, someone else may speak about love, and someone may speak about following the spirit
There are also many other spiritual publications such as the Lifestudy of the Bible and Truth Lessons from which we can fellowship and share
Today to change the system is not to change our ground but to change our existing method while remaining on this ground
We all admit that the condition of our meetings and the way in which we met in the past did not match the pattern in the Bible
We who serve the Lord must first see the church, and for us to see the church, we must see the ground of the church
The most serious matter related to our service is how to meet, because all of our service hinge on the meetings
They either meet with people in home meetings, invite people to small group meetings, or they themselves join the district meetings
Many Christian groups not only do not have any building, but they do not even mention the matter of building; they disregard it
Today there are both many Christians and many Christian organizations on the earth, but still we cannot find any building
In the past, almost sixty to eighty percent of the way we met was influenced by the traditions of Christianity
The change in system will enable our meetings to fulfill their function and to cause the building up of the saints and the church
We must see the church, and second, we must see that the way and system of the service in the church is related to how we meet
At the most we will be able to listen to others' speaking, but we will not be able to speak to and supply others
When we come to the meetings, everyone will have both the Spirit and the word and will be able to supply others at the proper time
The new way comprises not only door-knocking but also taking care of the home meetings and small group meetings
Whenever the church carries out an activity, some people like to look on with a critical eye and say vague things
Many people do not realize that the change in system to take the new way requires them to come back to meet in the Body
Perhaps we may be able to bring people to salvation, but we will not be able to build them up because our meetings are not proper
If we want to talk about the church, we must have the vision of the church, and we must stand on the ground of the church
The reason that our gospel is not strong is that we do not have the kind of living that we mentioned earlier as our base
If we truly had that kind of living and meeting, our preaching of the gospel and gaining of people would surely be effective
In the past our work did not have much impact because our system was wrong and because we were off, particularly in the matter of meeting
Now the most important thing is that four groups of people-the elders, the co-workers, the full-timers, and the trainees-go on together
If these four groups of people do not go on and enter into the new way, it will be very difficult for the churches to go on
If these four groups of people take the lead to enter in and go on in life, then the saints will be able to follow
In the meetings we still may not know when we should open our mouths and when we should not, but this does not matter
If the Lord has not arranged the environment for you to have a job and is allowing you to serve full-time, this is a great mercy
Answer: Actually, there should be some full-timers who labor in the schools and some who work in the communities
You have to carry out this way personally, and as you are doing it, you have to study it and fellowship with the more experienced ones
The prospects of what you have fellowshipped may be very good, but it will take a period of time to work this out
Because many people have not entered into and do not understand what we are doing, they may say their own things and may even criticize us
What we have been doing in these two to three years is, as one brother said, like beginning to learn how to walk
Question: Since full-timers are so important, should we lead the students under our care to join the full-time training?
If you can break through in this matter, it will be easier for those who follow, and a great part of the situation will be set
We truly praise the Lord for the change of system in the past, and we also rely on Him for the change of system in the future
In addition, sometimes while we are trying to take this way, it seems that although the engine is running, the car is not moving
In 1984 when we mentioned the change in system, we never thought that it would require so much work and so many people
We were walking as we were trying to take this way, and we were studying this way while we were working it out
Our leading co-worker, Brother Watchman Nee, once said that our way of meeting on the Lord's Day followed the custom of the nations
We also observed that the churches in both places were not moving and that there was no increase in the number of saints
The church in Taipei is big, the number of saints is great, the saints' momentum is strong, and there is a practical one accord
In the medical office there are American doctors and Chinese doctors and also American nurses and Chinese nurses
The new ones who had been saved through the training and the saints in the church were fully blended into a hundred booths
Many elderly saints put on their training uniforms and joined the training, so the situation of the small groups became even worse
When we invited them to the meeting hall, they were not willing to come, but they were willing to meet in the homes
Because some of them take turns coming to the meetings, the actual number in the meetings is around three thousand
During the past year and a half more than thirty thousand people have been baptized through the trainees' door-knocking
Among these thirty thousand new ones, only five thousand are being taken care of and remain due to the lack of laborers
The trainees have been laboring every day without stopping in order to take care of these five thousand people
Besides these, we gained one thousand seven hundred to one thousand eight hundred people through our door-knocking during the feast
According to the statistics from last Lord's Day, the number of those who now come to the district meetings is close to four thousand
Having had the tabernacle meeting of the feast, we feel that now is the best time to carry out the change in system
A district meeting should have fifty people in principle, although a meeting of forty people would also be acceptable
In this way, our function will be manifested, and at the same time our caring and shepherding will be more thorough
After adding the college-age young people, this number comes to one thousand three hundred to one thousand four hundred
When the saints come together, each one should have an exhortation, an encouragement, a question, or a word of consolation
Corinthians 1426 says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
If you receive something from your propagation group at home then when you go to the meeting in the evening you have to sell what is in you
The biblical principle is that if you give, it will be given to you, but if you keep, even what you have kept will be taken from you
It is a heart-breaking matter to see one who has been meeting among us for decades and yet has not produced or manifested any gift
If the saints are willing to practice speaking a little bit more each time they meet, in a year they will be able to speak for five minutes
If we quarrel with our neighbor at home and then come to the meeting in the evening, we will be unable to say 'Hallelujah'
When people scold us, we still have to smile at them, and when they slam the door on us, we still have to say good-bye to them
Our estimation is that it is sufficient for twenty-five out of a hundred saints in a meeting to go door-knocking
Whoever wants to go door-knocking should go, and whoever does not want to go should not go, but he should not criticize those who go
It was not Zaccheus the tax collector who found the Lord Jesus, but it was the Lord Jesus who went to the tax collector
The Lord also sent out His seventy disciples to people's houses, saying that peace would rest upon the sons of peace who deserved it
In the Bible the Lord Jesus not only visited people by Himself, but He also sent out His twelve disciples, and then the seventy, two by two
If we apply this principle, in less than twenty years almost every door in the whole world will have been knocked on
Every morning in the homes the husband and wife should practice to have a family propagation group by pray-reading two verses
Those who do not usually speak should not think that since there are speaking ones already, they can continue to not speak
If we are not willing to take this way, the Lord will suffer a great loss, and we ourselves will suffer a great loss
Sadly, however, the preaching and concepts of Christianity are too superficial and natural and are altogether according to the human concept
Outwardly speaking, the human body seems to be quite simple, but inwardly it is very complicated and mysterious
When we say that a person is 'filled with economy,' we mean that when he works, he is full of plans, agendas, and methods
The reason that the world is in a state of restless dispute is that man has denied Christ as the Head of the universe
When Paul spoke about this marvelous and wonderful mystery he did not know how to describe it so he said what the economy of the mystery is
It denotes a household management or administration, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration
The riches of Christ are who He is, what He has, and what He has accomplished, attained to, and obtained for us
In this universe there is the earth, which is a globe enveloped by a layer of air, and there are various living creatures upon the earth
God created man in three parts-the spirit in the inmost part, the soul in the inside, and the body on the outside
People usually confuse the spirit with the soul and are unable to distinguish between the spirit, the soul, and the heart
The purpose of God in creating man was to create a vessel for Himself that man would be able to receive and contain Him
A radio has an outer shell, but its most important part is its inner receiver, which enables it to receive the outward radio waves
Because of the fall and man's sins, the spirit of the people in the world is deadened and has become like a broken radio receiver
He also passed through human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, was made Lord and Christ, and became the life-giving Spirit
Today His divine attributes, His human virtues, and His unsearchable riches are all contained in the life-giving Spirit
As far as man's physical life is concerned, eating is not as important as drinking, and drinking is not as important as breathing
The Lord Christ is the God who created all things, became a man, passed through human living, died on the cross, and was resurrected
In resurrection He came back to His disciples in the form of the Spirit and breathed into them that they might receive the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit whom Christ became and the breath of life who comes into us to be our life
Once this person receives God's life, this life will begin to function in him so that he may be sanctified and gradually transformed
When God's chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches constitute them into the church
Through the church, the angels-the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies-may know the multifarious wisdom of God
All of us were damaged by Satan, and all of us are fallen, have sinned, and were corrupted to the point that we were dead
Now we are not only regenerated but are being sanctified and transformed to become a corporate person-the Body of Christ, the church
We must know these deep truths properly, study them thoroughly, dive into them, and speak them to people using everyday language
May God bless us to pursue this way from our youth that we would be those who are blessed in God's New Testament economy
In the denominations and in our past way of meeting people were required to attend the Lords Day service but were not required to be revived
His dining table in his home was used for the Lord's table in the morning and then for playing mah-jongg after the meeting
Today if we want to take the way of the recovery as revealed in the Bible, we have to be those who overcome and those who love the Lord
In other words, we must fellowship with the Lord every moment, live in the spirit every day, and walk according to the spirit
Otherwise, when we come to the meeting, we will have a meeting in which one person speaks and everyone else listens
The new way today, however, requires not merely one person to stand at the podium, but it requires everyone to 'stand at the podium'
The kind of meeting that is revealed in the Bible is one in which everyone functions by praying, singing, speaking, and testifying
We must be those who love the Lord, who are consecrated to Him, who fellowship with Him, and who walk according to the spirit
Some people have asked why we should preach the gospel through door-knocking and where the Bible mentions door-knocking
God did not give Adam a command from the throne to tell Adam to repent and confess; rather, He visited Adam personally
At that time everyone said that they did not have anyone to visit because there were not that many who had been recently saved
Due to an insufficient number of laborers we cannot visit all these ones but even though this is the case we still have to take care of them
We have their addresses and telephone numbers, so we all have to bear this heavy burden to care for these ones together
There are more than 600 high school young people and more than 500 to 600 junior high young people, totaling around 14,000
Among the 2,200 recovered ones, most of them are willing to have small group meetings with those in their neighborhood
Among these ones, less than 1,000 are presently willing to have small group meetings, but this number is gradually increasing
According to our observation, the first function of the elderly saints is that they must follow in their spirit
They need only to speak a few sentences at crucial junctures, and by doing this the young ones will receive the needed help
Some of these students may be weak physically, may have done something wrong, or may have encountered some frustrations
In the work with the students, matters related to marriage and making friends require the teaching and protection of the elderly saints
Most of the young people who come to study or work in factories are like children wandering around, without being properly cared for
We hope that we will be able to work out a model here in three to five years, then we will help the churches in other regions
We may not be able to see the success in our lifetime, but we can have the assurance that the new way will eventually be successful
When we considered buying land to build a big meeting hall, many people said to me, 'Brother Lee, why do you have to do this?
Since the Lord gave us the burden to change the system, we believe that one day the churches in Taiwan will have such a need
Today my labor and work on the Recovery Version of the New Testament is the same-I am doing this work because there is truly the need
We need a good translation that contains the supply of life and shining of light so that the saints may freely use it
We want to do all that we can to keep the revelations that we receive while we are here on the earth to become the property of the church
Please pray for this matter and ask for the covering of the Lord's precious blood because this is merely the beginning
