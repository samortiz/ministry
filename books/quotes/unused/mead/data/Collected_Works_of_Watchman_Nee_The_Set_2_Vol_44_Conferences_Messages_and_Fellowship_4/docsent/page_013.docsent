   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETY-ONE GOD'S PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 1:28 tells us that after God created man, He blessed him and told him to be "fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion" over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, God wants to deal with death by life through man's multiplication, and on the other hand, God gave Adam the authority to have dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This position and authority once belonged to Satan, but now God has replaced him with man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 2:15 says, "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows that there was decay and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, there is the need for man to recover the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From these two passages we see that God has a fourfold intention in creating man: 1 multiplying dealing with death; 2 having dominion dealing with insubordination; 3 keeping dealing with attacks; and 4 dressing dealing with corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD, MAN, AND SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, Genesis 2 shows us two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>9, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle of the tree of life is dependence on God, and the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is independence and alienation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are the acts of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's will is done in heaven, while Satan's will is carried out in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's independent right is exercised on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the question is which side man will stand on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eating of the tree of life means to join oneself to God, whereas eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil means to join oneself to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PSALM 8</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we come to Psalm 8, we can once again see that God's desire is related to man; He wants man to reign for Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews 2:5-10 tells us the way the Lord fulfills Psalm 8, whereas 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 tells us the time the Lord fulfills it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Psalm 8 places special emphasis on the earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It also emphasizes the name and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Three things in Psalm 8 match Matthew 6:9-10: 1 God's name being sanctified, 2 God's kingdom coming, and 3 God's will being done on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 8 does not concern the new heaven and new earth, because there will be no sea in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 8 concerns the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 1 says, "O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth,/You who have set Your splendor above the heavens!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This tells us that God's glory is set above the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 2 says, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings / You have established strength/Because of Your adversaries, / To stop the enemy and the avenger."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Babes are the youngest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as the duration of the universe is concerned, man is a babe and a suckling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's intention is to deal with His enemy Satan through man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 21:16, the Lord quotes this verse, saying, "You have perfected praise."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows that there is a question of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here is spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Psalm 8:3 says, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This psalm was written in the night and therefore does not mention the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 4 says, "What is man, that You remember him,/And the son of man, that You visit him?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to marvel at God's selection of man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 5 says, "You have made him somewhat lower than angels/And have crowned him with glory and honor."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His creation, God has made man a little lower than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, man's position before God is higher than that of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has made man a little lower than angels temporarily Heb 2:5-10 in order to crown him with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A crown is a sign of reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Crowning man with glory and honor means that man is placed in the highest position and is made to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Psalm 8:6-8 says, "For You have caused him to rule over the works of Your hands;/You have put all things under his feet:/All sheep and oxen,/As well as the beasts of the field, /The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea,/Whatever passes through the paths of the seas."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God gave man the authority to have dominion over all things because He wants man to deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is ordained by God at the foundation of the world and will be manifested in the age of the kingdom Heb 2:5-10 .</S>
