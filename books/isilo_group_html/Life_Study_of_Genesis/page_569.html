Soaking Our Behavior in the Enjoyment<br>of the Riches of Christ's Life</H2><P>Verse 11 also says, "He washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes." Years ago, I could not understand what it meant to wash our garments in wine and our clothes in the blood of grapes. In the Bible our behavior in our daily living is likened to garments. Figuratively speaking, garments or clothes signify our behavior. They represent our walk and acts. Hence, to wash our garments in wine and our clothes in grape juice signifies that we soak our behavior, our daily walk, in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ's life.</P><P>Both grape wine and grape juice are for nourishment. Grape juice is mainly for quenching our thirst, whereas grape wine is mainly for stirring up our excitement. Our thirst needs to be quenched, but our excitement needs to be stirred up. Every Christian must be "crazy," beside himself, in a proper sense. Every Christian who binds his donkey to the vine will be happy and excited. This is the function of grape wine. The grape juice that we drink is for quenching our thirst. On the one hand, the rich Christ stirs up our excitement; on the other hand, He quenches our thirst. We need to soak our behavior, our daily walk and actions, in the rich enjoyment of Christ's life. Then our behavior will be permeated and saturated with the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ's life. Then others will say, "Look at these Christians. Look at how they live and conduct themselves. Surely there must be something to what they are." This something is the rich life of Christ as the cheering wine to stir us up and as quenching juice to satisfy us. Such Christians are happy, satisfied, excited, and even beside themselves with joy. Because they are so excited, they become exciting. Their behavior, their daily walk, and all their actions are full of Christ's life as wine and as juice.</P><P>Are you the kind of Christian who is always dissatisfied? Are you a Christian who does not know how to be happy, who always has a wrinkled brow and a long face, who always looks sad? All those in the kingdom of Christ must be smiling, happy, pleasant, excited, cheerful, and satisfied. This indicates that we are soaking our behavior in the rich enjoyment of the life of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_568.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_570.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 569</div><br></body></html>
