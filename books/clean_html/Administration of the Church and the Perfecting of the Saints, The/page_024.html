<h1 class="title">COORDINATING IN LOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:31; 13:1-8, 13; 14:1; 8:1</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider love. Love is an important item that we are familiar with but neglect.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWLEDGE AND GIFTS NOT BEING LIFE</h2>
<p>First Corinthians deals with the problems of speaking in tongues, knowledge, and gifts. In chapter 1 Paul told the believers in Corinth, &ldquo;In everything you were enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge...so that you do not lack in any gift&rdquo; (vv. 5, 7). The Corinthian believers had problems because they were rich in knowledge and gifts and lacked nothing. They were rich in knowledge and were well-gifted, but they were disorderly. The New Testament reveals that the church in Corinth was a very disorderly church; no local church was as disorderly as the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>The church in Corinth was not only disorderly; it was also sinful and was not even clear concerning idols. It is remarkable that they were rich in knowledge and had many gifts and yet were disorderly, sinful, and involved with idols. This shows that knowledge is not life, and gifts are not life. At the end of chapter 1 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption&rdquo; (v. 30). God made Christ wisdom to us as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. God did not make Christ our knowledge, eloquence, or gift.</p>
<p>Some may not appreciate this word, because spiritual knowledge, eloquence, and gifts are highly regarded among Christians. A person who can speak clearly, logically, and engagingly with clever words, quoting verses and telling stories with parables, is considered to be a first-rate preacher. Famous preachers do not stammer, are eloquent, and have a resounding voice. As long as a person can stand up in a crowd and give a flowing and articulate speech with a voice that is resounding and melodious, he will be popular. He does not need to know how to give many messages, for if he can give thirty to fifty messages, he will be able to conduct revival meetings and will be welcomed everywhere.</p>
<p>Famous preachers, however, damage the church because they form their own sects. When a preacher becomes famous and popular, he will form a sect. This happens in the West and also in the East. The older saints who became Christians at a young age have watched Christianity for over half a century. During this time there was not one famous Chinese preacher who did not form his own sect, and no two famous preachers have been able to cooperate with each other. Even though such preachers made lofty statements, claiming to be one in Christ, to believe in the same Lord, to have the same faith, and to be the Lord&rsquo;s servants, they could not work together but rather were jealous of one another.</p>
<p>We must see that eloquence, knowledge, and gifts are damaging. Paul did not use words such as <em>vipers</em> or <em>fierce beasts</em> to describe the believers in Corinth; rather, he was cautious in his words to them. He told the Corinthians that although they had all eloquence and all knowledge and did not lack in any gift, he would show them a most excellent way. No way is more excellent than love (12:31&mdash;13:3).</p>
<p>The Corinthians wanted eloquence, knowledge, and gifts, but they were not spiritual. Paul called them fleshy (3:1). Likewise, many people today care about the outward manifestation of gifts but not the indwelling Spirit. Furthermore, some of the so-called tongues spoken by the Pentecostal Christians are not genuine tongues. What came out of the mouth of Balaam&rsquo;s donkey was an authentic and genuine tongue (Num. 22:28-30). But even if people speak in genuine tongues, Paul considered such ones as sounding brass and clanging cymbals, being without life (1 Cor. 13:1).</p>
<p>Some are eloquent but are sounding brass and clanging cymbals; others stammer but are outlets of life. Which kind of believer do we prefer? Many would prefer sounding brass and clanging cymbals instead of stammerers, but Paul said that the lifeless gifts, the sounding brass and clanging cymbals, caused problems in the church. The Corinthians treasured the gifts; they felt that Paul was good, that Apollos was good, and that Cephas was good. Paul, Apollos, and Cephas suited three kinds of human taste. Hence, some in Corinth said that they were of Paul, others said that they were of Apollos, and still others said that they were of Cephas (1:12). Thus, the church in Corinth had strife, factions, and sects.</p>
<p>The believers in Corinth did not lack in any gift (v. 7), but instead of being spiritual, they had strong natural tastes. Factions arise when there is a preference for and an appreciation of different tastes. For example, spicier foods match the Szechuan taste, and blander foods match the Beijing taste. In serving the church, our spiritual taste should be as indistinct as possible. We should not have a sense of &ldquo;spice&rdquo; or &ldquo;blandness,&rdquo; nor should we be attracted by an &ldquo;aroma&rdquo;; we should have regard only for eating until we are satisfied. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace we should not be picky about the &ldquo;taste&rdquo; of the meetings; we should simply eat. When the saints rise up to testify or release the word, we should not have any preferences. We simply receive Christ and the supply of life.</p>
