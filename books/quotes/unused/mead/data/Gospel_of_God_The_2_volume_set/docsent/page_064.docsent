   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What then is Christ's redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The redemptive work of Christ is God Himself coming to bear man's sin against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This word is more lovely to the ear than all the music in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the redemptive work of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is God bearing that with which man has sinned against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, if Jesus of Nazareth was not God, He would not be qualified to bear our sins righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus of Nazareth was God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the very God whom we sinned against.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our God has come down to earth personally and borne our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, it is God rather than man who has borne our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why it was a righteous bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot bear it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we were to bear it, we would be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank God that He Himself has come to the world to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why then did God have to become a man?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is good enough for God to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why did He have to give His only begotten Son?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One has to realize that man has sinned against God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God requires man to bear his sin, how can he do it?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When sin motivates and acts within, it ends in death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death is the rightful penalty of sin Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When man sins against God, he has to bear the consequence of sin, which is death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, God is the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He is to come and take up our responsibility and bear the consequence of our sin, He has to die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But 1 Timothy 6:16 tells us that God is immortal; He cannot die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although God is willing to come into the world and bear our sins, and although He is willing to die and go into perdition, it is impossible for Him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Death has simply no effect on God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no possibility for God to die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, for God to bear the judgment of man's sin against Him, He has to take on the body of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why Hebrews 10:5 tells us that when Christ came into the world, He said, "A body You have prepared for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has prepared a body for Christ so that Christ could offer Himself up as a burnt offering and sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord says, "In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not delight" v. 6 . Now He is offering up His own body to deal with man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the Lord Jesus became a man and came into the world to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus is not a third party; He is the first party.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because He is God, He is qualified to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because He is man, He can die on the cross on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must distinguish between these two statements clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is qualified to be crucified because He is God, and He is able to be crucified because He is man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the opposite party; He has stepped over to man's side to suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has come among man, joined Himself to man, taken up man's burden, and borne all his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If redemption is to be righteous, Jesus of Nazareth must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Jesus of Nazareth is not God, redemption is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every time I look at the cross, I say within myself, "This is God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He is not God, His death becomes unrighteous and it cannot save us, for He is but a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But thank and praise the Lord, He is the party opposite us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is why I made the statement that only two parties are able to deal with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One is we ourselves, in which case we have to die ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The other party is the God whom we have sinned against, in which case He dies for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Other than these two parties, no third party has the right or authority to deal with our sins.</S>
