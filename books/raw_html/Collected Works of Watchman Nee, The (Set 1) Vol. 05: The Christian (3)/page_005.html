<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE NINETEEN</H2><P>Verse 19:"I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first." </P><P>The Son of God is now turning His attention to the work of His church. First He mentions love, because love is the first item among all good works. The church has not lost its love. Hence, the Lord praises it. Neither has it lost the facts and the doctrines that the Lord has revealed to it. Hence, the Lord praises its faith. It is also diligent in supplying the physical and spiritual need of others. Furthermore, in the matter of endurance, it is especially commendable. In the original language there is the word "your" before the word endurance. The Lord's purpose is to particularly commend its endurance. This is why He says "your endurance," as if to draw others particularly to their endurance. Moreover, it has not diminished in its good works but has increased. This is absolutely different from the church in Ephesus.</P><P>Surely these are not the works of Jezebel and her children. Jezebel is the turning point for the nature of the work of the whole church at that time. When we read on, we will see that these works were inherited from the church at that time; they have nothing to do with Jezebel. Before He rebukes them, He first gathers all their bright works and commends them. Because the background at that time was so dark, these works shine out all the more brightly.</P><P>We know that the church in Thyatira refers to the age of the Roman Catholic Church in the Middles Ages. We must never forget this point. Otherwise, we will not be able to understand much of what is covered in this letter. Since Thyatira is the church of the Dark Ages in the Middles Ages, how can the Lord have so many praises for it? We have to remember the biblical principle that when the whole body fails, God reckons the faithful remnant as those who take the place of the whole body before God. For example, at the time of the apostasy of the nation of Judah, God reckoned the remnant of Judah the nation of Judah. The same is true in the church of God. It is according to this principle that our Lord takes the works of the faithful believers in Thyatira to be the work of the whole body in Thyatira.</P><P>It is a joy to think that there was such love, faith, and work at that time in the Dark Ages. Many writings have been handed down to us that show us how these ones loved the Lord and suffered for the Lord. Although these extant writings are few, they can fairly represent the work of the minority of saints in the church at that time. We know, of course, that there were many other believers who loved the Lord and likewise suffered for Him but who are unknown to us because they were not able to write. We also know that many writings are lost and are no longer available to us. In conclusion, in such a dark time it is amazing that these ones could have such works. The darker the hour, the more precious the faithful works done for the Lord become.</P><P>We can say that stories of the believers in the Middle Ages are most interesting. They are also very moving. Their faithfulness in loving the Lord, in standing for the truth, and their determination of opposition to a heretical church are most sincere. Although they suffered, labored, and were threatened and persecuted, although they suffered much more than those under the Roman emperors suffered, although they did not witness any miracles and wonders or have any organization or group to back them up, and although the people and the priests of the time invented many condemnations against them, they marched on fearlessly to maintain God's testimony and were willing to sacrifice all comfort, their families, lives, and everything in the world to testify for the Son of God that the power of Hades would not be able to overcome the church. Christ knew all these things. Although they were at times weak, and their concepts were wrong in many things, and although Satan used all his wiles to mix errors with their good works and was sometimes quite successful at that, their works were recorded in heaven and were commended by Christ. While the writings of many world-lovers and comfort-seekers have disappeared and turned into dust, the record of the believers' works is shining brightly in heaven. This is the way the Lord commended the saints in Thyatira. They were not among those in the church then and are not among those who are wise now. They are just the ones who are totally for Christ. We have to take note of the Lord's commendation of Thyatira. It does not mean that everyone in Thyatira had such good works. Rather, it was only those faithful ones in Thyatira that had these good works. This is what is revealed in verse 24: "But I say to youâ€”the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching...." Clearly the Lord has separated the whole body in Thyatira from the remnant in Thyatira. If we notice the order of the Lord's word here, we will be clearer concerning this matter. The works of the whole body in Thyatira were the works of the Pope. Yet his works before God had no merit. However, the Lord Jesus is here commending one kind of work. It is then very clear that this kind of work is not the works of the Pope.</P><P>The Lord Jesus mentions love first because love is God's nature. Hence, love is the motive behind all spiritual works. After this, the Lord mentions faith, the faith which issues forth from love. Later the Lord mentions service, endurance, and good works. When believers increase in their love and good works in the midst of the fires that befall them, they receive the Lord's commendation. The whole body of Thyatira has followed the teaching of the Pope. They have reckoned work to be of merit before God for their salvation. This is totally different from the order presented here. There must first be love, then faith, and then afterwards service and good works.</P><P>Hence, when we read of the Lord's word of praise, we should distinguish the ones to whom these words were addressed from Jezebel and her children. Although we know little of how these ones walked humbly and secretly with God at the time when the Roman Catholic Church was dominating everything and the Pope had haughtily placed himself in an improper position, the most comforting thing is to see that Christ fully acknowledged their good faith and declared it before all men. Although many believers at that time were wrongly accused and were branded as heretics, and although many believers were given the meanest and most frightening judgment by the Roman Catholic Church, at the day when the Lord of judgment appears, they will receive their rightful crown. Jezebel was constantly testifying against God's Naboth, condemning him as having "blaspheme[d] God and the king" (1 Kings 21:10). Yet, for what reason was she doing this? Was it not for the reason that he would not sell his possession for a small price? All those who will not sell their possession for a small price in the world will be slandered as being blasphemous to God and the king and will be "stoned to death." Under these circumstances, can one imagine what kind of trials there were for the works, love, and faith of these nameless, or rather "ill-famed" Thyatiran believers? How is it that under such discouraging circumstances they were still so diligent? For one to be able to endure under such circumstances is true endurance indeed!</P><P>However, their highest attainment had not been achieved yet. God's work of power is unlike man's feeble struggling. Their last works were not only a match to the first; their "last works are more than the first." Under such adverse circumstances where all the powerful rulers of the world rose up to oppose them, it was difficult enough to maintain the same attitude as before. Yet what they did was more than before. This is indeed a growth. Thank and praise the Lord that He has given us eternal life and that with this life there is the divine power. As such, it is unavoidable that it grows. Although the bondages are strong, He is able to break them all. Although He is tightly shut up, He breaks out from within. The Holy Spirit is indeed powerful in our lives. Is there any hindrance in the world that can stop us from advancing for the Lord? All the sojourners who have passed the valley of Baca (the valley of tears, Psa. 84:6) will go from strength to strength, for the power of Christ is made perfect in weaknesses.</P><P>If we read the history of the day, we will see that the zeal of these enduring witnesses increased day by day. The light they received increased day by day, and their boldness also increased more and more. The Reformation that happened later was not a sudden occurrence. There were many forerunners before the Reformation already. Although one died, another was raised up. The torch of truth was transferred from one hand to another, and the more time went on, the brighter the torch became. Furthermore, the teaching of separation became more and more apparent as time went on. This is the greatest and the most crucial point, because when we read on, we find the Lord Jesus rebuking the saints for the reason that they had tolerated the teaching of Jezebel. Although sin increased and pressures mounted, the voice of testimony of those who opposed this kind of work became louder. It was this gradual increase that eventually made the success of the Reformation possible.</P><P>Although they were full of power and zealous works, among them the greatest sin was already at work. Although the Lord gladly acknowledged their abundant goodness, the most shameful thing existed among them. Although the Lord did praise them, He could not refrain from rebuking them.</P>
