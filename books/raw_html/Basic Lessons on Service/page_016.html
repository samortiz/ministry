<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) To Have Fellowship in the Blood of Christ</H2><P>Drinking the cup also indicates that we have fellowship in the blood of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16a). We have a joint and mutual participation in the drinking of the one cup. Both eating and drinking indicate oneness and fellowship, communion. This is why we have only one loaf, not many loaves, and only one cup, not many cups, at the table. One loaf and one cup indicate the oneness and the fellowship, the communion. This communion, this fellowship, is in both the mystical Body of Christ and in the redeeming blood of Christ. Because we all are redeemed by this one blood, we have the one communion, and through this we receive the unique blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. To Display the Lord's Death</H2><P>At the Lord's table, we do not remember the Lord's death, but we declare, proclaim, display, the Lord's death. First Corinthians 11:26 says, "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes." Here we have the bread signifying the Lord's body, and we have the cup signifying the Lord's blood. On the Lord's table, His death is displayed, because the cup is separate from the bread, that is, the blood is separate from the body. We eat the bread and we drink the cup to display the Lord's death, because whenever the blood is separate from the body, that is death. Whenever we eat the bread and drink the cup, we do not remember the Lord's death but we display His death to the whole universe, especially to the principalities and powers in the heavenlies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. To Express Our Desire<br>of the Lord's Coming Back</H2><P>We also remember the Lord at His table to express our desire of His coming back. First Corinthians 11:26b says that we display the Lord's death until He comes. While we display the Lord's death, we express our desire of the Lord's second coming. In Matthew 26:29 the Lord said, "I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father." This is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, in which the Lord will drink with us after His coming back. When we remember the Lord and display His death, we express our desire that the Lord will come back soon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. To Worship the Father</H2><P>After all of this, the Lord will lead us to worship the Father. This is based upon Matthew 26:30, which says that after the Lord finished His supper with His disciples, He and the disciples sang a hymn. That hymn was sung by the Lord with His disciples to the Father. In the Lord's table, the Lord takes the lead to praise the Father, to worship the Father. At the end of the Lord's table meeting, we need to worship the Father with the Lord. We must follow the firstborn Son to worship the Father as His brothers. The Lord as the firstborn Son takes the lead to worship the Father (Heb. 2:12), and we as His many brothers follow Him.</P>
