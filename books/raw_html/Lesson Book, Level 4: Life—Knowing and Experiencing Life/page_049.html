<h2 class=head1>VI. DEALING WITH SINS AND LIFE</h2><p>[Since dealing with sins has such a close relationship with our spiritual life, we should endeavor to experience this lesson continuously. Although this experience is not a deep one, yet no one can be so spiritual as to say that they have no need to deal with sins. It is difficult to graduate from this lesson. We should not only ask ourselves, therefore, if we have ever had these experiences, but we should also ask ourselves if we are now living in such an experience. We not only have to wash our face, but we need to wash it every day. If we washed our face three years ago and have not washed it since, it must be a dreadful looking face! In the same manner, unless we are free from committing sins every day, we need to deal with sins daily.]<p>We should keep a short account with the Lord concerning sins. When He exposes, we confess (agree), He forgives and cleanses, fellowship is restored, we receive life, we get filled with the Spirit, then we grow in life. It is so wonderful. Why argue with Him? In this way we get all that God is. His element will increase in us and our human element will decrease. What a way to grow in life! What a full salvation!
