[1]  The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE SERVING THE LORD BY CARING FOR PEOPLE Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:16a; Exo 21:5-6; Isa 50:4-5; Rom 12:11 THE NEED TO BE TRAINED FOR OUR SERVICE
[3]  Many Christians throughout the centuries have held to one of two extremes concerning our service to the Lord.
[4]  Certain spiritual persons insist that to serve the Lord is absolutely a matter of life.
[5]  They say that since we have life, we will grow in our service, so there is no need of any training.
[6]  Their feeling was that to serve the Lord is a matter of life, and as long as they had the growth in life, they did not need training.
[7]  Still, we cannot say that as long as we have the human life, we can grow in this life to be able to speak English.
[8]  In order for us to minister life to others, we must do at least four things.
[9]  First, we need an adequate contact with the Lord.
[10]  We must all purposely go to the Lord, not to pray for other things but simply to spend time with Him.
[11]  We all need to pray this way: Lord, I love You, I love Your church, and I love the saints.
[12]  We may pray, Lord, by my birth I love to talk to people in a natural way, but others may need to pray, Lord, I was born in a way that I do not like to talk to people.
[13]  CHAPTER TWO CARING FOR PEOPLE AS NURSING MOTHERS AND EXHORTING FATHERS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:7-8, 11; Matt 4:19; John 21:15; S. S. 1:7-8 DEALING WITH THE LIGHT WE RECEIVE
[14]  In the previous chapter we stressed the need to go to the Lord, deal with Him, and receive light from Him to be exposed.
[15]  We should not expect that one day the Lord will have mercy and shine His light on us in this way.
[16]  We do know what to do, but if we do not deal with what we see, we will not receive further light.
[17]  We do have light and sight, but we may not exercise our sight to see, and we may not care for what we see.
[18]  By the Lord s mercy, we may need to go to the Lord one night and say, Lord, I will not go to sleep or do anything else.
[19]  As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the church service is not mainly for doing things but for taking care of persons.
[20]  If we do a good job merely in the practical matters but do not take care of anyone, we are a failure.
[21]  If a sister asks us to clean her house, we may do it in half a day, but if she asks us to take care of her children, we would certainly refuse, because to do that is not in our blood.
[22]  If we do not have an interest in people, we are finished with the church service; we are not qualified to serve.
[23]  HAVING A HEART OF LOVE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE
[24]  We have tried many ways to gain the increase, but little has worked.
[25]  Recently, we changed from preaching the gospel in the meeting every week so that the saints could do the preaching in their homes.
[26]  There is no way that works if we do not have a care for and interest in people.
[27]  We should not say that we have no way or that no one will accept the gospel.
[28]  HAVING A CHANGE IN OUR DISPOSITION TO CARE FOR
[29]  Having a burden to care for others requires us to have a change in our disposition.
[30]  We do not contact people and invite them to our homes because they are not the same as we are.
[31]  Since we are the only ones who match our disposition, we only invite ourselves.
[32]  CHAPTER THREE BEARING FRUIT AS BRANCHES OF THE VINE AND
[33]  As we pray thoroughly, we should have the assurance that the Lord has given this burden to us and that we have returned the burden to the Lord.
[34]  The reason we do not care for anyone is that we are too raw ; we have not been dealt with adequately by the Lord.
[35]  It is due to our disposition that we have no interest in others, or even if we do have an interest in others, we are unable to minister life to them.
[36]  In the church we must have life, training, and fruit-bearing.
[37]  Every member of the church should be a branch that bears fruit.
[38]  Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit vv.
[39]  Therefore, we must realize that every branch in the vine must abide in the Lord to bear fruit.
[40]  According to the divine economy of the Bible, if we desire to receive, we need to give.
[41]  If we water others, we ourselves will be watered, and if we desire to grow in life, we need to help others to grow Prov 11:25 .
[42]  The way to receive is to give, and the more we give, the more we receive Luke 6:38; Acts 20:35 .
[43]  When we say we do not have, we lose what we have, but when we say we have something, we add to what we have.
[44]  Our disposition is the cause for our not bearing fruit and using our talent to care for people.
[45]  If we do not bear fruit, it is because we do not have the overflow of life; we are short and undersupplied by the inner life.
[46]  However, we are not superstitious to believe that as long as we have the divine life we can do everything and know everything already.
[47]  Many of us do not have the sense that if we do not bring people to the Lord, we are wrong.
[48]  If we lose our temper with our spouse, we immediately feel that we are wrong and are under condemnation, but if we have not borne fruit for many years, we may have no condemnation.
[49]  Regardless of how much we seek the Lord, the spiritual principle is that if we do not bear fruit, we are cut off from the enjoyment of Christ, the supply and riches of the vine.
[50]  Many people speak of the normal Christian life, but to be normal is not only to be freed from sin according to the experience of Romans 6.
[51]  If the Lord has mercy on us that we pick up the burden to bear fruit, we will immediately see that we must pay a price.
[52]  We should not wait to be appointed to be elders so that we may take care of others.
[53]  In the proper church life, we do not need pastors or good speakers to preach the gospel and care for others.
[54]  Instead, we desire that by the end of the year, at the latest, we would all bring one person solidly into the church life and be burdened to take care of one younger one.
[55]  If we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off from the enjoyment of Christ s life, and we will forfeit the lessons in our Christian life and church life.
[56]  If we would go to the Lord in this way and have a thorough dealing, the Lord will speak to us concerning a price we must pay or how we need to be broken and dealt with in certain matters.
[57]  If we do not listen to His speaking, we will be cut off from the enjoyment of the vine tree, but if we do listen, we will have the deep experience of the enjoyment of the Lord s riches.
[58]  The reason we are not clear concerning what to deal with and in what matters we must pay a price is that we are under a cloud, but if we listen to the Lord s speaking, our inward sky will be clear.
[59]  Then as we become normal, we will be the church in our locality composed of sound Christians who live a proper Christian life, not bothering people but impressing them that we in the church have something shining.
[60]  We should pray, not in a miraculous way but in a very normal, constant way that all the members in all the churches will be brought into the normal Christian life and church life with a proper preaching and that we will all bear fruit according to the principle of life.
[61]  TO LIVE A FRUIT-BEARING LIFE Scripture Reading: John 15:2, 5; 1:29, 32-48; Matt 4:13-16, 18-22 FRUIT-BEARING BEING THE NORMAL LIVING
[62]  Throughout the past centuries, many matters concerning the Christian life and church life were lost in the degradation of the church.
[63]  A proper Christian life is a fruit-bearing life, because we are the branches of the vine John 15:5 .
[64]  We do not need to make up our mind to endeavor to bring someone to the Lord each year.
[65]  Rather, we should all have a proper Christian life, a life with no distractions, frustrations, or addictions.
[66]  If you give me something, I will take it, but if You do not give it to me, I do not desire it.
[67]  If we pray in this way, we will be refreshed, and we will have a life that produces fruit.
[68]  Instead, what we need in the Lord s recovery is for many dear saints who love the Lord and mean business with Him to constantly be one with Him.
[69]  We must all be tested by the church life, by fruit-bearing, and by lamb-feeding because these are the three matters that kill our natural disposition.
[70]  The church life is a killing, not of the good things but mostly of our disposition.
[71]  A NORMAL LIVING OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: John 4:35-38; 21:15-17; 2 Tim 4:2 THE EXAMPLE OF THE LORD JESUS
[72]  To say give Me something to drink does not seem like a gospel message, but one sentence later the Lord Jesus was able to turn to the gospel, saying, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water v. 10 . The Lord Jesus preached the gospel not in the way of traditional Christianity but in a very spontaneous way.
[73]  The Lord Jesus was kind to her and did not rebuke her, but He said to her, You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly vv.
[74]  If we do not say, Lord, I have had five husbands, and the one I now have is not my husband, He will be gracious to confess this for us.
[75]  We should not say that it is winter and that we need to wait for spring to sow the seed.
[76]  In season is when we have the opportunity, and out of season is when we do not have an opportunity.
[77]  If we receive the Lord s mercy and enjoy His grace, we will all be built up in this life, and we will bear fruit and even double each year in a normal way.
[78]  If the older generation of saints were the only ones who met all year round, we will all be disappointed, but if every Lord s Day we have several new ones, our spirit will be uplifted.
[79]  It is not easy for Christians to understand what the real service is that we render to the Lord.
[80]  The natural thought is that anything we do for the Lord is a service.
[81]  We all need to be built up as the Body, the priesthood, and the spiritual house.
[82]  The building as God s goal is a crucial, significant, clear, and definite matter in the Bible, yet for almost two thousand years the Lord has not fully accomplished His purpose and attained His goal.
[83]  I learned from the teachers in the Brethren assemblies that Christ is the living stone, and we come to Him as living stones, but these teachers did not mention that the stones are for the building.
[84]  If we mean business to have a proper service group, we should go to the Lord to check whether or not we are priests, separated persons, holy and royal with a high standard.
[85]  We may be positive about the church at first, but soon afterward one of the elders may offend us, or we may be offended when we do not receive something we expected to receive.
[86]  The New Testament tells us that there are a few things that we must not tolerate.
[87]  If anyone worships idols, we should cleanse ourselves of him, and if a brother is in immorality, we must ask him to repent 1 Cor 5:11; 2 Tim 2:20-21 .
[88]  Likewise, we cannot tolerate division, and we will not receive anyone who denies that Jesus is the Son of God or claims that the Bible is not divinely inspired Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10; 1 John 4:2-3; 2 John 7, 10; 2 Tim 3:16 .
[89]  As long as we are one, we are right, but if we are not one, regardless of how right we feel that we are, we are wrong.
[90]  IN OUR CHURCH LIFE AND SERVICE Not Making Demands on Others
[91]  Then He acted as one who did not know anything, asking, What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking? v. 17 . One rebuked the Lord Jesus, saying, Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days? v. 18 . To be sure, Jesus knew much better than they did.
[92]  If we were the Lord Jesus, we might have said, Do you not know who I am?
[93]  CONCERNING SHEPHERDING Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:7, 11; 2 Cor 12:15; 1 Cor 4:14-15 A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING THE BUILDING UP
[94]  As we saw in the previous chapter, the main thing we need in the church service is the building up.
[95]  OUR NEED TO SHEPHERD OTHERS IN OUR DAILY LIFE
[96]  In this chapter we will speak concerning our need to shepherd people.
[97]  To speak about this is difficult, because this matter touches each one of us.
[98]  In 1956, when a servant of the Lord visited us in Taiwan, he recommended to us the political way to touch people.
[99]  In order to be the proper, normal members of the church in the Lord s recovery, we need to build up a daily life of the gospel, and we need to go to the Lord for Him to show us who should be under the care of our shepherding.
[100]  As human beings, we must believe in the Lord Jesus, and as believers, we have no choice but to take the way of the proper church life.
[101]  Brother Nee taught us to say, I don t know because, strictly speaking, we do not know much, and what we do know, we do not know thoroughly.
[102]  This is to consider that we are superior to them.
[103]  We need to be honest with the ones who are under our care, but we must still be restricted by the Lord not to make their decisions.
[104]  We should not go out to contact people with the concept that we can do many things or that we know many things.
[105]  in Order to Help Them in a Particular Way
[106]  If we do not know where we are or where those whom we contact are, our fellowship with them will be very general.
[107]  Then we will know where we are, and we will know where others are.
[108]  We will know what we are short of, and we will be able to help others to the extent of our own experience.
[109]  When I went to visit her, she testified that something serious had happened to her and that when she went to the Lord to inquire about it, the Lord spoke, To know Him and the power of His resurrection v. 10 . The next time I visited her, she testified that something even more serious had happened, but when she went to the Lord to inquire about it, He again spoke the same thing.
[110]  He may allow us to care for the experience of life, but he would not allow us to properly care for the church.
[111]  Many times we are foolish in the way we present the church to people.
[112]  When we are at high tide, we damage people by making the church to be everything, but once we realize what we have done, we are at low tide and stay away from the matter of the church.
[113]  Now we must be clear about the church, and we must know how to fight the battle for the church.
[114]  With some of the dear ones, we should not speak concerning the church too quickly, but with others, now is the time to tell them about the church.
[115]  Even if we are able to help people in the experience of Christ as life, if we cannot bring them into the proper church life, we are still short of God s economy.
[116]  We also need to help the ones under our care to learn how to take care of others.
[117]  However, if we do not know how to shepherd people in the experiences of life, we will not have much to speak of when we come together.
