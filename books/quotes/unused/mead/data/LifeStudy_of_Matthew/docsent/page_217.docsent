   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Man without the Marriage Garment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being Cast Out into the Outer Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 12 and 13 say, Friend, how did you come in here not having a marriage garment?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And he was speechless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The servants mentioned in verse 13 must be angels 13:41, 49 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be cast out into the outer darkness is not to perish; it is to be dealt with dispensationally for not having lived an overcoming life by Christ to qualify for participation in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom Col 3:4 , whereas the defeated ones will suffer discipline in outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the man without a marriage garment is cast into outer darkness, many Christian teachers say that he is a false believer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But how could a false believer be admitted to the marriage feast of Christ in the air?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reason many Christian teachers say that this man is an unbeliever is that they do not believe that a saved one can be punished by being cast out into outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, according to the Gospel of Matthew, believers may be subject to dispensational punishment, a subject covered more than once in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Few Christians believe that there will be such a punishment for the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But for more than forty years we have been teaching that we need to be overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are not overcomers will be excluded from the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium and will probably be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have seen that the man without a marriage garment is cast out into outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Notice that the Lord Jesus did not just say darkness, but outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible says clearly that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will come in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, there will be a sphere, a realm, of glory, and all the believers will be raptured to Him in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the air the Lord will set up the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the believers have been judged, the defeated ones will be put into outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This refers to the darkness outside the realm of the Lord s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason the Lord used the word outer to describe that darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be cast out into outer darkness is not to suffer eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament reveals that once a person has been saved, he is saved for eternity and can never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the so-called Arminian theology teaches that a person can be saved and then lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This, however, is contrary to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we cannot be lost, God may deal with us dispensationally.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past some have argued with me about this and said, How can a blood-washed and redeemed person still be punished by God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I replied, After you were washed by the Lord s blood and redeemed, did you not experience God s chastening for your wrongdoings?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Has not God punished you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Knowing that God may chastise those who sin after they have been saved, they lost the case.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others have argued that God chastises us only in this age while we are in the flesh; after the Lord comes back and we are raptured, they think there will be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To this I have said, Please do not hold this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not think that there can be no problems after resurrection and rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the sinners have died and are resurrected, they will be brought to the white throne for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This proves that resurrection does not solve all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think that death and resurrection will automatically rescue you from having problems in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God may still deal with you after your resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most Christians today reject the teaching concerning the dispensational punishment of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why so many are loose and careless in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead of fearing God s dispensational discipline, they say, I am saved, and the blood has washed me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If I do something wrong, the Lord may correct me a little.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But there will be no problems for me in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How misleading it is to hold a concept so contrary to the pure word of God!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we come back to the pure Word, we see that it is a serious matter to come to the marriage feast without the marriage garment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to read the book of Matthew with a sober mind and consider its teachings seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although this book has been buried for centuries, the Lord has opened it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some may argue that we do not adequately know the love of God and that we present God as One who is too hard and cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if God were loving according to their concept, how could He send an army to destroy the city of Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Romans 11 Paul says that God is kind, but also that He is severe and that we need to be serious with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When God is kind, He is truly kind; and when He is severe, He is very severe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has been severe with the Jews, and He will also be severe with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today there are many sugar-coated teachings in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some preachers dare not teach what they see in the Bible because they are concerned about losing their audience or offending others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, they sugar-coat many of their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But we must strip away the sugar-coating, come back to the pure Word, and see what the Lord has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need the sober word found in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Remember, one day you will be examined to see whether or not you have the second garment to qualify you for the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Get ready for this by preparing the second garment, the white linen, the surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May the Lord have mercy upon us for this!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My burden in this message is not to threaten you; it is to open the pure Word and give you a healthy dose that has no sugar-coating.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all are responsible to read the Lord s word and to give it thoughtful consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord s parable in 22:1-14 is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Anything given in a parable is important.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord would not have given this parable if what is conveyed in it were not significant.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many Being Called but Few Being Chosen</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In verse 14 the Lord concludes: For many are called but few are chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To be called is to receive salvation Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:2; Eph 4:1 , whereas to be chosen is to receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All believers have been called, but few will be chosen as overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The overcomers, the chosen ones, will be rewarded and qualified to participate in the marriage feast of the Lamb.</S>
