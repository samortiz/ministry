   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE EXPOSITION ON LUKE 17:20-37 Scripture Reading: Luke 17:20-37</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 20 and 21 the Pharisees asked a question "as to when the kingdom of God was coming."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord answered, "The kingdom of God is in the midst of you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the Pharisees were blind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord made it clear that it could not be said, "Behold, here it is! or, There!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This sentence is the key; it is used in verse 23 as well as in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God was coming, and the Lord simply answered, "It is in the midst of you."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But He reserved the explanation for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He immediately turned to them and explained.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Note, however, that the Pharisees' question referred to the kingdom, yet in His explanation the Lord referred to the Son of Man v. 22 . This is because the Son of Man is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever you have the kingdom of God in power, you have the Son of God in presence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 24 speaks of a day of manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have the presence of the Lord today, you have the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The kingdom is not a thing; it is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Where His presence, power, and glory are manifested in the earth, there you have the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At present it is a matter of extent, not of quality or nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 26 through 29 the Lord uses two illustrations from the Old Testament Noah and Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He relates them to the days of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are all familiar with the term "Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This term is used in Hebrews 2 which speaks of Christ as the Inheritor of the earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything God has is going to be deposited in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As God's "one new man," the corporate Man, He will receive His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will be glorified and will possess the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, something will happen to bring in the day of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There will be judgment on the earth and deliverance for the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Noah left and the flood came; Lot left and then the fire from heaven came.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord tried to draw some definite lesson from these two instances for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 31 is an exhortation to not go down into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 32 is a warning to "remember Lot's wife."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 33 points out that the way of escape is to lose the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A day is coming when all the "Noahs" and "Lots" will be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The "Noahs" and "Lots" will go by a specific call a shout, the voice of the archangel, a trumpet 1 Thes 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The case of Noah does not illustrate partial rapture, for he and his whole family were delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord did not draw His lesson for the discourse from Noah's story but from the story of Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He based His exposition on the story of Lot, and the warning is drawn from Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are told that if we have goods in the house, we should not come down to take them away; if we are in the field, we are not to turn back to the things behind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is all a matter of reacting to the divine call to "Come up here" Rev 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lot's wife received the call to go; she did not commit any sin, but there was a reaction of looking back, of turning back to her goods.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rapture will produce no miraculous change in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will only be a stepping away, and it will be a question of our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The things in verse 28, which occupy the lives of the people eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building were not sinful in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were perfectly legitimate, but there was no detachment from them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not necessarily sins which will be the hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No, perfectly legitimate things will be the hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must come to a point that when the call comes, the instant response of our heart will be, "It is the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether or not there will be a reaction to the Lord depends on the attitude of our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We want a perfect detachment from our work or anything that occupies us and from anything that is short of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the call comes, will there be the thought, "But what about the work?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If so, then we may very well stay behind to do it!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may not perish in Sodom, but we may not get up to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A backward glance tells the whole history.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is very easy to get attached to the gifts of the Lord; therefore, Isaac had to be given up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Are we taken up by what we have been given?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Can we say that the Lord has all the place, that we want nothing for ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Lord, You are the One, the only One who can effect such detachment."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When our Lord went to the disciples, Peter heard, "It is the Lord," and all else was forgotten John 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The instant reaction was to go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to Luke 17:33 this detachment can be effected by the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a definite condition for readiness for the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is a necessity to lose our natural man, the part of us which desires, feels, and is always out for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Holy Spirit is here to show us this natural life, because it will come out one day if it is not dealt with now.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It will show itself, and we will have the wrong reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the cross must cut into our life day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the sphere for the work of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is anything in us that is outside of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord must stand alone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He must be all.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In verse 34 one will be taken, that is, alongside the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the Lord speaks of Noah and Lot, He is dealing with the question of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Where do we stand with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our attitude should be "as though they did not possess" 1 Cor 7:30 , "as though" we did not have this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not be ascetics; we are still in the flesh, but we have to be "as though" we are not using them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We possess them, and yet there is a detachment from everything that is not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This can be done only by the inner work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When the call sounds to go in, we will react one way or another, and the way we react will be according to what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Recorded by P.D.</S>
