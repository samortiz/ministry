   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE EIGHT THE LINES, THE PRINCIPLES, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE LAW Scripture Reading: Col 1:15-19; Rom 5:20a; 10:4a; 6:14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to help us understand the book of Psalms and even the entire Bible, we need to see the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible concerning Christ and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit of the Bible does not refer to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, directly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible as an entity has its own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of Psalms, composed of one hundred fifty psalms, is the longest book among the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, each psalm is not just a story, a history, or a kind of teaching, exhortation, or instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each psalm is man's speaking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Psalms we see prayers, thanksgivings, or praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, it is not an ordinary book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Bible readers spontaneously and naturally love this book, but they do not know why it is so lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Psalms are very sweet to us because they are man's talk to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The title of Psalm 18 says that it is a psalm which David "spoke to Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This psalm was not just David's prayer, thanksgiving, or praise, but his speaking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we pray, that is the sweetest time because we are speaking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even in our sweet talk to God, however, we make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may be mistaken, but our talk to God is still very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A husband and a wife may speak to each other in a way that is full of mistakes, but their talk to each other can still be very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for us to understand such a sweet book as the Psalms which is full of both the divine concept and the human concept with human mistakes, we need to see the way to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to understand the Bible, we need to see the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible.</S>
