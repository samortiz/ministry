   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SOUL, AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man is composed of two independent kinds of material: spirit and body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the spirit entered the body of dust, the soul was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible for the spirit to control the body directly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, it requires a medium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This medium is the soul, which was produced when the spirit touched the body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The spirit mingled with the body and brought forth the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As such, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the soul is the result of the union between the spirit and the body; it is the personality of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The body is the outer shell of the soul, and the soul is the outer shell of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before man fell, it was the spirit that controlled his entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the spirit wants to do something, it communicates this to the soul, and the soul motivates the body to obey the command of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the meaning of the soul as the medium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Luke 1:46-47 says, "My soul magnifies present tense the Lord, and my spirit has exulted perfect tense in God my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit must first exult, before the soul can magnify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spirit first communicates the exultation to the soul, then the soul communicates to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The body is the "world-consciousness," the soul is the "self-consciousness," and the spirit is the "God-consciousness."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are five organs in the body, which afford man the five senses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This physical body enables man to communicate with the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why it is called the "world- consciousness."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The soul includes that part known as man's intellect, which helps to make man's existence possible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The part of love generates affections toward other human beings or objects.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The part that can be aroused is the part that originates from the consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these are parts of the man himself; they form the personality of man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, they are called the "self-consciousness."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirit is the part with which man communicates with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With this part, man worships God, serves Him, and understands his relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, it is called the "God-consciousness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit has knowledge, but this knowledge is different from the knowledge of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the spirit is different from the mind, only a spiritual man can know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Corinthians 2:11 says, "For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although man knows things through the mind, his mind is actually not trustworthy and cannot know "the things of man."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mind may have knowledge, but only by man's spirit can he know the things of man and know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, God's Word states the fact: "For who..knows the things of man, except the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This spirit is the part with which man fellowships with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding" Job 32:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly" Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The spirit of man is the part with which man fellowships with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The soul can be stimulated, and it can be disquieted Psa 42:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It can feel sorrowful Matt 26:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In short, the soul is everything that the personality entails.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we can say that the soul is the personality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many portions in the Bible do not call man a man, but a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, when the house of Jacob went down to Egypt, there were seventy people Gen 46:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Bible says, "All the souls...were threescore and six" Gen 46:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The body is like a servant; it is under man's control.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The soul is the meeting point; here the spirit and the body join.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man communicates with the spiritual realm through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He communicates with the world of senses through the body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The soul is in between.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, it communicates with the spiritual realm through the spirit, and on the other hand, it communicates with the physical world through the body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The soul is in between the spirit and the body; it binds the spirit and the body together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The spirit rules over the body through the soul and subjects it under God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The body can induce the spirit to love the world through the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In conclusion, the soul is the source of the personality; man's judgment, intellect, and love all are of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The spirit is the part with which man communicates with the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The body is the part with which man communicates with the physical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The soul is in the middle of these two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It exercises its judgment to determine if the spiritual realm is to rule or if the physical realm is to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes the soul rules through its intellect and stimulations; this becomes the rule of the psychological world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Unless the soul yields its rule to the spirit, the spirit cannot rule.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, the soul has to authorize the spirit to rule before the latter can rule over the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The reason for this is that the soul is the origin of the personality.</S>
