<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Child Delivered Being the New Man</H2><P>This child delivered eventually will be the new man, whose very constituting element is Christ being all the members of the new man and in all the members of the new man (Col. 3:10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Christ Being the New Delivered Child</H2><P>John 16:22 unveils that Christ is both the One who left the disciples in His death and the One who came back to the disciples as the new delivered child in His resurrection, and He will be all the members of the new man and in all of them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Conceiving of the New Man</H2><P>That the new man was created by Christ with Himself as the element on the cross (Eph. 2:15) should be considered the conceiving of the new man by Christ. Ephesians 2:15 reveals that Christ created in Himself, with Himself as the element, the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man. This creation should be considered the conceiving. A child cannot come into being without being conceived. What Christ had conceived was born by the Spirit through His death and resurrection (John 3:5). This is the regeneration by the Father to bring in millions of sons in His species (1 Pet. 1:3). Christ did not have any brothers before His death, but after His resurrection early in the morning He told Mary, "Go to My brothers" (John 20:17). It was on the day of resurrection that Christ began to have brothers because all the believers, His brothers, were regenerated by the Father through His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Main Revelation</H2><P>The main revelation of all these indicates that God's desire and intention was to be united, mingled, and incorporated into one corporate New Jerusalem (Rev. 21). The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the entire sixty-six books of the Bible. All the revelations and visions of the Scriptures consummate in the holy city. The New Jerusalem is the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated into one with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified elect. It is also a couple with the Husband and the bride, the wife. The Husband is the wife, and the wife is the Husband because they coinhere. This is God's eternal economy to incorporate Himself with His elect, to be one universal, divine, mystical incorporation, which is the New Jerusalem.</P>
