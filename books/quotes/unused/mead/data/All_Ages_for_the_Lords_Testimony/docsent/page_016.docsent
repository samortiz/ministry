   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING THE LEAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul speaks of those who take the lead well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is to take the lead as a shepherd leads a flock.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church life there is some need for administration, for example, to make decisions concerning the times and days of the meetings and for other practical arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this, there is the need for elders who do a good job at taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once the elders have taken the lead in a certain matter, perhaps in cleaning the meeting hall, they should step aside and oversee the work of others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is necessary for the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Timothy 5:17 implies that some elders are better at taking the lead and that others are better at teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse says that the elders who rule well should be "counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among the elders, some excel in taking the lead, and others, in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many of us need to take up the burden to be co-shepherds and co-teachers with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the church will bear a strong testimony to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we forget about leadership and concentrate on shepherding, the Lord will honor what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ONLY FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not here for ourselves, but for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not want to corrupt the recovery by acting according to our natural feeling or natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to see the church built up in a pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this, we need the heart to devote our very being to shepherding the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can testify that my heart is solely for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only the recovery can make me happy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But anything that damages the recovery grieves me deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must set a watch against the Devil, the flesh, and the subtle self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we can be damaged at any time, we need to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I expect that you all will remain in the Lord's recovery and that we shall see one another in glory in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to be in the Lord's glory and in His kingdom, we all must take grace and not repeat the damage caused by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because we love Christ and the church, we should take Christ as our practical life and the church life as our practical living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything that damages the recovery we must gladly give up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Lord's recovery we are absolute for Christ and the church.</S>
