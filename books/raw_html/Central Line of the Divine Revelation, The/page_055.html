<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. CHRIST AS THE SEED OF DAVID<br>BEING BEGOTTEN THROUGH HIS RESURRECTION<br>TO BE THE PRINCE (THE KING)<br>THAT WE MAY SHARE HIS KINGSHIP</H2><P>Christ as the seed of David, the king anointed by God, was begotten through His resurrection to be the Prince (the King) in His humanity that we may share His kingship for God's administration (Luke 1:31-32; Acts 13:33-34; 5:30b-31a; 2 Tim. 2:12a; Rev. 20:4, 6). If we read Acts 13:33 and receive light from the Lord, we can see clearly that resurrection was a birth to Christ. He was the unique, only begotten Son of God (John 3:16), but in resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:5-6).</P><P>When Christ as the seed of David became the firstborn Son in resurrection, He became God's sure mercies (Acts 13:33-34; see note 1 on verse 34). He also became the Prince, that is, the King, in His humanity that we may share His kingship for God's administration (Acts 5:30b-31a; see note 2 on verse 31). This is the fulfillment of the second item of the positive intention of God's economy, which is to give man God's dominion that he may represent God in His administration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. OVERCOMING SATAN, SIN, AND DEATH,<br>TERMINATING THE OLD MAN, AND PARTICIPATING<br>IN THE ALL-EMBRACING BLESSING OF THE SPIRIT<br>OF CHRIST AND IN THE KINGSHIP OF CHRIST</H2><P>In order to overcome Satan, sin, and death, to terminate the old man, and to participate in the all-embracing blessing of the Spirit of Christ and in the kingship of Christ, we need at least six items. These items cover all the charges to the believers in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Be Identified with the All-inclusive Christ<br>as the Threefold Seed in His Humanity</H2><P>First, we must be identified with the all-inclusive Christ, as the threefold seed in His humanity, in His death, resurrection, and ascension, so that we can be one with Him, even one spirit with Him (Rom. 6:3-5; Eph. 2:6; 1 Cor. 6:17). It is in this way that we are one with the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Live in Christ's Resurrection<br>through His Cross</H2><P>Second, we must live in Christ's resurrection through His cross (Phil. 3:10). Every day we should walk and live under the shadow of the cross. We should always remain under the cross, not doing anything in a natural way. Then we will have the experience of Christ's resurrection.</P>
