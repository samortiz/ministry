   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SIX PRACTICING THE GROUPS UNDER THE PROPER ARRANGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, do teach us how to pray concerning Your move in the matter of grouping.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need Your guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not want to pray in vain words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We desire to touch Your heart and to touch the crucial items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, do cleanse us again with Your precious blood that we may have a clear conscience with a crystal clear spirit in our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Give us step by step all the things that we need in order to go on in this matter of the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do need Your leading that we may know what we should do in all the churches in Your recovery concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we come to the practical steps, it seems that we do not know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, how should we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This morning we are desperate, looking to You for Your clear leading.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We hide ourselves in You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FORMING THE GROUPS BY PRAYER AND FELLOWSHIP UNDER THE PROPER LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I feel that we should consider taking the way of groups not as something new but merely as an additional part of the work in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our speaking concerning the vital groups, we do not need to use terms such as the old way or the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just as a country forms an army, the Lord s recovery is forming an army.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To form this army, we do not need to stop anything that is presently existing in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can let everything continue just as it is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today to form the vital groups is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are like a country without an army.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we feel the need to strengthen our country.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To build up our country, we need an army.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To form the army, in every church we can gather the volunteers together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we need to look into how to form the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also need to consider who the leaders should be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we need to get into the practical situation step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In forming and practicing the groups, the principles should be the same in every church, but the particular steps do not need to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church in one locality may take a way that is appropriate to their situation, whereas the church in another locality may take a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In principle, however, everything should be initiated by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At first I held the concept that the saints in the churches should form their own groups, but after considering the matter further I feel that that may not be the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I feel that the leading ones in every church should gather the willing ones and give them a word of explanation to cause them to know what we intend to do and how we are going to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then they should pray and fellowship together for some time concerning the formation of the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This should be something besides the normal church activities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we do not do things without prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should pray and fellowship and cause everything to be understood by all the concerned saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we should form the groups with seven or eight members in each group, and we should also select leaders for each group.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not Overstressing the Matter of Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we stress the matter of leadership too much, we will fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should simply tell the leaders that they should fulfill the responsibility of a leader without assuming the position of a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the world people everywhere like to assume the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in the New Testament, although the Lord did appoint the twelve apostles Matt 10:1-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16 , eventually, in Matthew 23:8 He said something that seemingly contradicted His appointment: But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here the Lord seemed to diminish the apostleship and consider all the apostles merely as brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In contrast, at the beginning of nearly all his Epistles, Paul declared that he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one has the capacity, the burden, and the commission from the Lord, there may be the need for him to assume the apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If those who do not have the capacity, the burden, or the commission from the Lord assume the apostleship, the situation will be very disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At Paul s time there was such a disorderly situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because of this, in writing his Epistles Paul had to assert his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Corinthians questioned Paul s apostleship, and the Judaizers claimed to be apostles in order to annul Paul s apostleship 1 Cor 9:1-3 and note 3 on verse 1; 2 Cor 10:12, 18; 11:5, 12-15, 21-23a; 12:11; 13:3, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, there was a need for Paul to vindicate his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the leaders of the groups do not need to assume the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They simply need to take care of their responsibility and fulfill their duty without having the thought and feeling that they are leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To assume the leadership is related to the works of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:6 .</S>
