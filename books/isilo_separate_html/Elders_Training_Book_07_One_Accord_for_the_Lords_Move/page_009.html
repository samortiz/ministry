INTO THE LIGHT AND BEING DEALT WITH BY HIM<br />
TO BECOME A PERSON OF POWER,<br />
FULL OF THE SPIRIT WITHIN AND WITHOUT</h2>
<p>Do not merely ask God to give you the power; the power is waiting for you. You need to be cleansed, dealt with, purified, chastened, and chastised by the Lord. No elder or any brother can deal with or purify your inward being. Only the Lord Himself can deal with you directly. You need to give Him the way in your being every day. Just as we need to wash our hands frequently, we also need to be cleansed by the Lord frequently. To handle the gospel is a most holy thing. This could never be done by anyone whose hands are dirty. We need to come to the Lord and open our entire being to Him to be dealt with, to be enlightened, to be exposed, to be checked, and to be humbled. The power comes from this kind of prayer.</p>
<p>We should not merely pray for the power. The power is there to be appropriated by you, but who are you, what are you, and where are you? You may be dirty, never dealt with, proud, criticizing others, offending your wife, despising the elders, and rebelling against the church. You may be feeble in this way, and yet still be zealous for the gospel. You cannot be a prevailing one to preach the gospel if you are this kind of person. If you are going to be a prevailing one, you need to go to the Lord every day to get yourself adjusted, cleansed, enlightened, exposed, and rebuked, not by man&rsquo;s words but by the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit directly. The Lord has no chance to deal with you unless you pray.</p>
<p>When you pray, do not be occupied with your work or with other things. Do not even be occupied with gospel preaching. You have to keep yourself absolutely free and open to the Lord. Leave yourself open to the Lord. Let Him come in for at least ten minutes to speak to you, to enlighten you, to point out to you all your shortcomings, sinfulness, evil, and impure thoughts. Ask Him to bring your entire being into the light for a full and utter exposure of your real condition. This kind of prayer would make you prevailing. You do not need to pretend that you are powerful. As a purified and chastised person, when you open up your mouth, every word will be a word of power. Whatever comes out of your mouth will be powerful. Even your voice will be powerful because your person will be power. This will be the case because through your prayer you have been saturated by the cleansing One.</p>
<p>The One who cleanses you is also the One who purifies and saturates you. As a person saturated with the Lord, you will be empowered. This is why a word spoken by one person is powerful, and the same word spoken by another means nothing. Prayer makes your person. Prayer makes you another person, a person of power. Such a person of prayer will be full of the Spirit within and without.</p>
<p>When you go to contact others, as a person who is full of power and full of the divine revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the impact will be there. When you go, you must have the unique one accord backing you. You should be one with the church, one with your co-workers, one with all the brothers, and one with all the sisters. You should mean business with the Lord. If you are such a person and if you are not carrying out something on your own and for yourself in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the impact will surely be there.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING SOMETHING HIGH TO PRESENT TO PEOPLE</h2>
<p>I came to the United States when I was nearly sixty with little knowledge of English in speaking. But I believe that since the first day I came to this country I was somewhat empowered, despite the fact that my English may not have been good and my speaking may not have been eloquent. D. L. Moody did not have a high education. He was helping his uncle in a shoe store when the Lord called him to preach the gospel. Once after he preached to a large congregation, a learned person told him that his grammar was wrong. Moody frankly told that person to go to preach with his correct grammar and then see what would come out. The power, the impact, is not in the right grammar. It is in what kind of person you are and what you present to people. People do not want the proper grammar. They want the right thing. They want life. They want Christ. They want the reality of salvation.</p>
<p>The impact with me through the years is in prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Although I am not so skilled in singing, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have composed a number of good hymns. One of them, Hymn 501 in our hymnal, &ldquo;O glorious Christ, Savior mine,&rdquo; is actually much better in Chinese because nearly every line is poetic. Recently, I was in a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in a certain locality, and all the hymns sung in that meeting except for one were written by me. The one that was not written by me was the hymn with the chorus, &ldquo;One with Thee, one with Thee&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> 474). This hymn was written altogether with my ministry by a sister who got much constituted with my ministry. This was another factor to convince me that we need a new hymnal, dropping all the substandard hymns we do not use out of our present hymnal. Fifty years ago Hymn 226, written by the Brethren, &ldquo;We give Thee thanks, O Lord,&rdquo; was a treasure to me. But today this treasure has lost its color and taste. This is a very good hymn, but it is not that rich. It is not as rich as Hymn 132&mdash;&ldquo;Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned.&rdquo; Verse six of this hymn is especially rich:</p>
<p class="hbody">With the Glorified in heaven<br />
 Is the Church identified;<br />
By the Spirit of this Jesus<br />
 Are His members edified.</p>
<p>My point is that when we go out, we need to have something high to present to people. This is why I am not bothered by the opposition. I consider myself as a seller of the oil (Matt. 25:9). If you want to buy the oil, come to me. My English may not be eloquent or grammatical, but the oil and the divine riches are here in this ministry. I am not boasting, but I am challenging you to get into the Word. Take the unique way of prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Do not think of anything else and do not use any gimmicks. Get yourself constituted, qualified, and equipped. Then go out in your prayer with the Spirit presenting the Word. Many will get convinced. The seeking people are eager to listen to someone who can tell them what the reality of human life is. This is what they need, and this is what we have. We need many saints to go and present the divine truths the Lord has shown us to the needy people. Do not think of taking a way other than prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Any other way will cause dissension and division.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
