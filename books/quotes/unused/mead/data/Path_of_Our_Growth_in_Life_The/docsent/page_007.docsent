   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a Christian is saved, the very first thing he needs to do is read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps some brothers and sisters have been reading the Bible in a solid way, but others may not have read the Bible through even once.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we will speak concerning reading the Bible according to various principles, not from a superficial angle but from a very high perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that many people would answer without hesitation that the Bible is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, not too many people have a deep understanding concerning what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even those who have been saved for years may not have a thorough understanding concerning the Bible as the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not have such an understanding of the Bible within us, then we will not be deeply impressed by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE WORD OF GOD BEING GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word of a speaker represents his person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, when someone receives a letter from his father and reads it, he does not have the feeling that it is merely a letter from his father, something that is separate from his father; rather, he has the sense that reading his father's letter is the same as seeing his father in person and that he is right in front of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This may be likened to reading a letter from the person that we love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we read it, we sense that it is not just the words of our loved one, but it is as if we are meeting our loved one in person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, words represent the speaker himself, and the word of God represents God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every time we read the Bible we should have the sense that we are coming not only to the word of God but to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do this, we will be able to read the Bible in a proper way, and the truth we read in the Bible will shine in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we take the Bible merely as a kind of teaching, the Bible will not be very profitable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet every time we read the Bible, if we sense that we are coming to God, this will help us to touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people may ask, "Do you have any scriptural basis for saying that the Word of God is God Himself?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yes, we do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 14 mentions also that "the Word became flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then 6:63b says, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we link these three verses together, they will read: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From these verses we see that the Word of God is God Himself, God expressed, because when the hidden God became flesh, He came as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is expressed as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, if someone came to visit me at home, and I refused to come out of my room, he would not be able to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet if I came out but still remained silent, even though he could see me, he would still not be able to touch my person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not until I open my mouth to speak that my person really comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once I begin to speak, I am "incarnated," and people are able to touch me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may use another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose I am really dissatisfied with Brother Tai.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is my inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then one day Brother Liu comes to look for me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I refuse to open the door, he will not be able to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet when I come out, if he asks me about my impression of Brother Tai, and I remain silent, he will never know what my impression of Brother Tai is until the day that I tell him, "I am really disgusted with Brother Tai."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once I speak this way, my words will represent my very person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the Word of God not only represents God Himself, but the God who is expressed, not the God who hides Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If in our daily life we met one of our friends, but he would not open his mouth to speak to us, this would be troubling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a couple had a good talk one night, and the next morning the wife suddenly became silent, this also would be very troubling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The husband would have no way to know what happened within her until he gets her to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once he does, the more she would speak, the more her being and what was happening within her would come out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible is the word of God, and the word of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Gospel of John does not say that "God became flesh" but that "the Word became flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entire being of Jesus the Nazarene was the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If someone were to ask, "Who is the Lord Jesus?", we would tell him that the Lord Jesus is the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, the Bible says that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Word who was incarnated is the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus, as a whole, is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the One who speaks forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, He said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not adequate to say that the Lord's words are of spirit and of life, because actually the Lord's words are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The entire being of Jesus the Nazarene was the Word of God, the Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God put Himself into His Word, and one day this Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This One was Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this Jesus the Nazarene, there was nothing except the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Word of God is God Himself coming forth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The words that came out of Him are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>John 1 tells us that the Word was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then chapter six tells us that His words are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since the Bible is the word of God, what does the Bible represent?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible represents God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord's words are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus, when we read the Bible, we must realize that to know the Bible is to know the Word of God and that the Word of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God Himself, who is Spirit and the source of life, is represented by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the words of the Bible are spirit and are life.</S>
