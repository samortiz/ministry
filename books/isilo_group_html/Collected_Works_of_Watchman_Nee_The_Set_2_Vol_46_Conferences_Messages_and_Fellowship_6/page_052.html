Because He died, He is Lord of the dead, and because He lives, He is Lord of the living. We are neither lord of the dead nor of the living, so we dare not take it upon ourselves to regulate people's outward actions according to what we believe is right or wrong. Our only responsibility is to seek to bring them into a more intimate relationship with the Lord.</p><p>In verse 10 two things are forbidden among the children of God&mdash;judging and despising. The former is an outward act; the latter is an inward attitude. Sometimes we do not judge, but in our hearts we think, "He is a Christian, but he is not immersed. There must be something wrong with him; I must be better than he." How often we secretly pity those who do not see as we do! But one day all of us are going to be judged, so none of us should judge today. "We will all stand before the judgment seat of God" (v. 10). The judgment seat of God is in the future, so we should not set it up now. Our brother is going to be judged, but we are also going to be judged. If we truly believe in the judgment seat of God, we do not dare to judge others. If we are good judges of others, the Lord will be very severe in His judgment of us. With the measure that we measure out to others, it will be measured to us in return (Luke 6:38). If we can so easily discern right and wrong so as to be able to judge others, then it is only just that we be more severely judged than they.</p><p>Romans 14:12 speaks of our own coming before the judgment seat of God. We will be asked to give an account concerning ourselves, not our brothers.</p><p>Verse 13 says, "Let us judge one another no longer." We should avoid both the "stumbling block" (an open attack) and the "cause of falling" (a secret trap).</p><p>If we only read as far as verse 13, we might conclude that Paul thought that it was all right for believers to be vegetarians. He was persuaded in his own mind, as he had exhorted others to be (v. 5), but he did not force his convictions on them. But in verse 14 he says, "I know and am persuaded...that there is nothing unclean of itself." He makes his own position perfectly clear, but he added, "...except to him who considers something to be unclean; to that man it is unclean." If you think that something is unclean, then it is unclean to you, and if you eat it, you are sinning against your conscience. Paul had keen discernment between right and wrong, but he did not wish to be overbearing, nor did he wish to stress externalities. He continually emphasized the fundamental matter of the believers' relationship with the Lord. In meeting our brothers on any point of difference, we can always say, "To me it is...but I do not wish to impose my convictions on you. I must live to the Lord, and my only desire for you is that you live to the Lord." Many of today's divisions in the church are due to the fact that Christians have disregarded the injunctions of Romans 14:14.</p><p>Many Christians are bold in teaching others by their actions as well as by their arguments. For example, there may be a brother with a very weak conscience which does not allow him to eat meat. In his presence we may eat as much meat as possible, thinking, "I will teach him what Christian liberty is!" We do not argue with him, but we put meat here and meat there in order to demonstrate the nature of Christian liberty to him. Verse 15 does not say, "Do not destroy by your argument." Instead, it says, "Do not destroy by your food," that is, with the actual thing. So if we see differently, we should keep the difference well in the background and not make him conscious of it. We must do nothing whatsoever to hurt him, because Christ died for him.</p><p>In verse 16 Paul admits that our eating of meat is good but warns that we must not let our good be slandered. After all, what is eating and drinking?</p><p>In verse 17 eating and drinking stand for all that is outward, while God's kingdom is inward. We must stress the spiritual, not the technical side of things.</p><p>According to verse 18, we serve the Lord and please men in the matter of righteousness, peace, and joy, not in the matter of eating and drinking. We must discern clearly between right and wrong, but we must never make others the victim of our discernment.</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 15:7</h2><p>This portion of the Word relating to the church life begins with "God has received him" in Romans 14:3 and ends with "Christ also received" us in Romans 15:7. Here we see the basis of all our fellowship with others&mdash;they belong to the Lord and we also belong to the Lord. This is enough. Christians should not have fellowship with each other because, for example, some belong to the Church of England and others also belong to the Church of England, nor because some have had a special experience and others also have had the same experience, nor because some hold certain views and others also hold the same views, nor because some belong to a certain mission and others also belong to the same mission. Christians should fellowship on the basis of belonging to the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 46: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (6) &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
