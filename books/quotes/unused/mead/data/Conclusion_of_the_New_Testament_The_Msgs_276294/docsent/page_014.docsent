   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a Through His Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 6 there are six sections related to Christ as the bread of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>32-71 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first section we have Christ s incarnation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>32-51a ; in the second, Christ s death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>51b-55 ; in the third, Christ s resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>56-59 ; in the fourth, Christ s ascension vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>60-62 ; in the fifth, Christ s becoming the life-giving Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>63-65 ; and in the sixth, Christ s being embodied and realized in the word of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>66-71 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We receive eternal life through Christ s death and resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>51b, 53-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 51b says, The bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have pointed out, this refers to the Lord s dying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was slain, crucified, that we might have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to make Himself available to us to partake of as our food, the Lord Jesus had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus was slain on the cross so that we could eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Resurrection is the next step by which the Lord Jesus made Himself available to us as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although He was slain, He is still living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the living One in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 56 the Lord Jesus speaks of abiding in the one who eats His flesh and drinks His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Christ s resurrection is implied.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse indicates that He had to be resurrected that He might abide in us as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus could not have an abode in us before His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He could abide in us only after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>b To Abide in Him</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Christ has been resurrected, not only does He abide in us, but we may abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He who eats His flesh and drinks His blood abides in Him v. 56 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>c To Live because of Him</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having received Christ as eternal life by believing in Him, we now live because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regarding this, the Lord Jesus said, As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me v. 57 . To eat the Lord is to receive Him into us as food to be assimilated by us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we live by Him whom we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is by this that Christ lives in us as the resurrected One 14:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 6:53-57 the Lord Jesus, the Almighty God and the Creator of the universe, exhorts us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apart from the divine revelation in the Word, we would never have such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If this word had not been spoken by the Lord Jesus, we surely would not have the boldness to say that we must eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But both physically and spiritually we live by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as we need to eat three meals a day in order to live, so we need to eat the Lord so that we can live by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The most important point in the entire chapter of John 6 is that Christ is our food, the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To eat Him is not a once-for-all matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we daily need to contact the Lord and eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because He is the bread of life, He is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we must exercise our spirit to feed on Him, receiving Him, digesting Him, experiencing Him, enjoying Him, and applying Him moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all need to concentrate on this one thing eating Christ and then living by what we have eaten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the divine way of life for our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>d To Live Forever</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 58 the Lord Jesus declared that the one who eats the bread which came down out of heaven shall live forever.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>6 By Him Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the Spirit who gives life v. 63a . At this point the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh 1:14 , became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is as the life-giving Spirit that Christ can be life and the life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We receive the Lord Jesus, but we get the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is as the Spirit that Christ is the redeeming and generating life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today we do not need to contact the Lord physically.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since He is the Spirit, we can contact Him as the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because He is the life-giving Spirit, we can feed upon Him and assimilate Him as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>7 By Him Being Embodied in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ as the bread of life is embodied in the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the Spirit embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In addition to the Spirit, who is wonderful, we need something solid, visible, tangible, and touchable the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Concerning this, the Lord Jesus says that the words which He has spoken to us are spirit and are life v. 63b .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Greek word for words in verse 63 and also in verse 68 is rhema, which denotes the instant and present spoken word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It differs from logos translated Word in 1:1 , which denotes the constant word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In 6:63 the words follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Spirit is living and real, yet He is very mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend; the words, however, are substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First, the Lord Jesus indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit, who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the end of John 6, in verse 68, Simon Peter said to the Lord, Lord, to whom shall we go?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You have words of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This chapter closes with the word of life, which is the means for us to receive the Lord as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we receive the Word, we will have the Spirit; and if we have the Spirit within, we will have Christ as the inner supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May we all realize that our need is Christ as our life supply and then daily contact Him as the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word.</S>
