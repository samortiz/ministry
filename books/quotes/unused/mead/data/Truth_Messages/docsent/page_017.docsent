   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Self-exaltation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A third cause of division is self-exaltation, which usually accompanies ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people, however, are ambitious, but do not seem to exalt themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others are ambitious and are consumed with the desire to have preeminence and to be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such self-exaltation is like a serpent; it causes division among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in order to keep the genuine oneness, we must learn not to exalt ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are an elder or a leading one, you should not boast about this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not claim that you are somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is better to be nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently I heard that a certain Christian group has a slogan that in their fellowship they make everybody somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church, on the contrary, makes everybody nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you want to be somebody, you should not come to the church, for this is not the place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, you should go to that group which claims to make everybody somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Lord s recovery everyone is brought low.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But praise the Lord we are willing to be nobody and to exalt Christ, who has the universal preeminence!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the only Somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We like to be nobodies, because by being nobodies, we are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the past months, I have told the elders at least a few times that I like to be despised, attacked, criticized, and defamed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not want to publish any books with the intention of making myself famous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not even care now to print any more refutals of the false accusations made against us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some have encouraged me to publish a book refuting that slanderous book called The God-Men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when I brought this matter to the Lord, the Lord said, Don t do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let them oppose you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should simply live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The victory is not with outward fame; it is with the crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let others defame you, criticize you, and oppose you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is enough that I am with you and that you live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here in the crucified life, self-exaltation is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah, in God s economy the preeminence belongs to Christ alone!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It pleases the Father to give Him the first place in all things Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I thank the Lord that the vast majority of the saints are willing to be nobodies so that we can have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the past fifty years, we have encountered opposition and rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, most of the saints in the Lord s recovery have been faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only a small percentage have caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But even the trouble caused by them has been a help to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How we thank the Lord for the sanctifying truth that defeats worldliness, ambition, and self-exaltation!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Opinions and Concepts</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fourth factor of division is opinion and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Opinion is like a scorpion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not hold to our own opinion, but simply pursue the Lord s goal: the recovery of Christ as life and as everything for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who have been with me throughout the years can testify that I do not insist on anything except Christ as life and as everything to us for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should all be for this, not for our opinions and concepts regarding other things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The four factors of division worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion can be dealt with only by the sanctifying truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you think that if you contact the Lord every morning, touch the living Word, and have the divine reality infused into your being, you will still be divisive?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we contact the Lord in this way, the factors of division are overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What I am sharing here is not a mere teaching; it is my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the factors of division in us are put to death by the sanctifying truth, we are brought into the genuine oneness, for sanctification keeps us in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only by being in the Triune God do we have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christians today are divided by worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is impossible for worldly Christians, ambitious Christians, self-exalting Christians, or opinionated Christians to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s recovery, on the contrary, is based upon the genuine oneness, which we can have only by being sanctified through the word of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is clearly revealed in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion are dealt with by the sanctifying word of truth, we are kept in the Triune God and we have genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>MAINTAINING THE GENUINE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The fact that the Lord cares for the genuine oneness among His people is seen by the rather negative record in Matthew 18:15-17.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to these verses, if a brother sins, we are to reprove him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if he does not hear us, we should take one or two witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If he still refuses to hear, we should bring the matter to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then if he is not willing to hear the church, he should be regarded as a Gentile and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be considered by the church a Gentile and a tax collector means to be outside the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who are rebellious or disobedient to the church are to be viewed by the church as outside the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is necessary to maintain the genuine oneness among God s people.</S>
