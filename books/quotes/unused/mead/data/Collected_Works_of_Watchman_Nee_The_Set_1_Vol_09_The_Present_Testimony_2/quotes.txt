[1]  CONTENTS THE PRESENT TESTIMONY 2 To My Dear Readers Issue No.
[2]  I have not met with you in this publication for a few months.
[3]  Thank God that He has allowed me to rest in Him and once again take up the responsibility of the work.
[4]  My illness during the last two or three years has surely been used by God to test the compassions of many saints.
[5]  When I hear of the many brothers and sisters scattered in different places who, though they have not met me, yet because of our relationship in the Lord, have wept bitterly before Him for my health, I feel that what you have bestowed upon me is so deep while that which I have given you is so shallow.
[6]  Today, I believe that God wants me to give a message on how to know ourselves.
[7]  A Christian never progresses in spirituality if he does not know himself.
[8]  If we do not know ourselves, we will not only be self-confident and self-approving, but we will also be full of self-content, thinking marvelously of ourselves and being full of a pride that is most displeasing to God.
[9]  Even if we examine ourselves, our experience tells us that we still cannot know ourselves.
[10]  Do we mean to say that we can be careless about our daily life and need not ask whether our walk is right or wrong, or whether our intention is pure or impure?
[11]  Our understanding is that the Bible does not teach us of self-examination, but we have not read that the Bible forbids us from knowing our self.
[12]  Although God does not want us to examine ourselves, He wants us to know ourselves because the coming of the Holy Spirit causes man to reprove himself of his sin.
[13]  A certain believer asked a Jew whether or not he wanted to be saved, and he said no.
[14]  The believer then compelled him to kneel down and pray that God would let him know himself.
[15]  He realized how very filthy he was when the light of God shined.
[16]  Many times we think that we are doing the will of God wholeheartedly and that we are not seeking after anything for ourselves; but, when the light of God shines, we realize that we are not obeying the will of God.
[17]  John 8:12 says, "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[18]  During the time of his suffering, his three friends thought that he had sinned and had offended God.
[19]  We all know that when God revealed Himself to him, the Bible recorded it and said: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; / but now mine eye seeth thee: / wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" Job 42:5-6 .
[20]  When he was locked up in prison, he wrote a letter to one who was very powerful in the Roman church, saying, "Probably you may think that I am powerless now.
[21]  The emperor can easily prohibit the petition of a pitiable monk such as I. However, you have to know that I will surely fulfill the responsibility which the love of Christ has placed upon me.
[22]  But when he saw himself in the light of God, this bravest of all reformers could not help but cry: "I am more afraid of my own heart than of the Pope and all his bishops.
[23]  He was a very spiritual man who was greatly used by the Lord.
[24]  Whenever he preached, countless people wept for their sins, as if pricked in their hearts, and asked forgiveness of the Savior.
[25]  Oh that the things that were seen and heard in this extraordinary person, his holiness, heavenliness, labor, and self-denial in life, his so remarkably devoting himself and his all, in heart and practice, to the glory of God, and the wonderful frame of mind manifested, in so steadfast a manner, under the expectation of death, and the pains and agonies that brought it on, may excite in us all a due sense of the greatness of the work we have to do in the world, the excellency and amiableness of thorough religion in experience and practice, and the blessedness of the end of such.
[26]  We know that we Christians have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ in the future and be judged.
[27]  This judgment does not decide whether or not we shall be saved for eternity.
[28]  No matter what we say, how we feel, what we believe, or what we think, if our walk is not really of the will of God today, then in that day we will surely suffer loss.
[29]  Today if we do not have the light of God to reveal our real condition and to tell us whether or not a matter fits His will, then in that day when God will judge through His light and according to His will, we will surely be unable to stand.
[30]  Therefore, if we want to know whether or not our work can stand in the light of God in that day, then we must ask whether or not our work today is done according to the light of God.
[31]  If we know ourselves through the light of God and walk according to the knowledge of His will through the light of God, then we know ourselves through the light before the judgment seat and walk according to the knowledge of His will through the light before the judgment seat.
[32]  We ought to thank and praise God because we do not have to wait until that day to see the light of God and know how He will judge us.
[33]  If we set ourselves to be faithful, willing to pay any price to obey the will of God, then God will surely tell us His will so that we will know what to do.
[34]  When we pass through this kind of searching and trying by God, we will be able to see if there is any wicked way in us any wicked intentions, so that we may deal with them and be led of God to walk the way of eternal life.
[35]  The purpose of this conference is to unite all the believers in every place who are of the same mind to wait before God and receive the message which will come from Him.
[36]  These four verses can be considered the most important passage in the whole Bible.
[37]  A certain believer once said that the whole Bible is like a ring studded with a precious stone.
[38]  Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" v. 24 . Brothers and sisters, how many of you sitting here want to be free from jealousy and pride, and find that you cannot do it? How many of you do not want to love the world and find that you cannot stop loving the world? How many of you have willed to do good and found that you cannot do good? How many of you have failed once, twice, until you have given up trying to overcome? Is this word of mine merely a law which does nothing but serve as a mirror to expose you? No, here is the gospel.
[39]  Why does the Bible say "the law of sin and of death" instead of "the law of sin" and "the law of death"?
[40]  This is because sin and death are just one law.
[41]  Many times, we do not have the strength to do what we desire to do, and we do not have the strength to not do what we do not want to do.
[42]  Gravity is a law, but if you hold a book with your hand, the power of the hand overcomes the law of gravity.
[43]  It does not mean that the law of gravity is removed; it merely means that another law has overcome it.
[44]  In the same principle, the law of the Spirit of life frees me from the law of sin and of death.
[45]  The law of sin and of death has not been annulled, but another law prevents me from being ensnared by the law of sin and of death.
[46]  This morning God has given me light from this portion of the word and has nourished me.
[47]  For example, there is Jesus Christ, there is Christ Jesus, and there is the Lord Jesus Christ, etc. If we change Jesus Christ to Christ Jesus, we will be wrong doctrinally.
[48]  "This day will the Lord i.e. Jehovah deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel" 1 Sam 17:46 . Here it says that Jehovah would "deliver thee into mine hand," for the purpose that "all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel." Does it say that "God will deliver thee into mine hand...that all the earth will know that there is a Jehovah?" No! The reason is that Jehovah is related to us; He cares for us and delivers the enemy into our hand.
[49]  And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" Exo 3:14-15 .
[50]  God told Moses that He is "I am that I am" i.e., Jehovah , which means the self-existing and the ever-existing One.
[51]  THE PRINCIPLE OF BEING THE SECOND Issue No. 21 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:46-47; Gen 17:18-19; 25:23; Rom 9:12-13; Gen 48:18-19; 1 Sam 8:5; 16:1; 2 Sam 12:14, 24-25
[52]  The message that the Lord gives us this afternoon involves these few portions of the Word.
[53]  These verses show us a principle that God reveals in the Bible.
[54]  In the portions that we have read, we can see that God chooses the second and not the first.
[55]  If all that a man has and is and all that he has acquired and obtained are but things that he has from his birth, he is a hopeless and useless person before God.
[56]  Brothers, our work and life must be delivered from the first.
[57]  For example, it is easy to understand the terms fleshly and spiritual according to the letter, but it is difficult to differentiate between the two in our living.
[58]  How can we tell if our goodness and righteousness come from the first or the second?
[59]  All the cleverness, loveliness, goodness, and talents that we possess from the time of our birth until the time we believe in the Lord are considered to be fleshly by God.
[60]  Anything that God puts in after regeneration and that God adds to us through the Spirit from the time when we believed in the Lord Jesus is of the second.
[61]  Finally, let us remember that anything we can do, will do, or are able to do without much prayer, without a full trust in God, and without the power of the Holy Spirit, is not pleasing to God and will be surely condemned by Him because it is something from the flesh.
[62]  Many readers have long awaited the publication of this twenty-second issue of The Present Testimony.
[63]  After the publication of the twenty-first issue, we were busy preparing for the conference in October, and after the conference we were busy with the Bible study.
[64]  THE PATTERN IN THE MOUNTAIN Issue No. 22 Scripture Reading: Heb 8:5; Psa 19:13
[65]  In spiritual work, the most important thing is to know the "pattern...in the mountain" Heb 8:5 .
[66]  There are many things that are important in spiritual work; the lack of any one of them causes our work to lose its spiritual usefulness and brings about God's displeasure.
[67]  All the things that He wants from us are revealed either through the Bible or through the Holy Spirit.
[68]  Therefore, whatever He has not said is simply work He does not want.
[69]  In spiritual work it is not a matter of quantity, but a matter of measuring up to the standard of being useful to God and matching His desire.
[70]  The most important task for a worker of Christ is to know exactly what God wants him to do and the time and method that he should use to carry it out.
[71]  Brothers and sisters, I have a deep realization that, if God eventually brings you to a deeper stage, you will not only realize that you must not rebel against Him, and that you must refrain from things which He has forbidden, but that you must also stop doing those things which He has neither commanded nor forbidden.
[72]  If we do not judge the flesh and take up the cross to deal with our self, we may reluctantly obey when God gives a command; but, when God gives no command, we will act unavoidably according to our own ideas.
[73]  With respect to God's work, being presumptuous does not necessarily mean that one has a wrong intention.
[74]  Before we are captured by God, our self life does not delight in serving God.
[75]  But after we are captured by God, we desire to serve God.
[76]  In the past we were absolutely not serving God; now we intend to serve God and want to serve according to our own way.
[77]  God demands that we do not merely serve Him, but that we serve Him according to the way of His delight.
[78]  What these two men did was not rebellion and resistance against God.
[79]  They were burning incense to serve God and please God.
[80]  Let us go on to read 2 Samuel 6:1-4 and 6:6b-7.
[81]  "Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
[82]  And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.
[83]  And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah...accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark...Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
[84]  And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God."
[85]  Little do we realize that, just as it was a sin to oppose God with our wisdom when we were unbelievers, it is also a sin to help God in His work with our wisdom after we are saved.
[86]  Paul was an apostle with a very deep spiritual life.
[87]  In his second epistle to the Corinthians he said, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you...but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance" 10:13, 15b .
[88]  Paul said that he would not reach for a place beyond what God had measured to him.
[89]  He recognized that it was his responsibility to go only to the places that God wanted him to be responsible for.
[90]  This issue of The Present Testimony is the first of this year.
[91]  There are many reasons for the delay of the publication of this issue, but we praise God who has made it possible for us to now complete it.
[92]  When we looked at God's provision for The Present Testimony during the last year, we could not help but praise God.
[93]  FOUR CRUCIAL JOURNEYS Issue No. 23 Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 2:1-14
[94]  In this passage of the Scriptures there are four journeys.
[95]  If we want to be like Elijah, who was taken into heaven, or like Elisha, who received the outer clothing of the Holy Spirit that is, the Holy Spirit descending upon him like an outer garment , the crucial lesson is that we must travel on these four journeys.
[96]  This and the following messages on the new covenant were given by Brother Nee in the second Overcomer Conference in October 1931.
[97]  All of us know that the Bible is the Word of God.
[98]  God's Word reveals that grace involves three things: promises, facts, and covenants.
[99]  The word fact is not in the Bible, but in reality, there are many accomplished facts in the Bible.
[100]  A fact can also be called an accomplished work.
[101]  Friends, the redemption of Christ and the coming of the Holy Spirit are not the only facts; even many things that we daily attempt to solve but cannot are facts; Concerning this point, we can look at Ephesians 2:1-10: "And you, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, that He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[102]  When we read the Bible, it is important to determine what are God's promises and what are God's facts.
[103]  Every time we read about God's grace how God has worked for us we have to ask if this is a promise or a fact.
[104]  If it is a promise, we should meet its conditions and pray much until God gives to us the assurance within that the promise is for us.
[105]  We will have the faith to believe that God has heard our prayers, and we will spontaneously praise God.
[106]  If we pray to God, "God, make me resurrect with Christ and ascend with Christ," God will say, "You have already been raised and ascended with Christ."
[107]  Some have asked, "If this is the case, why do we sin again?
[108]  If the old man has already been crucified and if we have the new man, why do we still sin?"
[109]  This morning I spoke about the difference between a promise and a fact.
[110]  This afternoon, I still want to say something more about the difference between a promise and a fact so that you can become clearer.
[111]  A promise is what God says before something is done, and a fact is what God says after something has been done.
[112]  The difference between covenants and grace is the difference between law and grace.
[113]  For example, if refugees came to us asking for relief during a flood, we could do as we pleased.
[114]  God said to him, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward" v. 1 . When Abraham heard it, he said, "Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?" v. 2 . This word shows that Abraham did not yet believe in God's promise.
[115]  When Abraham believed God's first promise, God gave what He promised to him.
[116]  Even though we may not believe, God cannot change what He has promised.
[117]  For this reason, God had to make a covenant with man, so that man would realize that God had to fulfill His word and carry it out so that there would be no unfaithfulness on His part.
[118]  Do you think that at the present time God is dealing with you only according to grace?
[119]  But grace is the flow, while righteousness is the channel.
[120]  God not only deals with man according to grace today; He also deals with man in grace through righteousness.
[121]  A covenant means "a bondage, a loss of freedom and self will."
[122]  When God makes a covenant with us, even if He later regrets making such a covenant, I can reverently say that He cannot touch an established covenant which He has made.
[123]  What an amazing thing that God would want to make a covenant with us and would want His word to be "caught" by us.
[124]  The Lord said clearly to David, that even if his descendants were to forsake His commandments and break His laws, He could not break His covenant.
[125]  The people thought that God had forgotten His covenant with David.
[126]  God promised that David's descendants would continue on the throne, and that his kingdom and house would be forever.
[127]  Matthew 26:28 shows us that although the blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins, the blood is also the "blood of the covenant."
[128]  The reason that the shedding of blood forgives sins is that God had made a covenant with man in which the shedding of the blood would bring about the forgiveness of sins.
[129]  How do we know that a covenant is reliable?
[130]  How can we tell that a testament is reliable?
[131]  We know that many covenants established by many nations are not reliable.
[132]  I deeply believe that if every Christian knew that the blood of the Lord Jesus established a covenant, we would not be as bound, restricted, and powerless, and we would not receive only a few answers to prayer and few results in our work as we do today.
[133]  In the Bible there were two men who covenanted with each other.
[134]  Before the cross, we could not say that God was unrighteous if He did not save us; all we could say was that God did not love us.
[135]  We have received God's grace, but God established His covenant with us according to His righteousness, so that we can reckon with God and lay hold of His Word.
[136]  The way of faith is to speak to God and reckon with Him by taking hold of His Word.
[137]  But we do not receive grace directly; grace does not come to us directly.
[138]  The blood of Jesus Christ has become the foundation of righteousness; the covenant God made with us can no longer fail.
[139]  Mr. Wilkes put it well when he asked, "Will God not do His part when you have done your part?" Therefore, we do not have to worry about our feelings, and we do not have to care about what others say.
[140]  We have seen what a promise is and what a fact is.
[141]  This morning we will see what God's covenant is.
[142]  The only one way for our sins to be forgiven is for us to be cleansed righteously in the Lord's blood.
[143]  However, when sinners want to be saved, they will try any method, whether righteous or not.
[144]  Before we were awakened and before we repented, we refused salvation.
[145]  But when we realized the result of sin, the danger of our present position, and the pain and terror of eternal punishment in hell, we tried many methods to be saved.
[146]  We did not know and we did not care about these things because we were short of the glory of God anyway.
[147]  We need to consider specifically what the new covenant is and what the difference is between the blood and the covenant.
[148]  The new covenant is nothing other than a written document that lists the inheritance purchased by the Lord's blood.
[149]  This document is signed by God Himself, and it acknowledges that all the inheritance purchased by the Lord Jesus is ours.
[150]  The history of God's dealing with man is almost the same as the history of His covenants with man.
[151]  He put Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and all past and present believers into the covenants.
[152]  All the blessings that God gave to Noah, Abraham, David, etc., are all contained in the covenants.
[153]  After Solomon completed the building of the temple, he realized that God had made a covenant with his father David, and he prayed that God would accomplish the words He promised with His own mouth.
[154]  Hebrews 13:20-21 says, "Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever.
[155]  He stands upon the eternal covenant of God and asks God, according to the covenant which He made when He brought up the Lord Jesus from the dead, that the Lord Jesus would live in us, and that we can do the things that are well pleasing to God.
[156]  Unfortunately, no one today prays to God according to the letter of the covenant, and no one asks God to give to him the riches promised in Christ so that he can glorify God.
[157]  THE NEW COVENANT 5 Issue No. 32 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:28; Heb 8:6-12
[158]  We have previously seen that God is a God who makes covenants with man.
[159]  We have also seen that instead of uplifting Himself to an untouchable position, God has lowered Himself to our position, so that we can enjoy the same rights as He has.
[160]  He has allowed us to deal with Him and ask of Him according to the covenant.
[161]  God allows us to demand that He execute everything for us.
[162]  Brothers and sisters, what are the similarities between a covenant and a testament?
[163]  What we have received from the covenant and testament is the same.
[164]  With respect to our relationship with God, it is a covenant; with respect to our relationship with the Lord, it is not a covenant, but a testament.
[165]  He will see the result of His work of shedding the blood: we will know God, no one will have to teach us, and we will have the life and power to obey God.
[166]  The executor of a testament is the one who is responsible for the effectiveness of the testament.
[167]  Every item of the testament is our rightful portion.
[168]  If the executor is faithful, every item of the testament will be ours.
[169]  This morning we saw the items included in the new covenant.
[170]  We have spoken only three things during the past three days: God's promise, His fact, and His covenant.
[171]  This morning we saw that the first item of the new covenant is the forgiveness of sin, cleansing, and anointing.
[172]  The second item we saw was that God's anointing allows man to know God directly and that there is no need for anyone to be taught by his neighbors, brothers and sisters, or parents.
[173]  We can fellowship with God and speak to God according to the covenant, and there is no need for anyone else to teach us or instruct us.
[174]  The third item we saw was that the indwelling Holy Spirit enables us to do what is pleasing to God.
[175]  For now, we only need to know how our sins and unrighteousness are forgiven before God, and how they are absolved and forgotten.
[176]  Brothers and sisters, we have to know the difference and the distinction between the sins before God and the sin within us.
[177]  Let me illustrate: Romans 1 through 5:20 is about our sins before God.
[178]  The reason that they are not merely forgiven is because our sins are also judged before they are forgiven.
[179]  Our sins are not forgiven without being first judged by God.
[180]  God is not ignorant of our sins and does not gloss over them; He does not skip over the judgment of our sins.
[181]  The first fulfillment of the new covenant is being cleansed of our sins by God.
[182]  The forgiveness of our sins by God is something that belongs to the covenant; it is not apart from the covenant.
[183]  Today we have seen that God covenanted with us to forgive and not remember our sins.
[184]  You can say to God, "God, you have made a covenant with me.
[185]  If we do not worship God in this way, we do not have a way to worship Him, because we truly do not have the assurance that we are saved and have eternal life.
[186]  We have read this passage in Hebrews 8 over and over.
[187]  If we study this portion carefully, we will see that it contains three promises: 1 The law will be imparted into the mind and inscribed on the heart, to the effect that God will become God to us, and we will become God's people.
[188]  2 The result of the law within our heart is that we will know God.
[189]  We will not only know God's will and God's commandment, but know God.
[190]  God is propitious to our sins and forgives our unrighteousness, then He puts the law into us and inscribes it upon our hearts, with the result being that we know God.
[191]  Let us read 8:8-9, "For finding fault with them He says, Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.'"
[192]  Today Christians everywhere are very ignorant of this gospel.
[193]  However, the gospel of the forgiveness of sins can be found everywhere.
[194]  Everyone knows about the death of the Lord and the blood He shed to save us and forgive us of our sins.
[195]  It is amazing that we know that we are saved by the Word of God and not by ourselves, but in the matter of overcoming, we think that we have to strive, struggle, and wrestle.
[196]  Not only do we have a new spirit which enables us to fellowship with God, but we have a new heart which enables us to love God and everything spiritual.
[197]  In Kuling, Kiukiang, there was a brother who was an electrician.
[198]  Originally he was a nominal Christian who was not even clear about his salvation.
[199]  We have to know God's will item by item.
[200]  One English brother with deep experience in the Lord and who knows God well once said that we not only can know God's will, but also His heart.
[201]  God has not only given us the Bible for us to keep, but He has given us the law within us so that we can know His heart.
