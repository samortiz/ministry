<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS AND<br />
ENDURING SUFFERINGS AND DIFFICULTIES</h2>
<p>Although we are continually bearing the cross, we bear only one cross, not many crosses. This unique cross was accomplished by the Lord and is applied by us to become our cross. Contrary to what is commonly believed, this cross does not refer to many sufferings and difficulties. Many Christians consider sufferings and difficulties as &ldquo;crosses&rdquo; to be accepted and borne. In their understanding, to endure sufferings and difficulties is to bear the cross. Such an understanding is inaccurate. Although sufferings and difficulties can help us accept the cross, they are not &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; God uses sufferings and difficulties to help us experience the cross, but He does not want us to consider sufferings and difficulties as &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; Sufferings and difficulties are simply tools used by God to help us accept and experience the cross.</p>
<p>The cross is the Lord&rsquo;s death. When we bear the cross, we are applying the Lord&rsquo;s death to ourselves, putting ourselves under this death. When we do not apply or are unwilling to apply the Lord&rsquo;s death to ourselves, our sufferings and difficulties force us to experience the Lord&rsquo;s death. After we have accepted the Lord&rsquo;s death, His cross and our outward sufferings and difficulties often work together so that we experience the Lord&rsquo;s death. Thus, sufferings and difficulties are not the Lord&rsquo;s death or the cross. No matter how great they may be, these blows, adversities, sorrows, and losses are not &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; The Bible never says that sufferings and difficulties are &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; This inaccurate and unscriptural view is a natural concept; it has no scriptural basis. I hope that we will no longer see the cross in such a way.</p>

BEING CONFORMED TO THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH</h2>
<p>Bearing the cross means that we accept the Lord&rsquo;s death by faith and thus apply His death to ourselves. When we bear the cross in such a way, we put ourselves into the Lord&rsquo;s death and live in His death. This is to be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death (Phil. 3:10). To be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death is to live in His death. Being conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death is the same as bearing the cross. Bearing the cross is to live in the Lord&rsquo;s death and to follow the Lord in the way of the cross. Just as the Lord remained under the death of the cross, denied Himself, and lived by God, we also need to remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death, deny ourselves, and live by God. Just as the Lord chose the cross and lived under the death of the cross to establish the form of His death, we should bear the cross and live in the death of the cross to be conformed to the form of His death. To bear the cross is to be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>

BEARING ABOUT IN THE BODY THE DEATH OF JESUS</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus.&rdquo; The phrase <em>putting to death</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;killing.&rdquo; In other words, in our bodies the death of the Lord Jesus is always doing a killing work, killing everything in us that does not match God or that hinders, frustrates, nullifies, or prevents the life of God from operating in us. This is also bearing the cross, putting ourselves into the form of the Lord&rsquo;s death, allowing the Lord&rsquo;s death to put us to death. If we truly put ourselves into the form of the Lord&rsquo;s death and allow His death to put us to death, there will always be an operation of death in our bodies. In other words, if we truly bear the cross, we will bear about in our bodies the putting to death of Jesus, which is the killing of the cross. Hence, bearing the cross is to bear the death of the Lord Jesus in the body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS AND<br />
BEING PUT TO DEATH BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit (Rom. 8:13), because we have seen, believed, and accepted the fact that we died with Christ. We apply our co-crucifixion to the flesh by the Spirit so that He can do the putting-to-death work in us. We bear the cross because we have seen, believed, and accepted the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion, and we apply the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion to ourselves by the Spirit so that the Spirit can put us to death. In principle, bearing the cross and applying the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion are the same. However, the putting to death by the Spirit is related to the practices of the body and of our sinning members, that is, the flesh and our sinful deeds; bearing the cross, however, is related to dealing with our soul-life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EMPHASIS OF BEARING THE CROSS<br />
BEING TO DEAL WITH THE SOUL-LIFE</h2>
<p>The Epistles do not refer directly to bearing the cross. However, every time that the Lord Jesus spoke concerning bearing the cross, He also spoke concerning our soul-life. Bearing the cross is related to the soul-life, because bearing the cross deals with the soul-life (Matt. 10:37-39; 16:23-25; Mark 8:34-35; Luke 9:23-24; 14:26-27; John 12:24-26). The Lord&rsquo;s intention in asking us to bear the cross is that we would deal with our soul-life, putting our soul-life under the death of the cross and allowing the cross to put our soul-life to death.</p>
<p>The soul-life is our natural life and is the biggest hindrance to our spiritual growth in the divine life. In other words, our soul-life hinders the growth of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life in us, which is our inner man, and it also keeps us from following the Lord and obeying the will of God. Therefore, if we want our spiritual life to grow and if we want to freely follow the Lord and obey the will of God, we must bear the cross by allowing the cross to put our soul-life to death.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke of bearing the cross and of dealing with the soul-life, not merely because it is crucial to deal with the soul-life but because every aspect of the soul-life needs to be dealt with. In Matthew 10:37-39 and in Luke 14:26 the Lord said that the natural emotion of the soul-life needs to be dealt with. Matthew 16:22-24 shows that the natural opinions and views of the soul-life need to be dealt with. Luke 17:31-33 and John 12:24-26 speak of not preserving or loving our soul-life so that we can follow the Lord and live for God and to God by the life of the Lord.</p>
