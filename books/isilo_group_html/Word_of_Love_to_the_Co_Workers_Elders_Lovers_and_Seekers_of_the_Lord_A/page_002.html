Everything is quite encouraging. The one thing we all have to admit, though, is that we are short of fruit-bearing. This is not only our problem. This has been a problem to all Christians throughout the past two thousand years. If each regenerated believer would bear one fruit yearly, within less than twenty years, the entire world would be saved. However, after almost two thousand years of church history, today&rsquo;s situation related to fruit-bearing is far short of what it should be. Since the end of World War II, the Muslim religion, not Christianity, has been the religion with the most increase. This is a shame to us Christians.</p><h2 class="head1">FRUIT-BEARING BEING TO GAIN PEOPLE ONE BY ONE</h2><p>Fruit-bearing is a big problem. I studied this matter for a long time even before 1984, when I went to Taiwan to study our situation and consider how we should go on. I found out, in principle, that fruit-bearing is not something of a mass movement. It does not take place by great campaigns. Fruit-bearing takes place according to two principles. The first principle is seen in God&rsquo;s creation of man. God created only one man, Adam. Man&rsquo;s multiplication, man&rsquo;s fruit-bearing, is not by mass production but by individual persons bearing children to have a family. At the most, in principle, a family can bear one child a year, twins being an exception. After about six thousand years, the whole earth has been replenished with man. The second principle of fruit-bearing is seen in John 15. Christ is the vine tree and we are His branches to bear fruit. As branches of Christ, according to John 15, our unique responsibility is to bear fruit. Fruit-bearing is by the branches individually. Each branch bears its fruit. This shows us that to have a movement to gain fruit by mass production is wrong. The evangelists in Christianity have big gospel campaigns to convert many people, but where are those people today? Even we have the concept to have big gospel meetings. We may bring several thousand people together to hear the gospel, and take many names, but how many of them do we really gain practically? Our churches remain relatively the same in number year after year. The increase is too slow. I read something which said that a Christian group with an honest pastor who faithfully teaches the Bible and preaches the gospel will gain a yearly increase of ten percent. Do we have this ten percent increase? This shows us that there is a problem with our fruit-bearing.</p><p>The problem, I believe, is not with our spiritual life but with our way. Recently, we have seen that John 4:14 reveals the flowing God. God is flowing. In order for a river to flow, there must be a proper way. This is why we must study our way. When I went to Taiwan in 1984, I thought that we should endeavor to baptize many people. In this point we gained a success, but eventually this did not work so well. We had a big gathering in Taipei to gain people through door-knocking. One day we tried to gain three thousand, and we succeeded. Although we gained so many, not many of them are remaining fruit in the church today. We may say that whether they remain in the church or not, they are still saved persons, but this is not practical. Eventually, I found out that the proper fruit-bearing is by individual believers. This is why I started to speak in the United States concerning the vital groups. The vital groups are for fruit-bearing. They are for gaining people one by one.</p><p>This earth on which we live is like a great sea full of fish. Since thousands of fish are passing around us day by day, how can we say that we cannot catch one of them within one year? Is it possible for someone to fish for a year and not catch one fish? Yet for many years this has been the situation among us. Because I have shared concerning the vital groups, we still at least keep the name <i>vital groups.</i> Some call themselves &ldquo;vital groups,&rdquo; but are they vital? Some have had &ldquo;vital group&rdquo; meetings for three years, but instead of increasing, they have decreased. Because of this, some have reported to me, saying that door-knocking does not work. This is not true. Two great heretical groups in the United States, the Mormons and the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, depend almost entirely upon door-knocking. They have nearly no other way for their increase. They only use the one way of door-knocking. According to their statistics of around 1990, the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses in Japan say that they need to knock on six thousand doors to gain one person. However, some of us have only been going out for three weeks or three months without gaining one person and then say that door-knocking does not work. I do not even believe that the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses or Mormons have the best way of door-knocking. According to my study, we have a much better way. I have not spoken enough on the vital groups due to the shortage of time. From this time I will speak on the vital groups for a whole term of the full-time training. Through this speaking we will be able to see that the Lord has shown us a much better way to gain people through door-knocking than that of the Mormons and Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Word of Love to the Co-Workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
