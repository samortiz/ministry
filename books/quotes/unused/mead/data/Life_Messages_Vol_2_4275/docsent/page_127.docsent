   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR THE TESTIMONY OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31a, 37a; Zech 4:2, 6, 10b; 3:9; Rev 1:12b, 20b; 4:5; 5:6 GOD BECOMING OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is a precious yet mysterious book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only does it reveal God to us; it also speaks thoroughly about the relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In its pages we are told that God created man and that man must worship, love, and fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God, we are also told, became our Savior by delivering us from our sins and from perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most mysteriously, the Bible also reveals that this Creator and Redeemer is Spirit, and as such wants to come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This last point is the hardest for us to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, we know that He is to be worshipped and obeyed as the Creator and to be believed in as our Savior and Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But to comprehend that He wants to enter into us to be our life and even our person is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do have a life of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life, however, is really only a picture of the true life, just as a photograph resembles us but does not have our life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The real life is God Himself entering into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God created man in His image Gen 1:26-27 for the very purpose of entering into him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man is God's vessel Rom 9:21-23 ; God wants to be man's content.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as a glove is empty and meaningless, unless a hand becomes its content, so human life is also empty, unless man has God in him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we receive the Lord, He becomes our content and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the life in us, and we are His living without.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He lives within us, and for us "to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This relationship we have with Him is hard to express in words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus in the Bible there are many types, or pictures, to convey the meaning of what would otherwise be abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The golden lampstand in Exodus 25:31-37 is one of these types.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE LAMPSTAND AS A TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible the golden lampstand has three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first is the one in Exodus, the lampstand in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second is in Zechariah 4:2-10 , where God considers His people Israel as a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The last is in Revelation 1:12, 20 , where the church is symbolized as a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's people, whether the true Israelites or the true believers, should be a golden lampstand.</S>
