To Mingle God with Man<br>That God and Man May Be One</H2><P>The purpose of the incarnation is also to mingle God with man that God and man may be one. We are not one with God merely by being in company with Him. This is why it is more meaningful to say that we and God are one. Instead of always saying that we are one with God, we should learn to say that we and God are one. But even to say that we and God are one is still not fully adequate. We have to say that we and God are one by being mingled together.</P><P>Because of the wrong teaching of Eutyches in the fifth century, most Christian teachers dare not to say that God and man are mingled together. The Eutychians denied the distinctness and coexistence of Christ's divinity and humanity, and they asserted that the two natures were merged into one, resulting in a third nature being produced (see Concerning the Person of Christ, pp. 10-11, published by Living Stream Ministry). But this teaching is in contradiction with the revelation of the Holy Word. We need to see the wonderful truth in the Bible concerning the mingling of divinity with humanity. According to Leviticus 2:4, the fine flour mingled with oil as the meal offering is a type of Christ as the One who was a mingling of divinity with humanity. Although oil and flour are mingled into one, they are still two in nature; they are not merged into one to become a third nature.</P><P>The Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine and we are the branches (John 15:5). We were born of God to be the branches of Christ. We have been grafted into Christ (Rom. 11:24). Grafting is a matter of mingling. When the branches of one tree are grafted into another tree, the two become one not just by joining but by mingling. The two plants are mingled to become one plant. In other words, the two lives are mingled to become one life.</P><P>The meal offering in Leviticus 2:4 is made of fine flour mingled with oil. Two elements are mingled together to be one entity, but without a third element being produced. The English word mingled means that two elements are combined together but that they remain distinguishable in their elements. The meal offering is of two elements, the element of oil and the element of fine flour. No third element is produced. The truth of mingling can also be seen in 1 Corinthians 6:17, which says that "he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." This indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. The divine Spirit dwells in our human spirit, and these two mingle together as one spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
