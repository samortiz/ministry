   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Meaning of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just as death includes several aspects in regard to its meaning, there are several aspects of resurrection in regard to its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Resurrection of Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first item included in death is the death of the spirit, and the first item included in resurrection is the resurrection of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An understanding of this aspect of resurrection involves a distinction between fact and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Raised us up together with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God raised Christ from the dead, He raised us up together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a fact related to the resurrection of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our spirit was resurrected based on our union with Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition to Ephesians 2:6, several other verses speak of the fact of our union with Christ in resurrection, including Colossians 2:12 and 3:1, Romans 6:4-5 and 8, and John 14:19.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ Eph 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse speaks of the experience of our spirit being resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This experience is based on the fact that we were raised up together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Prior to believing, our spirit was deadened, and it had lost its function before God because of our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, when we believed in Christ and received Him, God enlivened our deadened spirit based on the fact that we were raised up together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit s function toward God was revived at the time of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Colossians 2:13, John 5:25, and Luke 15:24 and 32 also speak of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Resurrection of Our Body</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second item included in the meaning of death is the death of the body; the second item included in the meaning of resurrection is the resurrection of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a believer is saved and regenerated, his spirit is resurrected, but the body of a believer will not be resurrected until later.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All in the tombs...will come forth...to the resurrection John 5:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The resurrection spoken of in this verse is related to the body, not the spirit, because it speaks of all in the tombs coming forth to the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Resurrection out of the tombs is the resurrection of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How are the dead raised?...What you sow is not made alive unless it dies...So also is the resurrection of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption 1 Cor 15:35-36, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses speak of the resurrection of a believer s body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many think that resurrection is vague and implausible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ten years ago I met a college student.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said that he believed in Christ but could not believe in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I pointed out the window to the wheat fields and said to him, Look at these lush fields of wheat!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How do they grow out of the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do they not come out in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The grains of wheat fall into the ground and die, then something grows out of the ground in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The possibility of our resurrection seems to be quite vague, but the principle of resurrection can be seen in all living things, both plants and animals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An egg breaks, and a baby chicken is born.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A seed decays, and a flower sprouts up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are pictures of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are too many examples like this in the field of biology!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the college student heard this word, he realized that resurrection was quite logical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He admired my examples and explanation, but I did not think of them myself; they come from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible says that if what we sow does not die, it cannot be made alive, but if it dies, it can be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, the body of resurrection is superior to the body that is planted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The resurrection of a dead believer follows this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who die will live again; they will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, what is planted in death is a corruptible, shameful, weak, fleshly body, but what comes out in resurrection is an incorruptible, glorious, strong, spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, this reference to resurrection in the future emphasizes the resurrection of the body, which is practical and real.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Order of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All will be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ s at His coming; then the end 1 Cor 15:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In God s plan and arrangement the resurrection of the dead has an order.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each one is resurrected in his turn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was the first to resurrect from the dead, so He is the firstfruits of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Next, the saints who belong to Christ and who have died will resurrect when the Lord returns before the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Finally, at the end of the millennial kingdom the unsaved who have died will resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Generally speaking, resurrection can be divided into three groups, but there are some exceptional occurrences of resurrection, such as the resurrection of the two witnesses Rev 11:3-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>An hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment John 5:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All those in tombs, whether they are believers or unbelievers, will hear the voice of the Son of God and be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, the time and nature of their resurrection will differ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first to be resurrected will be the saints who have done good; they will come forth to the resurrection of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who are raised first will obtain life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The second will be the unsaved who have practiced evil; they will come forth later to the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those who are raised later will receive judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The resurrected saints will receive life, so their resurrection is called the resurrection of life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will occur before the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The resurrected unbelievers will receive judgment, so their resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This will occur after the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These two resurrections are different in nature and in time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One is to life, and the other is to judgment; one is before the millennial kingdom, and the other is after.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They will be one thousand years apart.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The preceding two points concerning the order of resurrection are a general outline.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now let us analyze them more closely.</S>
