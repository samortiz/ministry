   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRESENT SPREADING OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Initiated in the Far East and Growing There</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord s recovery among us was initiated through Brother Nee approximately seventy years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Also, the Russian revolution to bring in Communism began approximately seventy years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The czarist rule in Russia was replaced by Communism under Lenin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Around the same time, the first local church in China was established in Brother Nee s hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today Communism has been proven a failure, but the recovery of the practical church life is still prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord initiated His recovery among us in the Far East, and it is still growing there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brought to and Rooted in</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>the United States for Growth</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the early 1960s, the recovery was brought to the Western world and into the English language.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It has been brought to and rooted in the United States for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through the English language in the past twenty-nine years, the Lord s recovery has spread to every inhabited continent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The entire world is open to the Lord s recovery today in the matter of the divine truth in the Bible because people are hungry for the divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still in the Stage of Initiation in Europe</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recently, a group of brothers traveled to Eastern Europe and Russia, and they have testified of the openness and immense hunger of the people there for the divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They visited one city in eastern Germany where they found a meeting of a group of about six hundred Russians who had migrated there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These Russians spoke to the brothers about six books that are being published in Russian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two are by Brother Nee The Normal Christian Life and The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Four are by me The Experience of Life, The Knowledge of Life, The Economy of God, and God s New Testament Economy .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They told the brothers that they could distribute one million copies of each of the six books in a quick way if they were available.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows the hunger of the people there for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this point I would like to ask one of the brothers who traveled to Eastern Europe to give a testimony of what he saw there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>__________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Testimony : I had the privilege of spending ten days both in Switzerland and Germany, especially in the eastern part of Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since the Second World War, eastern Germany has basically been closed off to Western influence of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We felt that it was really a preserved area.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The communist system got rid of everything that was not real in the way of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anyone who had anything in them for God really paid a price to maintain that and to meet with Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our goal in going was especially to see the situation in the universities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We spent three days on three campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These campuses were in Leipzig and Berlin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We found that, especially in the eastern area of Berlin that has been basically untouched by Western influence, the young people were preserved and were very open to anything that we said.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of them had never seen an American.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During these three days, we spent our time going to the college cafeterias to meet the students.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The students would sit with us, and we would speak the truth of the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not a small thing to be a university student there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the time that these students are young, they are raised up knowing that they are going to the university, and this is all that they have in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The young people in the universities are of the highest caliber.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are very serious, and they see a bright future ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are eager to hear everything from the West.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first group of students to whom I talked happened to be English majors.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although we could communicate by using The Mystery of Human Life a gospel booklet in German, they followed more closely by using the English which they had learned in school.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I began to show them how man was made in three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For the first time their eyes were beholding the diagram of the three circles illustrating the tripartite man, and they saw how they were created with a human spirit to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I shared with them the diagram of the processed Triune God entering into the tripartite man, and they were completely focused on this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At one point, one girl said, You have to tell us more about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We don t know anything about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This describes the kind of atmosphere that was there with many of the ones to whom we spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A number in Leipzig prayed with us right there in the cafeteria.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We plan on continuing the contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Leipzig was a special situation because there was very little Western influence there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We asked the students about some from the West coming there to study.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They told us that they hardly ever heard of such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even some of the administrators wondered why anyone would want to come there to study.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the recent year, the university we visited in Leipzig lost many students who immediately took the opportunity to study in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Again, I want to say that we felt this was a very preserved situation for the Lord s move there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we were in Berlin, we saw that there was more of a Western influence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Among the ones we contacted, we saw more religion and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But overall we felt that the basic need was for laborers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If some would be there speaking the truth as we did in the short time we were there, the Lord could really gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Several of the ones we spoke with said that they were raised as atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They did not know anything about God, and they had never had a Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To them all of the Bible truths are brand new.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While we were there, we only contacted one person who was involved in any Christian activity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One of the students we spoke to was carrying a simple gospel tract which he had obtained, but nobody had ever led him to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A seed had been planted in him, but it had never been reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The brothers asked him to pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was open, and he prayed with them to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There was very little trace of Christian activity in the places we visited.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One thing that we really saw was the spiritual and material void left by communism.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because everything had belonged to the state, there was no motivation in the people to maintain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is an atmosphere in which there is not much to live for physically, and there is a void inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The students we spoke to desired to know the truth and they wanted to know about God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through our contact with those in Leipzig, about eight received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Berlin the brothers contacted a Russian-speaking woman who was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She was our first fruit from eastern Berlin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She prayed with the brothers to receive the Lord, and then she invited them to her home that night for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They baptized her that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This was a real confirmation of the openness there.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>__________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The above testimony is a confirmation of the open door in Europe for the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have also received word that many of the people in Eastern Europe and Russia will only accept the writings of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They said that if we sent them millions of copies of our writings, they would distribute them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is a famine of truth in that part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some of the people there have even begged the brothers to send people to teach them the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In both the Far East and the United States, the Lord s recovery is growing, but it is still in the stage of initiation in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should remember that the United States, Europe, and the Far East are the three influential factors of the present situation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The recovery has taken root in the United States and the Far East, but there is a void in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>For this reason, the Lord s direction of His present recovery must be toward Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The recovery in Europe is still in the stage of initiation.</S>
