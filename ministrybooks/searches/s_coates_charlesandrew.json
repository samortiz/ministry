In his Synopsis J. N. Darby has only a short word on the ointment and the incense. In his notes on the Pentateuch, C. H. Mackintosh says that in the holy anointing oil \u201cwe discern a type of the varied graces of the Holy Ghost, which were found, in all their divine fullness, in Christ.\u201d But he does not tell us what these graces are. The writing of C. A. Coates on Exodus 30 shows a great improvement. With respect to the ointment, he uses the term the Spirit of Christ many times. Few writers use this expression; most speak of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, or even the Holy Ghost. Furthermore, Coates speaks of \u201cthe Spirit of the Man of God\u2019s pleasure\u201d and also of \u201cthe Spirit of another Man\u2014even of the Man who is at God\u2019s right hand.\u201d This indicates that Coates saw that the Spirit of Christ is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of another Man. Concerning the four spices, Coates says that they \u201crepresent all those features of grace which were so perfectly blended and harmonized in the Spirit of Christ.\u201d Coates realized something concerning the blending of the spices with the olive oil. Four kinds of spices were compounded with the olive oil to make the ointment. "}, {"book_ref": "Life-study of Exodus, msg. 159: The Holy Anointing Oil  (3) ", "page_num": "1700", "snippet": " C. A. Coates has much to say concerning the Spirit in his writing on Exodus 30. He devotes nearly three pages to the ointment and the incense. In this section of his writing he uses the terms the Spirit of Christ or the Spirit twenty-one times. He does not speak of the Spirit as the Holy Spirit or as the Spirit of God. Once he speaks of the Spirit of the Man of God\u2019s pleasure. He indicates that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the Man of God\u2019s pleasure. Coates also speaks of the Spirit of another Man, even the Man sitting on the right hand of God.

However, he does not say what are the features of grace that are blended in the Spirit of Christ. Regarding this, he did not have light. He did not see that myrrh signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ and that cinnamon signifies the effectiveness of Christ\u2019s death. Furthermore, he did not see that calamus, rising up out of a muddy situation and [1701] shooting into the air, is a symbol of Christ\u2019s resurrection, and that cassia, a substance that repels insects and snakes, typifies the power of Christ\u2019s resurrection.

A. Coates. Someone once gave one of his books to the Queen of England. The Queen read the book and was helped by it. However, Coates had written eight books. When I was in England, I asked the British brothers, \u201cSince Coates has eight books, why would he not give the other seven books to the Queen?\u201d The brothers did not say anything. They acted as if I had said something wrong. Later, I asked some other people and learned that a common English person could not give a book to the Queen.

Eventually, after the tabernacle was built up and the priests were made ready, there was not only the olive oil, but the compound ointment. This indicates that we have not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ. No doubt, Mr. C. A. Coates has seen something here.

The life-study of Revelation that I gave in the summer of 1976 was based on Brother Watchman Nee\u2019s study of Revelation, and his study was based on that of Robert Govett, C. A. Coates, and others, who no doubt picked up matters from foregoing teachers. Thus, our study was an accumulation [70] of the proper interpretations of Revelation, the book of mystery. Today we can add a further crystallization-study to the hidden manna. The manna was first hidden in a pot made of gold. Revelation speaks of the golden lampstands in 1:12 and the golden mountain as the base of the New Jerusalem in 21:18b. The Lord also advised the church in Laodicea to buy gold refined by fire (3:18). Gold signifies the Father as the source of the Triune God. God the Father is the basic element of the golden lampstands and the golden mountain upon which the New Jerusalem is built. Therefore, Christ as the hidden manna is hidden first in the divinity of God the Father, the first of the Triune God.

It would appear that His features are figurative while the comparisons are symbolical. For example, the \u2018head\u2019 would be figurative of intelligence, but if it is said to be \u2018like Carmel\u2019 a comparison is instituted which is of a symbolical nature and indicates the character of the intelligence. Another example may be given from another part of Scripture. We read, \u2018And his feet like fine brass, as burning in a furnace\u2019 (Rev. 1:15). His \u2018feet\u2019 are figurative of His movements, but when we are told that they are \u2018like fine brass, as burning in a furnace\u2019 this is symbolical language. It is of the nature of a figure that it is comparatively easily understood; a child would understand that the feet represent how one moves. But a symbol requires more mature consideration: the language of symbols has to be learned from their use in Scripture, and by divine teaching. Any simple person would know that a door or gate indicated the way into something, and might mean access or exclusion according as it was open or shut. This is the language of figure. But if we read that the doors of the temple were of olive-wood, carved with cherubim and palm-trees and half-open flowers, and overlaid with gold, this is the language of symbol, into which we have to be initiated before we can understand it. So if we read that Jerusalem\u2019s gates are of carbuncles, and that the twelve gates of the heavenly city are twelve pearls, these are symbolical statements. There is no natural resemblance between a gate and a pearl: such a description has to be understood symbolically. There may, or there may not, be some kind of natural correspondence between a figure and the symbols which are used in connection with it. Very often there is none; but whether there is or not the symbols have their own significance. This applies to the interpretation of all Scripture symbols; a symbol in every case adds something to the figure which in itself it would not have. It will be helpful to bear this in mind as we look at the comparisons and similitudes which we shall meet with in Song of Songs\u201d\u2014C. A.

First, there are the Brethren teachings. John Nelson Darby with his Synopsis of the Bible, C. H. Mackintosh, Coates, and their writings have been notable among them. Another line is the inner-life line from the mystics, such as Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, Brother Lawrence, and so forth. The third line is the biographies and autobiographies of all the spiritual giants of church history. We received the help of many American spiritual giants, such as Charles Finney, D. L. Moody, R. A. Torrey, and Paul Rader. Torrey succeeded Moody, and Rader succeeded Torrey alongside James Gray. Gray was the president of Moody Bible Institute. He put out some small books to help the saints know the Bible. When I was young, I read some of his books. Then there was Charles G. Trumbull, who wrote The Life That Wins. There was also A. B. Simpson. He might be the most spiritual person whom the United States has produced. Then there was Dr. C. I. Scofield. In 1925 Dr. Scofield\u2019s Bible correspondence course was translated into Chinese, and Brother Nee helped very much in that translation. He advocated and promoted that Bible course. I got a set and studied it. "}]}
