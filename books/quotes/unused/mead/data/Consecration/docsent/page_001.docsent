   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have been born again, there is still much work for God to do in our lives, and there is also much service that we can render to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this calls for a complete surrender of our lives to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to allow Him to do His work in us; we need to allow Him to use us; and we need to allow Him to lead us over the stretch of road that lies ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All this demands an utter consecration of our lives to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It amounts to giving our consent to His working in us, to His using us, and to His directing of our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In dealing with inanimate objects, God does not require their surrender; but in dealing with living men and women, He needs to gain our consent before He can work in us, or use us, or direct our paths.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to fill a bottle with medicine, the procedure is perfectly straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We simply take up a bottle and pour in the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we who are parents know that when we want to give medicine to a child, it is quite troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to exhort, entreat, and even offer some reward to the child.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If that fails, we have to call the older brother or sister, and put the child on the bed, because everyone must help to hold down the child while a little medicine is poured in.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But, brothers and sisters, God does not deal with us as we parents deal with our children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not want Him to do His work in us, He waits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is extremely patient.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We parents may use compulsion with our children, but God waits for our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our consecration is our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the case of very many Christians, a long time elapses after their new birth before you see any evidence of their really having advanced in the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After a period of perhaps ten years, you still find them more or less where they were before clearly born again, possibly having acquired a certain amount of doctrinal knowledge, perhaps even actively engaged in a certain amount of church work, but as far as true spiritual values are concerned, no further on than they were at the time of their new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The explanation is that there has been no handing over of their life to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There has been no time in their history when they have had a thoroughgoing transaction with God and have definitely said to Him: I want to be in Your hands for You to work in me and through me and for You to lead me in Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone who wishes to serve God must have such a transaction with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only in the measure in which we allow Him to work in us shall we be able truly to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only to the extent to which we have been laid hold of by Him can we be used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Consecration is a favorite theme with many preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Scarcely anywhere is there a series of devotional meetings without the subject of consecration being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In many instances, however, the emphasis is on man offering himself to God for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The consecration of which we are speaking here has no such emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you have such a concept, we trust you will set it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1 THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When anything of consequence is undertaken by God or man, the basis of such an undertaking needs to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now this matter of consecration is one of supreme importance; therefore, it must rest on a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God requires that we surrender ourselves to Him, on what does He base His requirement?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He must have ground for requiring our surrender, and we in turn must have ground for surrendering ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible shows that the question of consecration is settled on the ground of purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ye are not your own, says the Word in one place, For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body 1 Cor 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And elsewhere it says: Whether we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord s Rom 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible speaks also of our being God s bondslaves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A bondslave is one over whom his master has full rights because of his having bought him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The term bondslave does not sound particularly pleasant, but we who have experienced the grace of the Lord know the sweetness of being His bondslaves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord has purchased us with a great price so that now no one of us has a right to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The authority over our lives was given into His hands by right of purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is on this basis that He claims our surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At great cost, even at the cost of the precious blood of His Son, God has bought us for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By virtue of His having bought us, the authority over our lives is neither the world s nor our own; it is His.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has, therefore, clear ground to require that we hand ourselves over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And from our side, since we were bought by Him, if we do not hand ourselves over to Him, we are acting like runaway slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are like Onesimus, whom Paul sent back to his master Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many Christians, right up to the present day, are runaway slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord has established His rights over them by redemption, yet they refuse to recognize His legal claims.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has paid the price, but they will not let Him take possession of what is His own.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This amounts to an offense against the law of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must settle this matter of God s legal claim upon us by handing ourselves over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The sound basis of consecration is a legal one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our consecration is not based on the constraints of love, as many Christians think.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They offer themselves to or withhold themselves from the Lord according as they sense His love or fail to sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But in the sight of God, our consecration is not an optional matter; its legal basis is established.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have been bought as His bondslave, and whether you like it or not, you belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The right to your life is not yours, but His, for He has acquired it by purchase.</S>
