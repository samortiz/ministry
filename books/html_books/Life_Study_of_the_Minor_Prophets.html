<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Micah 5:2a; Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15; Micah 4:7b; Hosea 3:5</h1>
<p>With this message we begin the Life-study of the Minor Prophets (except Zechariah, which we have covered in a separate series of messages). The burden of these messages on the Minor Prophets can be expressed in the following four statements:</p>
<p>1) From Bethlehem will come forth the Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from the days of eternity (Micah 5:2).</p>
<p>2) The Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights (implying resurrection) for the salvation of God to all the sinners (Jonah 1:17; 2:10; Matt. 12:40-41).</p>
<p>3) Christ is the Desire of all nations and will come as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings (Hag. 2:7; Mal. 4:2).</p>
<p>4) Christ will dwell in the holy mountain of Zion, to be a shelter and a stronghold to Israel, and rule among them from Jerusalem (Joel 3:16-17; Micah 4:7).</p>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; &ldquo;The days of eternity&rdquo; refers to Christ&rsquo;s eternity. Christ is the eternal One, but in His incarnation He became a man in time by being born in the small town of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Matthew 12:40 and 41 say, &ldquo;Just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here.&rdquo; As typified by Jonah, Christ, the Son of Man, was in the heart of the earth three days and three nights (implying resurrection) for the salvation of God to all the sinners. At the time of Jonah, God&rsquo;s redemption and salvation spread from Jerusalem to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. It was a surprise to the Jewish prophet Jonah that God would care for the Gentiles and send him to Nineveh, an evil city built by Nimrod (Gen. 10:9-11). The significance of the type of Jonah is that Christ died, was buried, and was resurrected to spread God&rsquo;s redemption and salvation to the far away Gentiles.</p>
<p>Haggai 2:7a says, &ldquo;I will shake all the nations, and the Desire of all the nations will come.&rdquo; Malachi 4:2a declares, &ldquo;Unto you who fear My name will the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings.&rdquo; Today all the nations are full of darkness and unrighteousness. On earth there is darkness upon darkness, and there is unrighteousness upon unrighteousness. Who can deal with this situation? No one can. Our only hope, our only expectation, is that Christ is coming as the Sun to shine and to swallow the darkness and also as righteousness to be the righteousness to the nations. He will come with healing in His wings to heal the nations from darkness and unrighteousness. We are waiting for Him as the Desire of the nations and as the Sun of righteousness.</p>
<p>Joel 3:16 and 17 and Micah 4:7 speak of the millennium, the time of restoration. Joel 3:16b and 17a say, &ldquo;Jehovah will be a shelter to His people / And a stronghold to the children of Israel. / Thus you will know that I am Jehovah your God, / Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain.&rdquo; Micah 4:7b says, &ldquo;Jehovah will reign over them in Mount Zion / From then on, and even forever.&rdquo; These verses reveal that in the millennium Christ will dwell in the holy mountain of Zion to be a shelter and a stronghold to Israel and will rule among them from Jerusalem. In the time of the restoration Christ will not remain in the heavens but will come physically to the earth, to the Jewish land, to the city of Jerusalem, to Mount Zion, to dwell there and to be a shelter and a stronghold to Israel. This is Christ&rsquo;s future.</p>
 <p>In these verses we see many things concerning Christ: His eternity, His incarnation in time, His death, burial, and resurrection for the spreading of God&rsquo;s redemption and salvation to all the nations on earth, His coming as the Desire of nations and as the Sun of righteousness, and His being the One dwelling on Mount Zion to be a shelter and a stronghold to God&rsquo;s elect. As He rules among them, Christ will rule the whole earth from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In this introductory word, let us now go on to consider the composition, the contents, and the central thought of the Minor Prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE COMPOSITION</h2>
<p>The Minor Prophets are composed of twelve books, from Hosea to Malachi. In ancient times these books might have been considered one book. &ldquo;The book of the prophets&rdquo; mentioned by Stephen in Acts 7:42, in his quoting of Amos 5:25-27, might refer to this collective book. Although these books are minor, they complete the divine revelation concerning God&rsquo;s economy in His dealings with His elect&mdash;Israel&mdash;and the nations, which is covered in detail in the books of the Major Prophets&mdash;Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. All the books of both the Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets were called by the Lord Jesus &ldquo;the Prophets,&rdquo; in which things concerning Him were written (Luke 24:44). This indicates that the central point of all the prophets is not chastisement or judgment but Christ. When we come to the books of the prophets, we should care mainly for Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CONTENTS</h2>
<p>The contents of the Minor Prophets include God&rsquo;s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy, and a number of crucial points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Economy<br />
in His Loving Chastisement of Israel</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, in His governmental dealing with Israel, and in His judgment upon the nations issues in the manifestation of Christ as the centrality and universality in God&rsquo;s economy to bring in the restoration. According to Psalm 2, Christ, God&rsquo;s King, is the Lord, the Possessor, of the earth. The entire world is under Christ as the &ldquo;General Manager.&rdquo; He is not only the Lord but also the Manager, managing the entire world situation. At present this is somewhat hidden, but one day He will be manifested. God&rsquo;s economy on this earth will eventually issue in the manifestation of Christ. When this manifestation takes place, all people will see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy to bring in the age of restoration. This is the first aspect of the contents of the Minor Prophets, an emphasis which is also found in the Major Prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ as the Centrality<br />
and Universality of God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>In the Minor Prophets Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy is emphatically unveiled. In the Minor Prophets (not counting Zechariah, which reveals other aspects of Christ) this unveiling, this revelation concerning Christ, has sixteen points. We will now briefly consider these points according to the sequence of the facts.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. In His Eternal Origin</h2>
<p>We have pointed out that Micah 5:2c says that Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; This refers to Christ&rsquo;s eternal origin.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In His Human Birth in Bethlehem</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2a says that from Bethlehem would come forth the One who would be the Ruler in Israel. This is the only verse in the entire Old Testament which tells us that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. In His First Coming as the Messenger of God</h2>
<p>Malachi 3:1-3 reveals that in His first coming Christ came as the Messenger of God. As God&rsquo;s Messenger, He brought people God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s message. This word, this message, is actually Christ Himself. We may say that He is the letter sent by God to us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. In His Union with Israel as the Son of God<br />
Loved by God and Called Out of Egypt by God</h2>
<p>Hosea 11:1 says, &ldquo;When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.&rdquo; This speaks of Christ in His union with Israel as the Son of God loved by God and called out of Egypt by God. The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Matthew 2. Not long after Christ was born, while He was still in His babyhood, Herod tried to kill Him. But according to the word of an angel, Joseph took Jesus and His mother and departed into Egypt and remained there &ldquo;until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, &lsquo;Out of Egypt I called My Son&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. In His Death and Resurrection<br />
for the Salvation of God to Sinners</h2>
<p>A further aspect of Christ is typified by the prophet Jonah. Jonah was swallowed by a great fish and was vomited out of it for the spreading of God&rsquo;s salvation to the Gentile Ninevites (Jonah 1:17; 2:10). This is a type of Christ in His death and resurrection for the salvation of God to sinners, even to the Gentiles (Matt. 12:39-41).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. In His Being the Desire of All the Nations</h2>
<p>In Haggai 2:7 we see that Christ is the Desire of all the nations. Even though the nations do not know Christ, they still desire to have Christ. All the nations desire to have peace and a good life, but the situation in the world is the opposite of this. Christ is peace; Christ is also the good life. For the nations to desire these things means that they actually desire Christ. He is the Desire of all the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. In Elijah&rsquo;s Being Sent before Him<br />
to Prepare the Way for His Coming Back</h2>
<p>Elijah will be sent before Christ to prepare the way for His coming back (Mal. 4:5-6; 3:1a; Rev. 11:3-4).</p><h2 class="head3">8. In His Being Sent by God<br />
the Second Time with His Overcomers</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There cause Your mighty ones to descend, / O Jehovah!&rdquo; (Joel 3:11b). This reveals that Christ will be sent by God the second time with His overcomers. Today Christ is making overcomers, those who will be with Him in His coming back. When Christ comes back, He will come with His overcomers to fight against Antichrist.</p>
<p>In the universe there are two sources: God and Satan. God is embodied in Christ, and Satan will eventually be embodied in Antichrist. Both Christ and Antichrist will have an army. In His coming back Christ will descend with His army, composed of the mighty ones, the overcomers. This indicates that at the time of His coming back, Christ and His army will defeat Antichrist and his army.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. In His Arising as the Sun of Righteousness<br />
with Healing in His Wings</h2>
<p>As we have seen, according to Malachi 4:2 Christ will arise as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. In His Going Forth as the Dawn<br />
and Coming as the Rain,<br />
as the Latter Rain Which Waters the Earth</h2>
<p>Hosea 6:3b says, &ldquo;His going forth is as sure as the dawn, / And He will come to us as the rain, / As the latter rain which waters the earth.&rdquo; In 10:12 we are told that Christ will come and rain righteousness upon us. Christ&rsquo;s going forth has not stopped. He is still going forth as the dawn. Also He will come as the rain, even as the latter rain. How much Christ is to us! He is the dawn, the rain, and the latter rain.</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. In His Second Coming as the Angel<br />
of the Covenant, Whom Israel Desires</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Angel of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, He will come, says Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (Mal. 3:1b). This speaks of Christ in His second coming as the Angel of the covenant, whom Israel desires. The covenant of which He is the Angel is the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head3">12. In His Coming as the Mighty One<br />
with His Overcomers<br />
to Defeat Antichrist and His Army</h2>
<p>In Joel 3:11 Christ is unveiled in His coming as the mighty One with His overcomers to defeat Antichrist and his army.</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. In His Judgment of the Nations</h2>
<p>Christ is also unveiled in His judgment of the nations&mdash;the judgment of the living (Joel 3:2a, 12, 14; Matt. 25:31-46; Acts 10:42; 17:31).</p>
<h2 class="head3">14. In His Dwelling in the Holy Mountain of Zion<br />
within Jerusalem to Reign among Israel</h2>
<p>Joel 3 unveils Christ in His dwelling in the holy mountain of Zion within Jerusalem to reign among Israel to be their God, their shelter, and their stronghold (vv. 16-17, 21b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">15. In His Reigning in Zion as David Their King,<br />
as Ruler in Israel, in the Millennium</h2>
<p>David was a type of Christ as the King. In the Minor Prophets Christ is unveiled in His reigning in Zion as Israel&rsquo;s King, the Ruler in Israel, in the millennium (Micah 4:7b; 5:2b; Hosea 3:5a; Zeph. 3:15b; Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">16. In His Shepherding of Israel,<br />
Becoming Great and Being Their Peace</h2>
<p>Finally, Christ is unveiled in His shepherding of Israel, becoming great and being their peace (Micah 5:4-5). In the millennium Christ will be not only the King and the Ruler but also the Shepherd.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Some Crucial Points</h2>
<p>Let us now go on to consider come crucial points in the Minor Prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Prepared to Meet Our God</h2>
<p>Amos 4:12 says, &ldquo;Prepare to meet your God, O Israel.&rdquo; There is no other verse in the Bible which tells us to prepare to meet God. Are you prepared to meet your God?</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. God Pardoning Our Iniquity<br />
and Passing Over Our Transgression</h2>
<p>These books speak in different ways concerning God&rsquo;s forgiveness. According to Micah 7:18 and 19, God pardons our iniquity and passes over our transgression, treading our iniquities underfoot and casting all our sins into the depths of the sea. This reveals how willing God is to forgive our iniquities.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Outpouring of the Spirit<br />
on the Day of Pentecost</h2>
<p>Another crucial point, prophesied in Joel, is the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (2:28-32a; Acts 2:16-21). This outpouring was a great matter, for it initiated the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Righteous One Living by His Faith</h2>
<p>The matter of the righteous one, or the just one, living by his faith was not initiated by Paul but was prophesied in the Minor Prophets. &ldquo;The righteous one will live by his faith&rdquo; (Hab. 2:4). This word was quoted by Paul in Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, and Hebrews 10:38. To live by faith implies having life by faith. Thus, the righteous one has life and lives by his faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. God Being Light to Us<br />
and Bringing Us into the Light</h2>
<p>God is light (1 John 1:5). The Lord Jesus said that He is the light of the world (John 8:12). But even in the Minor Prophets it is prophesied that God would be light to us, His people, and would bring us into the light (Micah 7:8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</h2>
<p>The central thought of the Minor Prophets involves many things, beginning with God&rsquo;s judgment. God will judge the world (Joel 3:2a). Sinners should prepare to meet God (Amos 4:12). Christ as the eternally divine One came to the earth and was born to be human (Micah 5:2). He entered into death and resurrected from it for the extending of God&rsquo;s salvation to all the nations (Jonah 1:17; 2:10; 3:2). Sinners who repent and believe in Him will be forgiven of their sins and justified by God to have the divine life that they may walk in the divine light and become the mighty ones of Christ, sent with Him by God in His second appearing (Amos 4:12; Micah 7:18-19; Hab. 2:4; Micah 7:8-9; Joel 3:11b). He will arise as the Sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2) and come as the Angel of the covenant (Mal. 3:1b) to reign in Zion (Micah 4:7b) and shepherd Israel (Micah 5:4). Then the millennium of the restoration will be brought in (Micah 4:1-3; Hosea 14:4-8; Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 19:28). When we put all these points together, we have the central thought of the Minor Prophets.</p>
<p>The Minor Prophets are minor, but the revelation they bring in is major. The central point of the divine revelation in the Minor Prophets is the same as that in the Major Prophets.</p>
<p>The crucial emphasis of the revelation released by all the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi is that God wants to have an organic union with His chosen people, like the union of Adam with Eve. In the writings of the prophets, God expresses His desire to have an organic union with His chosen people, making Himself their life and making them His expression. In this way God and His chosen people become a couple, a compound person, just as Adam and Eve became a couple. Originally Adam was alone, but later Eve came out of Adam. Eve was built from Adam&rsquo;s rib to match Adam, to marry Adam, and to be Adam&rsquo;s counterpart (Gen. 2:21-22). Eventually, the two became one in nature and in life. This is a type of what God desires. God&rsquo;s desire is to be united with His chosen people to be a universal couple, which in Revelation 22:17 is called &ldquo;the Spirit and the bride.&rdquo; Because this is God&rsquo;s intention in His eternal economy, both the Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets speak of God as the Husband and of God&rsquo;s chosen people as the wife. This thought is fully developed in the New Testament, but it was unveiled first through the prophets. It is very important that we see this in our study of the Major and Minor Prophets.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention, God&rsquo;s desire, makes Christ the centrality and universality in God&rsquo;s economy. In the New Testament Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). Christ is everyone and in everyone. Eventually, the whole church is nothing but Christ.</p>
<p>We have seen that part of the contents of the Minor Prophets is that God&rsquo;s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, that is, in His governmental dealing with Israel, and in His judgment of the nations issues in the manifestation of Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy to bring in the restoration. God&rsquo;s instrument to chastise Israel has been, and still is, the nations.</p>
<p>World history is displaying the fulfillment of what was prophesied through the prophets. After their prophecies, given seven or eight centuries before Christ, God came in to chastise Israel by sending Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, to destroy Jerusalem. Since that time, Israel has not been recovered. Israel has been under Babylon, Medo-Persia, the Macedonian-Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire, which continues to influence the entire world. For twenty-six centuries Israel has been suffering under a long, divine chastisement. Today God is using the Arab nations to chastise Israel.</p>
<p>This chastisement has been for the purpose that Christ would be manifested as everything, as the centrality and universality in God&rsquo;s economy. This manifestation will bring in the age of restoration. Thus, God is moving, working, and managing the world affairs to fulfill His eternal economy, that is, to make Christ everything to mankind for the bringing in of the kingdom, the age of restoration.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HOSEA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INTRODUCTORY WORD<br />
AND<br />
THE SYMBOL OF A WIFE OF HARLOTRIES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 1:1&mdash;2:1</h1>
<p>In this message we will first give an introductory word and then begin to consider the symbol of a wife of harlotries.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Hosea</h2>
<p>In Hebrew Hosea, the original name of Joshua, means &ldquo;salvation (of Jehovah),&rdquo; denoting that Jehovah is the salvation (Num. 13:8, 16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Hosea&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Hosea&rsquo;s ministry was 785-725 B.C., a period of sixty years.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of Hosea&rsquo;s ministry was the adulterous and apostate kingdom of Israel. Adulterous refers to Israel&rsquo;s condition, and <em>apostate</em> refers to Israel&rsquo;s position. As to their condition they were adulterous; as to their position they were apostate. That was the situation of Israel as God&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of Hosea&rsquo;s ministry was the northern kingdom of Israel. By the time of Hosea&rsquo;s ministry, Israel had been divided into two kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the book of Hosea is Jehovah as the salvation to the adulterous and apostate Israel in receiving her back and restoring her. This book reveals that in spite of Israel&rsquo;s adulterous condition and apostate position, Jehovah is willing to be salvation to her. Eventually, He will receive her back and restore her.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of this book is that regardless of how adulterous Israel is as the wife to Jehovah and how apostate Israel is as the people to Him, He still desires that she would return to Him. If she would return to Him, He would still receive her, bring her back, and restore her.</p>
<p>Israel was given up by God at the time of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and also later when Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. The children of Israel became desolate and homeless, wanderers among the nations. Although they have been somewhat established in the land of Palestine, God still has not received them back or restored them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>The book of Hosea reveals Christ in His first coming and in His second coming.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. In His First Coming</h2>
<p>In His first coming Christ would be in union with Israel as the Son of God fleeing to Egypt and being called out of Egypt (11:1; cf. Matt. 2:13-15). This indicates that although Israel became exceedingly evil, Christ still became organically one with them through incarnation to be a real Israelite. Christ is the Son of God, and the Israelites were sons of God. Christ joined Himself to them in this matter of being sons of God. In His humanity He was a genuine Israelite.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In His Second Coming</h2>
<p>In His second coming Christ will go forth as the dawn and come to Israel as the rain, as the latter rain which waters the earth (Hosea 6:3b; 10:12). At that time the people of Israel will be the earth watered by Christ as the rain.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Hosea has three sections: a wife of harlotries (chs. 1&mdash;3); a people of apostasy (chs. 4&mdash;13); and the restoration of Israel (ch. 14).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SYMBOL OF A WIFE OF HARLOTRIES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Prophet Hosea<br />
Taking Gomer, a Wife of Harlotries</h2>
<p>The prophet Hosea took Gomer, a wife of harlotries (1:2-9). This symbolized that God took Israel as His wife&mdash;one who gave herself to harlotries and who departed from Jehovah. God told Hosea to do what He Himself had done, and Hosea did as God had commanded him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Gomer Bearing Hosea a Son<br />
Named by God Jezreel</h2>
<p>Gomer bore Hosea a son named by God Jezreel (vv. 3b-5), symbolizing that God will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel (2 Kings 10:1-11) upon the house of Jehu and will bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel (2 Kings 15:10-12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Gomer Bearing Hosea<br />
a Daughter Named by God Lo-ruhamah</h2>
<p>Gomer also bore Hosea a daughter named by God Lo-ruhamah (Hosea 1:6-7). This name, which means &ldquo;she has not obtained compassion,&rdquo; symbolizes that God will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that He should forgive them at all. However, on the house of Judah Jehovah will have compassion and will save them by Jehovah their God, not by bow, by sword, by battle, by horses, or by horsemen.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Gomer Bearing a Son Named by God Lo-ammi</h2>
<p>After weaning Lo-ruhamah, Gomer bore a son named by God Lo-ammi (vv. 8-9). This name, which means &ldquo;not My people,&rdquo; symbolizes that Israel is not God&rsquo;s people and God will not belong to her.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Promise of Restoration</h2>
<p>Hosea 1:10&mdash;2:1 is God&rsquo;s promise of restoration to the children of Israel. This promise is a matter of grace. Grace follows sin. Where sin abounds grace abounds even more (Rom. 5:20).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Number of the Children of Israel<br />
Being Like the Sand of the Sea</h2>
<p>In the restoration the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered (Hosea 1:10a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Being Called Sons of the Living God</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In the place where it will be said to them, You are not My people, / It will be said to them, You are the sons of the living God&rdquo; (v. 10b). Sons of God indicates regeneration. When God makes a new covenant with Israel (Jer. 31:31-34), they will have God written into their hearts. This means that they will be regenerated. God will put Himself into them as their life to make them the sons of God. Thus, Israel will be not merely the people of God but also the sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Children of Judah<br />
and the Children of Israel Being Gathered Together<br />
and Appointing for Themselves One Head</h2>
<p>In the restoration the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint for themselves one head, and they will go up from the land of their captivity, for great will be the day of Jezreel (meaning &ldquo;God sows&rdquo; or &ldquo;God will sow&rdquo;), the day for the people of Israel to be sown in the holy land by God (Hosea 1:11; 2:22-23). Today God has sown the children of Israel back in their fathers&rsquo; land, and no one can pluck them out again.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. God Charging Them to Say to Their Brothers,<br />
&ldquo;Ammi,&rdquo; and to Their Sisters, &ldquo;Ruhamah&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Eventually, the Lord will charge the children of Israel to say to their brothers, &ldquo;Ammi&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;My people&rdquo;), and to their sisters, &ldquo;Ruhamah&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;she has obtained compassion&rdquo;). Thus, Israel will be perfected. Under the victory of God&rsquo;s love, Israel will become His people and obtain His compassion.</p>
<p>We all need to learn a twofold lesson from Hosea 1. First, God loves Israel with an everlasting love. There will be no change in His love. Second, although God is loving, He is also a God of purity and righteousness. He cannot tolerate any kind of uncleanness or unrighteousness. Wherever these things are found among God&rsquo;s people, God&rsquo;s chastisement comes in. For this reason, even though Israel has been re-formed as a nation, they are still under God&rsquo;s chastisement. Nevertheless, as they are being chastised by God, they are still loved by Him. It is the Lord&rsquo;s lovingkindness that they have not been consumed (Lam. 3:22). Because of His compassion, Israel remains.</p>
<p>We too have been chosen by God and loved by Him with an everlasting love. However, we should not indulge ourselves just because God is loving. We must be in fear and trembling as we enjoy His love. If we are even a little mistaken, God will come in to chastise us. Yet His everlasting love is always victorious. On the one hand, His dealing with us is a matter of His chastisement; on the other hand, it is a matter of His love. His love will gain the victory.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HOSEA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SYMBOL OF A WIFE OF HARLOTRIES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 2:2&mdash;3:5</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the symbol of a wife of harlotries.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Harlotries of Gomer<br />
as the Wife to the Prophet Hosea</h2>
<p>The harlotries of Gomer as the wife to the prophet Hosea symbolize the adulteries of Israel as the unchaste wife to Jehovah (2:2-13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Wanting the Returned Israelites<br />
to Contend with the Adulterous People of Israel</h2>
<p>Verse 2a says, &ldquo;Contend with your mother; contend.&rdquo; This indicates that Jehovah wanted the returned Israelites (the daughters) to contend with the adulterous people of Israel (the mother).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Denying That Israel Is the Wife<br />
and That He Is Her Husband</h2>
<p>In verse 2b Jehovah says, &ldquo;She is not my wife, / And I am not her husband.&rdquo; This implies a kind of divorce. The situation forced God to do something abnormal. However, God&rsquo;s divorcing Israel was based upon His strong determination to receive her back again. In a sense, God divorced Israel, but He did this with the intention of receiving her back again. What God does concerning Israel is based upon what He is.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah Warning Israel</h2>
<p>In verses 2c through 4 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s warning to Israel. First He charged her to turn away her harlotries from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts (v. 2c). If she failed to do this, He would strip her naked as in the day she was born and make her a wilderness and a dry land and slay her with thirst (v. 3). Moreover, on her children He would not have compassion, for they were the children of harlotries (v. 4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Israel Having Gone About as a Harlot<br />
and Acting Shamefully</h2>
<p>Verse 5a tells us that Israel has gone about as a harlot and acted shamefully. She even went so far as to say, &ldquo;I will go after my lovers, / Who gave me my bread and my water, / My wool and my flax, / My oil and my drink&rdquo; (v. 5b). She said that her daily necessities were supplied by her lovers, that is, by her idols. That, of course, was a lie.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Jehovah Hedging Up Her Way with Thorns<br />
and Building Up a Wall against Her</h2>
<p>In verse 6 Jehovah says, &ldquo;Therefore I will now hedge up / Her way with thorns; / And I will build up a wall against her, / So that she will not find her paths.&rdquo; Quite often the great God would do many small things in order to frustrate us for the purpose of dealing with us. As Paul says in Romans 8:28, all things, great and small, work together for our good. As we will see, this was the situation with the prophet Jonah. The great fish, the castor oil tree, and the worm were all used by God to deal with Jonah.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Israel Pursuing Her Lovers<br />
but Not Overtaking Them</h2>
<p>Hosea 2:7a goes on to say, &ldquo;She will pursue her lovers / But will not overtake them; / And she will seek them but not find them.&rdquo; This shows Israel&rsquo;s stubbornness. Even though God will hedge her up and build up a wall against her, blocking her way, she will not return to Him but instead will pursue her lovers, her idols. However, eventually she will say, &ldquo;I will go / And return to my first husband, / For it was better for me then than now.&rdquo; This indicates that eventually she will return to God as her first Husband. All of us have had this kind of experience. First, we struggled persistently against God to a point, but later we returned to God to be with Him. We said, &ldquo;I will return to God, for it was better then than now.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Israel Not Knowing That It Was Jehovah<br />
Who Gave Her the Grain,<br />
the New Wine, and the Fresh Oil</h2>
<p>Israel did not know that it was Jehovah who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil and who multiplied to her silver and gold. Rather, she used the silver and gold to serve Baal, an idol (v. 8).</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Jehovah Taking Back His Grain in Its Time<br />
and His New Wine in Its Appointed Season</h2>
<p>Verse 9 tells us that Jehovah will take back His grain in its time and His new wine in its appointed season, and He will snatch away His wool and His flax, which were to cover her nakedness. Some may wonder whether the great God would do things such as this. Yes, God does such things in order to correct us, to adjust us, to perfect us, and to make us according to His intention.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. Jehovah Uncovering Her Lewdness<br />
in the Sight of Her Lovers,<br />
and No One Delivering Her from His Hand</h2>
<p>Jehovah will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one will deliver her from His hand. He will bring all her mirth to an end, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her appointed assemblies. He will desolate her vine and her fig tree, of which she said, &ldquo;These are my payments / That my lovers have given me&rdquo; (vv. 10-12a). He will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field will devour them (v. 12b). He will also visit the days of the Baals upon her, in which she offered incense to them and adorned herself with her nose rings and her jewels and went after her lovers and forgot Jehovah (v. 13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah&rsquo;s Restoration<br />
of the Adulterous and Apostate Israel</h2>
<p>In 2:14-23 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s restoration of the adulterous and apostate Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Luring Israel,<br />
Bringing Her into the Wilderness,<br />
and Speaking to Her Heart</h2>
<p>Jehovah will lure Israel, He will bring her into the wilderness, and He will speak to her heart (v. 14). The wilderness should signify a wild place. During the Second World War Hitler made Germany a wilderness for the Jews, and today the Arab countries are trying to make the nation of Israel a wilderness. God would allow even this, for in the wilderness God can speak to Israel.</p>
<p>Quite often in our human life we enter into a situation which may be likened to a wilderness. Sometimes God will cause our environment to be a wilderness so that He may speak to us, to our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Giving Israel Her Vineyards<br />
and the Valley of Achor as a Door of Hope</h2>
<p>Jehovah will give Israel her vineyards from there (the wilderness) and the valley of Achor as a door of hope. She will respond there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt (v. 15).</p><h2 class="head3">3. In That Day Israel Calling Jehovah<br />
Her Husband</h2>
<p>In that day Israel will call Jehovah her Husband (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:14; Ezek. 16:8) and will no longer call Him Baali (meaning &ldquo;my Master&rdquo;&mdash;Hosea 2:16). For Jehovah will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they will no longer be remembered by their name (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Jehovah Making a Covenant for Israel</h2>
<p>Jehovah will make a covenant for Israel in that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of heaven, and the creeping things of the earth (v. 18a). Just as God made for us a covenant with the living things at Noah&rsquo;s time, so He will make such a covenant for Israel at the time of restoration. Because of this covenant, the beasts, the birds, and the creeping things will be in a good order. Also, God will break bow, sword, and battle from the land, and He will cause Israel to lie down in safety (v. 18b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Jehovah Betrothing Israel to Himself Forever</h2>
<p>Jehovah will betroth Israel to Himself forever (v. 19a). Indeed, He will betroth her to Himself in five of His attributes&mdash;righteousness, justice, lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness&mdash;and she will know Jehovah (vv. 19b-20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Jehovah Answering the Heavens,<br />
and the Heavens Answering the Earth</h2>
<p>In that day Jehovah will answer the heavens, and the heavens will answer the earth with rain to enable the earth to grow things (v. 21). Then the earth will answer the grain, the fresh wine, and the oil, and they will answer Jezreel, which symbolizes sowing (v. 22).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Jehovah Sowing Israel for Himself<br />
in the Land</h2>
<p>Jehovah will sow Israel for Himself in the land of Palestine (v. 23a). He will have compassion on Lo-ruhamah (meaning &ldquo;she has not obtained compassion&rdquo;), and He will say to Lo-ammi (meaning &ldquo;not My people&rdquo;), &ldquo;You are My people.&rdquo; And they will say, &ldquo;My God&rdquo; (v. 23b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Confirmation<br />
of God&rsquo;s Faithful Restoration of Israel</h2>
<p>Hosea 3:1-5 speaks of the confirmation of God&rsquo;s faithful restoration of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Telling Hosea<br />
to Love Gomer, a Woman of Adulteries, Again</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Then Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman who is loved by her companion yet who is an adulteress, even as Jehovah has loved the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes&rdquo; (v. 1). Here Jehovah told Hosea to love Gomer, a woman of adulteries, again. This symbolizes that Jehovah will love the children of Israel again, though they have turned to other lovers (other gods) and loved raisin cakes (pleasures for self). Apparently, God stopped loving Israel when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and again when Titus the prince of Rome destroyed Jerusalem. To this day Israel has been left alone, apparently without God&rsquo;s love, yet God still cares for Israel in His own way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Hosea Loving Gomer<br />
and Telling Her to Abide with Him Many Days</h2>
<p>Hosea was very obedient to God. He had married Gomer already, and she had borne him three children. Then she probably left him and committed adultery with her lovers. Later, as a symbol of His intention to love the children of Israel again, Jehovah told Hosea to love Gomer again, and Hosea did so.</p>
<p>Hosea told Gomer, the woman of harlotries, to abide with him many days without going about as a harlot nor being another man&rsquo;s, and he would be the same toward her (vv. 2-3). According to verse 4, this symbolizes that the children of Israel would abide for many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without pillar (for worship), and without ephod and teraphim (idols in homes). These &ldquo;many days&rdquo; began when the Babylonians burned the temple. For seventy years the Jews did not offer sacrifices. The temple was rebuilt, but it was utterly destroyed by Titus in A.D. 70. From that time, Israel has been without king, without prince, and without their worship by offering sacrifices to God. Furthermore, from that time until the present, a period of nearly two thousand years, the Jews have not worshipped idols.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Children of Israel Returning<br />
and Seeking Jehovah and David Their King (Christ in the Millennium)</h2>
<p>Later, as verse 5 reveals, the children of Israel will return and seek Jehovah and David their king (Christ in the millennium&mdash;Rev. 20:4, 6), and they will come with fear to Jehovah and to His goodness in the latter days (in the restoration age&mdash;Matt. 19:28).</p>
<p>What Hosea did in obedience to God&rsquo;s command regarding Gomer was a confirmation of what God promised to do regarding Israel. God told Hosea to love Gomer again as a symbol of His intention to love Israel again. Today Israel is a Gomer, but the day is coming when God will restore her to Himself.</p>
<p>This restoration will be the result of the manifestation of Christ. Once again I would emphasize the fact that in the prophetic books four things are covered repeatedly: God&rsquo;s chastisement on the Jews, God&rsquo;s punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration. God&rsquo;s chastisement and punishment will issue in the manifestation of Christ, and the manifestation of Christ will bring in the age of restoration, the millennial kingdom, which ushers the old and ruined universe into the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem. If we see these four things, we will see what a hope we have in Christ.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HOSEA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SINS OF THE APOSTATE PEOPLE,<br />
THE PUNISHMENTS OF JEHOVAH,<br />
AND<br />
THE RETURN OF THE APOSTATE PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 4&mdash;6</h1>
<p>Hosea 4&mdash;6 covers the sins of the apostate people, the punishments of Jehovah, and the return of the apostate people. In this message we will consider the details regarding these matters recorded in these three chapters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SINS OF THE APOSTATE PEOPLE<br />
AND THE PUNISHMENTS OF JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>The sins of the apostate people and the punishments of Jehovah are seen in 4:1&mdash;5:14 and 6:4-10.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Sins of Israel<br />
and the Punishments of Jehovah&mdash;<br />
concerning the People in General</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. No Faithfulness, No Kindness,<br />
and No Knowledge of God</h2>
<p>Hosea 4:1 tells us that Jehovah had a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, for there were no faithfulness or truth, no kindness, and no knowledge of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. False Swearing, Deceiving, Murder,<br />
Stealing, and Adultery</h2>
<p>Instead of truth, kindness, and the knowledge of God, there were false swearing, deceiving (not fulfilling one&rsquo;s promise), murder, stealing, and adultery (v. 2a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The People Being Violent</h2>
<p>The people were violent, and bloodshed followed bloodshed (v. 2b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Land Mourning,<br />
and the Inhabitants of the Land Languishing</h2>
<p>Because of this the land mourned, and the inhabitants of the land languished with the beasts of the field and with the birds of heaven. Indeed, even the fish of the sea would be taken away (v. 3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Sins of the People<br />
and the Punishments of Jehovah&mdash;<br />
concerning the Priests</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The People Contending with the Priest</h2>
<p>The people contended with the priest (v. 4). This was altogether contrary to God&rsquo;s law, which did not allow the people to contend with the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Priest Stumbling in the Day,<br />
and the Prophet Stumbling<br />
with the Priest in the Night</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says that the priest would stumble in the day and that the prophet would stumble with the priest in the night. Also, the mother of the priest would be destroyed by God. This tells us that they all were committing sins. The prophet cooperated with the priest to commit sin, and the mother of the priest joined them. That brought in God&rsquo;s judgment upon the mother.</p><h2 class="head3">3. God&rsquo;s People&mdash;the Priests&mdash;Being Destroyed<br />
Because of a Lack of the Knowledge of God</h2>
<p>Verse 6a tells us that God&rsquo;s people&mdash;the priests&mdash;would be destroyed because of a lack of that knowledge of God mentioned in verse 1. The people of Israel did not know God&rsquo;s regulations, and the priests also lacked that knowledge.</p>
 <h2 class="head3">4. God Rejecting the Priest</h2>
<p>God will reject the priest, for he has rejected &ldquo;that knowledge&rdquo; of God (v. 6b). Thus, he will no longer be a priest to God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. God Forgetting the Priest&rsquo;s Children</h2>
<p>God will forget the priest&rsquo;s children, since he has forgotten the law of his God (v. 6c).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. God Changing the Glory of the Priests<br />
in Their Multiplication into Shame</h2>
<p>The more the priests were multiplied, the more they sinned against God. Hence, Jehovah said that He would change their glory in their multiplication into shame (v. 7). This indicates that as God&rsquo;s priests, His serving ones, we need to be careful, for our service involves our children.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Priests Feeding<br />
on the Sin Offering of God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>Referring to the priests, verses 8 and 9 say, &ldquo;They feed on the sin of My people, / And their soul desires their iniquity. / And it will be that as it is with the people, so will it be with the priest; / Thus I will visit their ways upon them, / And I will recompense their doings to them.&rdquo; A portion of the sin offering was to be food for the priests. The priests desired that the people would sin, because the more the people sinned, the more sin offerings there would be for the priests to eat.</p>
<p>As it was with the people, so it was with the priests. This means that the priests, who had been sanctified, separated, to be a special group among the people, made themselves the same as the people, becoming low and common. Therefore, regarding the priests God said that He would visit (punish) their ways upon them and recompense their doings to them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. The Priests Eating but Not Being Filled</h2>
<p>The priests would eat but would not be filled, and they would commit fornication but would not increase, for they had ceased giving heed to Jehovah (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Sins of Israel<br />
and the Punishment of Jehovah&mdash;<br />
concerning Fornication, Wine, and Harlotries</h2>
<p>Hosea 4:11-14 is a word concerning three things that were prevailing among the Israelites&mdash;fornication, wine, and harlotries.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Fornication, Wine, and New Wine<br />
Taking Away Their Heart</h2>
<p>Fornication, wine, and new wine took away the heart of the people of Israel (v. 11). They did not have a heart for anything else.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. God&rsquo;s People Inquiring<br />
at Their Wooden Post</h2>
<p>Instead of praying to God and inquiring of Him, God&rsquo;s people inquired at their wooden post (idol), considering that their rod informed them of things. A spirit of harlotries made them err, and they had gone about as harlots away from their God (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Offering Sacrifices<br />
upon the Tops of the Mountains<br />
and Burning Incense upon the Hills</h2>
<p>Upon the tops of the mountains they offered sacrifices, and upon the hills they burned incense, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because its shade was good. Therefore, their daughters went about as harlots, and their brides committed adultery (v. 13). But God would not punish their daughters or their brides, for the men themselves went off with harlots and offered sacrifices with the cult prostitutes (v. 14a; cf. Deut. 23:17).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The People Who Had<br />
No Understanding Being Cast Down</h2>
<p>The people who had no understanding would be cast down (Hosea 4:14b).</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Sins of Israel<br />
and the Punishments of Jehovah&mdash;<br />
concerning Israel&rsquo;s Stubbornness</h2>
<p>Hosea 4:15-19 is concerned with Israel&rsquo;s stubbornness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Israel Going About as a Harlot</h2>
<p>Israel went about as a harlot, but Judah was charged not to transgress and not to come to Gilgal, nor to go up to Beth-aven, nor to swear, &ldquo;As Jehovah lives&rdquo; (v. 15). Gilgal was the focus of idolatry (9:15; 12:11; Amos 4:4; 5:5). Beth-aven means &ldquo;house of nothingness&rdquo; or &ldquo;house of idolatry.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel Being Stubborn, like a Stubborn Heifer</h2>
<p>Israel was stubborn, like a stubborn heifer (Hosea 4:16a), which is disobedient and goes its own way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah Limiting Israel in a Narrow Field</h2>
<p>In verse 16b the prophet asks, &ldquo;Will Jehovah now pasture them / Like a lamb in a spacious place?&rdquo; This indicates that Jehovah would limit Israel in a narrow field.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Ephraim Being Joined to Idols</h2>
<p>In verse 17a we are told that Ephraim was joined to idols.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Ephraim Being Left Alone</h2>
<p>In 4:17b the prophet gives a charge concerning Ephraim: &ldquo;Leave him alone.&rdquo; Ephraim was to be let go. This indicates a kind of punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Their Liquor Having Ended,<br />
and They Having Given Themselves Up to Harlotry</h2>
<p>Their liquor had ended (v. 18a), meaning that their pleasure in drinking was gone. That was God&rsquo;s punishment. They had given themselves up to harlotry; their rulers dearly loved shame (v. 18b). They were fond of drinking and harlotry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Wind Having Wrapped Her Up in Its Wings</h2>
<p>Verse 19a says that the wind had wrapped her up in its wings. It had carried her away&mdash;a kind of punishment. According to verse 19b, they would be ashamed because of their sacrifices (to idols&mdash;v. 13a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Sins of Israel<br />
and the Punishments of Jehovah&mdash;<br />
Mainly concerning the Priests,<br />
the House of the King, and the Princes</h2>
<p>In 5:1-14 and 6:4-10 we have more details about the sins of Israel and the punishments of Jehovah&mdash;mainly concerning the priests, the house of the king, and the princes.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah&rsquo;s Judgment Coming<br />
upon the Priests, upon the House of Israel,<br />
and upon the House of the King</h2>
<p>In 5:1-2 we are told that upon the priests, upon the house of Israel, and upon the house of the king Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment would come, for they had been a snare and a net for slaughtering, even though Jehovah had chastised them all.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Ephraim Having Gone About as a Harlot,<br />
and Israel Being Defiled</h2>
<p>Ephraim had gone about as a harlot, and Israel was defiled. A spirit of harlotries was within them (or, in the midst of them). Their doings did not permit them to turn to their God, and they did not know Jehovah (vv. 3-4).</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Pride of Israel Testifying to His Face</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says that the pride of Israel testifies to his face and that Ephraim and Israel would stumble in their iniquity. Judah also would stumble with them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Going to Seek Jehovah but Not Finding Him</h2>
<p>With their flocks and herds they would go to seek Jehovah, but they would not find Him. He had withdrawn Himself from them (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Acting Treacherously against Jehovah</h2>
<p>They had acted treacherously against Jehovah, for they had begotten strange (illegitimate) children. The invaders at the new moon would devour them with their apportionments, with their possessions (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Ephraim Being a Desolation<br />
in the Day of Correction</h2>
<p>Behind Benjamin would be the enemies, and Ephraim would be a desolation in the day of correction (punishment). This was sure (vv. 8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Princes of Judah Becoming like<br />
Those Who Move a Boundary Mark</h2>
<p>The princes of Judah had become like those who move a boundary mark to enlarge the size of their estates, and Jehovah would pour out upon them His overflowing wrath like water (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Ephraim Being Oppressed, Crushed by Judgment</h2>
<p>Ephraim was oppressed, crushed by judgment, for he was determined to walk after man&rsquo;s command (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. Jehovah Being like a Moth to Ephraim</h2>
<p>Jehovah was like a moth to Ephraim and like rottenness to the house of Judah (v. 12). In the Bible God is usually likened to positive things, but here He is likened to negative things, things that consume.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. Ephraim Going to Assyria</h2>
<p>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to King Jareb. But that king could not heal him, and the wound would not depart from him (v. 13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. Jehovah Being like a Lion to Ephraim<br />
and like a Young Lion to the House of Judah</h2>
<p>Jehovah would be like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. He would tear them and go away. He would carry them off, and there would be no one to deliver them out of His hand (v. 14).</p>
<h2 class="head3">12. The Lovingkindness of Ephraim and Judah<br />
Being like a Morning Cloud<br />
and like Dew That Departs Early</h2>
<p>The lovingkindness of Ephraim (Israel) and Judah was like a morning cloud and like dew that departs early. Therefore, Jehovah hewed them to pieces by the prophets. He slew them by the words of His mouth, and His judgments went forth as light. For He delights in lovingkindness and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings (6:4-6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. They like Adam<br />
Having Transgressed the Covenant</h2>
<p>They like Adam (or, men) had transgressed the covenant. There they had acted treacherously against Jehovah (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">14. Gilead Being a City of Those<br />
Who Commit Iniquity</h2>
<p>Gilead was a city of those who commit iniquity; it was tracked with blood. Like bands of robbers lying in wait for a man, the company of priests murdered on the way to Shechem, committing wickedness (vv. 8-9). Once again, this was the sin that involved the priests, who had become robbers.</p>
<h2 class="head3">15. In the House of Israel<br />
Jehovah Having Seen a Horrid Thing</h2>
<p>In the house of Israel Jehovah had seen a horrid thing: the harlotry of Ephraim was there; Israel had defiled itself (v. 10).</p>
<p>As we consider all these details concerning Israel&rsquo;s situation, we can realize how sinful Israel had become.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE RETURN OF THE APOSTATE PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In 5:15&mdash;6:3, 11 the prophet Hosea speaks regarding the return of the apostate people. We may wonder how it can be possible for such a sinful people to return. They can return because they are under God&rsquo;s compassions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah Going Away and Returning<br />
to His Place, until the Apostate People<br />
Acknowledge Their Offense and Seek His Face</h2>
<p>According to 5:15a Jehovah will go away and return to His place, until the apostate people acknowledge their offense and seek His face. Eventually, in their affliction (the divine chastisement) they will seek Him earnestly (v. 15b). Thus, the divine chastisement of Israel will be effective.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Return of the Apostate People</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. A Word concerning Coming<br />
and Returning to Jehovah,<br />
Who Will Heal Them and Bind Them Up</h2>
<p>In 6:1 we have a word concerning Israel&rsquo;s coming and returning to Jehovah. In this verse the prophet says, &ldquo;Come and let us return to Jehovah, / For He has torn us, but He will heal us, / And He has stricken us, but He will bind us up.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Enlivening Them after Two Days</h2>
<p>Hosea 6:2 says, &ldquo;He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up, / And we will live in His presence.&rdquo; What are the &ldquo;two days,&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;the third day&rdquo; in this verse? In the Bible there is a principle that &ldquo;with the Lord one day is like a thousand years&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:8). According to this principle, the two days here might signify the first two periods of a thousand years each, counting from A.D. 70, when the Roman prince Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, cruelly killed thousands of Jews, and scattered the Jews among the nations. From that time the Jews have been without king, without prince, without sacrifice, and without the temple, fulfilling Hosea&rsquo;s prophecy in 3:4. For two thousand years God has left Israel in a dead condition. After this two-thousand-year period, the third thousand years will come. The third day in 6:2 might signify the third period of a thousand years, that is, the millennium, the age of restoration, in the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. A Word concerning Knowing Jehovah<br />
and concerning Christ&rsquo;s Going Forth as the Dawn<br />
and His Coming as the Rain</h2>
<p>In Hosea 6:3 there is a word concerning knowing Jehovah and concerning Christ&rsquo;s going forth as the dawn and His coming as the rain. The first part of the verse says, &ldquo;Therefore let us know, let us pursue knowing Jehovah.&rdquo; The remainder of the verse says that Christ&rsquo;s going forth is as sure as the dawn. He will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain which waters the earth (in the restoration of the millennium&mdash;Matt. 19:28; Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah&rsquo;s Promise to Judah<br />
in the Return of the Apostate People</h2>
<p>In Hosea 6:11 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s promise to Judah in the return of the apostate people. This promise is that there will be a harvest appointed for Judah, when Jehovah will turn the captivity of His people. This means that in the restoration all the Israelites, including the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah, will be very rich in all kinds of produce from the earth. The earth was created by God to produce a rich harvest, but due to the fall of man, the earth was cursed to grow thorns, and man has had to labor with sweat for food (Gen. 3:17-19). In the restoration time the earth will be restored to its original condition and will be rich, fertile, and productive. Thus, a harvest will be apportioned to Judah for their enjoyment.</p>
<p>From the time that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded Israel in 606 B.C., three things have been taking place on earth. The first is God&rsquo;s loving chastisement over His dear elect Israel, and the second is God&rsquo;s punishment on all the nations. These two things added together bring in the third thing&mdash;the manifestation of Christ. The manifestation of Christ will bring in a fourth thing&mdash;the age of restoration, the millennial kingdom. This restoration will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<p>The manifestation of Christ does not refer only to Christ&rsquo;s second coming. The manifestation of Christ is a long process which began with Christ&rsquo;s coming to mankind, and even into mankind, at His incarnation and which will continue until Christ&rsquo;s coming back. Micah 5:2, referring to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, says that His goings forth are from the days of eternity. Christ&rsquo;s goings forth are His coming. Thus, in eternity past, Christ was ready to go forth; that is, He was ready to come. At His incarnation Christ came out of eternity into time, coming with His divinity into humanity. Actually, Christ&rsquo;s goings forth, His coming, have not ceased. Even today He is still coming. This manifestation, which began with the incarnation, will be consummated in Christ&rsquo;s coming back with the overcomers as the mighty ones to defeat Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire is the last of the human governments according to the great image in Daniel 2. It was through the Roman Empire that Christ was born in a way that fulfilled the prophecy in Micah 5:2 concerning the place of His birth. It was also through the Roman Empire that Christ accomplished His redemption by being crucified, and it was under the Roman Empire that the Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost to initiate the church life. With the help of the Roman Empire, the apostles, especially the apostle Paul, spread the gospel in Asia and Europe. Later, the Lord used imperialism to spread the gospel to Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Australia. Today Russia, a country of three hundred fifty million people, has been opened to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery by God&rsquo;s punishment upon the nations for the spreading of the gospel, which equals the manifestation of Christ. Our going to Russia today to minister the proper spiritual food is the spreading of the manifestation of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<h1 class="title">ON HOSEA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SINS OF ISRAEL IN FORSAKING JEHOVAH<br />
AND<br />
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S PUNISHMENTS ON ISRAEL<br />
BECAUSE OF THEIR FORSAKING OF HIM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 7&mdash;8</h1>
<p>Chapters seven and eight of Hosea cover the sins of Israel in forsaking Jehovah and Jehovah&rsquo;s punishments on Israel because of their forsaking of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SINS OF ISRAEL IN FORSAKING JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>The sins of Israel were in two categories: sins in their social life among the people and the rulers and evils in their relationship with Jehovah. Israel was wrong with man and also with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Sins in Their Social Life<br />
among the People and the Rulers</h2>
<p>Hosea 7:1-7 speaks of the sins of Israel in their social life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Falsehood, Theft, Raids,<br />
Evils, Lies, Intoxication, and Scorn</h2>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s sins in their social life included falsehood, theft, raids, evils, lies, intoxication, and scorn (7:1-3, 5). On the feast day of the king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine, and the king stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Adultery Practiced by All of the People</h2>
<p>Adultery was practiced by all of the people. They burned like an oven in their lust, devouring their judges (the priests) and making all their kings fall (vv. 4, 6-7). Hosea used the parable of a baker to portray Israel&rsquo;s burning lust. Even the kings could not stand against the burning lust within them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Evils in Their Relationship with Jehovah</h2>
<p>In verses 8 through 16 Hosea speaks regarding Israel&rsquo;s evils in their relationship with Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Wandering from Jehovah</h2>
<p>They wandered from Jehovah, not returning to Him and not seeking after Him (vv. 13, 10, 16a, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Ephraim Being Likened to Three Things</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. An Unturned Cake</h2>
<p>Ephraim (another term for the northern kingdom of Israel) was likened to an unturned cake (v. 8). This symbolizes that they were stubborn to remain in a charcoaled condition and would not turn to Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. A Silly Dove</h2>
<p>Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;Ephraim has become like a silly dove / Without understanding: / They call to Egypt; / They go to Assyria. / When they go, / I will spread My net over them; / I will bring them down like the birds of heaven; / I will chasten them according to the report given to their assembly.&rdquo; Israel&rsquo;s being likened to a silly dove symbolizes that they were lacking the proper knowledge of God in His economy. Many of today&rsquo;s Christians are lacking the knowledge of God&rsquo;s economy. They do not realize that God&rsquo;s present chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations will issue in the manifestation of Christ to bring in the restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. A Deceitful Bow</h2>
<p>In verse 16a Israel is likened to a deceitful bow. This symbolizes that they were rebellious toward God and were not faithful to fight the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S PUNISHMENTS ON ISRAEL<br />
BECAUSE OF THEIR FORSAKING OF HIM</h2>
<p>Chapter eight describes Jehovah&rsquo;s punishments on Israel because of their forsaking of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Like an Eagle the Enemy Coming<br />
against the House of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Like an eagle the enemy would come against the house of Jehovah, because they had trespassed Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant&mdash; Jehovah&rsquo;s binding of Israel in His holy requirements and righteous terms&mdash;and because they had transgressed against Jehovah&rsquo;s law&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s regulating of Israel according to what He is: love, light, holiness, and righteousness (8:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Israel Having Cast Off What Is Good</h2>
<p>Israel had cast off what is good, and the enemy would pursue him (v. 3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. They Having Set Up Kings<br />
but Not by Jehovah</h2>
<p>They had set up kings but not by Jehovah. They had set up princes, but Jehovah did not acknowledge it (v. 4a). They had their own way of setting up an authority, and Jehovah objected to it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. With Their Silver and Gold<br />
Making Idols for Themselves</h2>
<p>With their silver and gold they made idols for themselves, that they might be cut off (v. 4b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Samaria&rsquo;s Calf Having Cast Israel Off</h2>
<p>Verse 5a says, &ldquo;Your calf has cast you off, O Samaria; / My anger burns against them.&rdquo; Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, and her &ldquo;calf&rdquo; was an idol, a golden calf image (cf. 1 Kings 12:28; Exo. 32:4). This idol cast Israel off, and Jehovah&rsquo;s anger burned against them.</p>
<p>Verse 5b goes on to say, &ldquo;How long will they be incapable of innocence?&rdquo; Here to be incapable of innocence means to be incapable of not making idols. Israel lacked the capacity not to make idols; that is, they were very capable and active in making idols. Thus, Hosea was asking when they would lose their capacity to make idols, when they would no longer be able to make idols. The situation of humankind today is the same. Human beings may not be capable of understanding the Bible or of knowing God, but they are very capable in making many things their idols.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Calf of Samaria<br />
Being Shattered to Pieces</h2>
<p>Hosea 8:6 says, &ldquo;For from Israel is this! / A workman made it; / Thus it is no God. / The calf of Samaria / Will be shattered to pieces.&rdquo; One day God will come in to shatter that idol to pieces.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. In Making Idols Having Sown Wind<br />
and Reaping a Whirlwind</h2>
<p>In making idols they had sown wind and would reap a whirlwind (v. 7a). Because of the whirlwind, they would be lacking in food. For this reason, verse 7b continues, &ldquo;It has no stalk; should there be a sprout, / It will not produce flour; / If so be that it does produce, / Strangers will swallow it up.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Israel Becoming among the Nations<br />
like a Vessel in Which No One Takes Pleasure</h2>
<p>Israel had been swallowed up and had become among the nations like a vessel in which no one takes pleasure (v. 8). For they had gone up to Assyria like a wild ass alone by itself. Ephraim had hired lovers (v. 9). Though they had hired such among the nations, Jehovah would gather them for their punishment, and they would begin to be diminished because of the burden of the king of the princes (v. 10). Today there is a little nation in Palestine with Jerusalem as its center, but what nation takes pleasure in Israel?</p>
 <h2 class="head2">E. Ephraim Having Multiplied Altars</h2>
<p>Because Ephraim had multiplied altars, altars would be multiplied to him for sin (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Writing for Ephraim<br />
the Ten Thousand Things of His Law</h2>
<p>Jehovah wrote for Ephraim the ten thousand things of His law, but they were considered a strange thing (v. 12). This means that Ephraim, the kingdom of Israel, did not care for God&rsquo;s law. No matter how many items God wrote, Ephraim did not care for them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. They Sacrificing Flesh and Eating It,<br />
but Jehovah Having No Delight in Them</h2>
<p>As for the sacrifices of Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings, they sacrificed flesh and ate it, but Jehovah had no delight in them. He would remember their iniquity and would punish their sins, and they would return to Egypt (v. 13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Israel Having Forgotten His Maker<br />
and Having Built Palaces,<br />
and Judah Having Multiplied Fortified Cities</h2>
<p>Israel had forgotten his Maker and had built palaces, and Judah had multiplied fortified cities. But Jehovah would send fire into his cities, and it would devour its palaces (v. 14).</p>
<p>The minor prophets spoke concerning the evils, the rottenness, and the corruption of Israel, but Israel was stubborn and would not listen to them. Eventually, God was forced to send Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian army as the fire to judge, to punish, and to chastise His rebellious and apostate people.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HOSEA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE IDOLATRY OF ISRAEL AGAINST JEHOVAH<br />
AND<br />
THE PUNISHMENTS OF JEHOVAH UPON ISRAEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 9&mdash;10</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider from Hosea 9 and 10 the matters of the idolatry of Israel against Jehovah and the punishments of Jehovah upon Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE IDOLATRY OF ISRAEL AGAINST JEHOVAH<br />
BEING LIKE A WIFE&rsquo;S HARLOTRIES<br />
AGAINST HER HUSBAND</h2>
<p>The idolatry of Israel against Jehovah was like a wife&rsquo;s harlotries against her husband (1:2; 2:13; 3:1). Hosea&rsquo;s thought here is very deep because it indicates God&rsquo;s organic union with His people. However, the wife&rsquo;s situation was exceedingly ugly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. ISRAEL HAVING GONE<br />
AS A HARLOT AWAY FROM HER GOD</h2>
<p>Israel was told not to rejoice, for she had gone as a harlot away from her God. She had loved payment, like a harlot, upon every grain floor, worshipping idols on every threshing floor (9:1). The threshing floor was a place where people earned their living. Thus, they worshipped idols in the place where they earned their living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE THRESHING FLOOR<br />
AND THE WINEPRESS NOT FEEDING THEM</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says that the threshing floor and the winepress would not feed them, and the new wine would fail them. Whatever they had would not be sufficient to take care of their need. They would desire wine to drink, but there would be none.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THEY NOT DWELLING IN THE LAND OF JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>According to verse 3, Israel would not dwell in the land of Jehovah. Rather, they would return to Egypt, and in Assyria they would eat what was unclean.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THEY NOT POURING OUT<br />
OFFERINGS OF WINE TO JEHOVAH,<br />
AND THEIR SACRIFICES NOT BEING PLEASING TO HIM</h2>
<p>They would not pour out offerings of wine to Jehovah, neither would their sacrifices be pleasing to Him. Their sacrifices would be to them as the bread of mourning, the bread eaten by a family who had lost a relative. All who ate such sacrifices would be unclean, for their bread would be for themselves and would not come into the house of Jehovah (v. 4). They did not have the real enjoyment, and what they offered to God in name was not for God but for themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THEY NOT PARTICIPATING<br />
IN THE DAY OF ASSEMBLY<br />
AND IN THE DAY OF THE FEAST OF JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>Verse 5 indicates that they would not participate in the day of assembly and in the day of the feast of Jehovah. They did not care for the feast of Jehovah but only for their own necessities, enjoyment, and pleasures.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THEY ESCAPING FROM DESTRUCTION,<br />
BUT EGYPT GATHERING THEM,<br />
AND MOPH BURYING THEM</h2>
<p>They would escape from destruction, from the evil that was coming upon them. But Egypt would gather them, and Moph (Memphis, an Egyptian city near the Nile) would bury them. As for their desirable things of silver (idols), nettles would dispossess them. Thistles would be in their tents (v. 6). On the one hand, this is a picture of punishment; on the other hand, it is a picture of how sinful they were. They did not even care for their lodging but only for their sinful enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE DAYS OF VISITATION HAVING COME</h2>
<p>Verse 7 says that the days of visitation had come; the days of the recompense had come. The prophet was a fool, and the inspired man was mad, because of the greatness of Israel&rsquo;s iniquity and because of the greatness of the enmity. Instead of love and sympathy among the people, there were hatred and enmity. They considered a man of the spirit, or an inspired one, as mad. This indicates that they did not care for God&rsquo;s interests. On the contrary, they thought that caring for God&rsquo;s interests was foolishness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. EPHRAIM HAVING BEEN<br />
A WATCHMAN WITH GOD</h2>
<p>Verse 8a says, &ldquo;Ephraim was a watchman / With my God.&rdquo; This indicates that in the past the northern kingdom of Israel was quite good.</p>
<p>Verse 8b continues, &ldquo;As for the prophet, a fowler&rsquo;s trap / Is in all his ways; / Enmity is in the house of his God.&rdquo; This may mean that the prophets had become so evil that wherever they went they were a trap to snare the people. In the temple the prophets created enmity; they did not have love or sympathy.</p>
<p>In verse 9 Hosea goes on to say concerning Ephraim, &ldquo;They have deeply corrupted themselves / As in the days of Gibeah; / He will remember their iniquity; / He will punish their sins.&rdquo; The corruption of Ephraim was so great that it matched the corruption in the days of Gibeah described in Judges 19:15-30. Because Israel had become like those in the days of Gibeah, God would come in to punish their sins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. JEHOVAH FINDING ISRAEL<br />
LIKE GRAPES IN THE WILDERNESS, AND<br />
SEEING THEIR FATHERS AS THE FIRST RIPE FRUIT<br />
ON THE FIG TREE AT ITS BEGINNING</h2>
<p>Jehovah found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, and saw their fathers as the first ripe fruit on the fig tree at its beginning (Hosea 9:10a). This refers to the time of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; with Israel. At the time of the exodus from Egypt, God considered Israel a young wife. However, when this wife grew up, she left God for Baal and went to Baal-peor (a city named after the idol Baal of Peor&mdash;Num. 25:3; Psa. 106:28) and sanctified herself unto the shameful thing (idol) and became an abomination, like the thing (idol) that she loved (Hosea 9:10b).</p>
<h2 class="head1">XI. THE GLORY OF EPHRAIM FLYING AWAY<br />
LIKE A BIRD</h2>
<p>The glory of Ephraim, the glory of the northern kingdom of Israel, would fly away like a bird. This means that there would be no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception. Even if they brought up their children, Jehovah would bereave them, so that not a man would be left. Indeed woe would also be to them when Jehovah turned away from them. Ephraim was planted in Tyre in a meadow, but he would still bring forth his children to the slayer. Jehovah would give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. All their evil was in Gilgal (the focus of idolatry&mdash;4:15), for there Jehovah hated them. Because of the evil of their doings, Jehovah would drive them from His house; He would love them no more. All their princes were rebels. Ephraim was stricken. Their root was dried up; they would not bear fruit. If they brought forth, Jehovah would kill the beloved fruit of their womb. God had rejected them, for they did not listen to Him. They would be wanderers among the nations (9:11-17).</p><h2 class="head1">XII. ISRAEL BEING A LUXURIANT VINE<br />
BRINGING FORTH FRUIT FOR HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Hosea 10:1a says, &ldquo;Israel is a luxuriant vine; / He brings forth fruit for himself.&rdquo; The fruit of the vine should have been offered to God as a drink offering, but they used the vines to bring forth fruit for themselves, not for God.</p>
 <p>Verse 1b and 2 continue, &ldquo;According to the abundance of his fruit / He has multiplied altars; / According to the goodness of their land / They have made pillars well. / Their heart is divided; / Now they will be found guilty. / He will break down their altars; / He will destroy their pillars.&rdquo; Israel became rich, but they used their produce to build up altars and to make idols. Therefore, Hosea said that God would break down their altars and destroy their pillars.</p>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;For now they will say, / We have no king, / For we did not fear Jehovah; / And the king, what can he do for us?&rdquo; Because they did not fear Jehovah, they could not have God&rsquo;s deputy authority (a king). This refers to the headship, the leadership, among God&rsquo;s people. When the church is proper, the church has the headship, the leadership, representing God as His authority. But in a time of turmoil, some would say, &ldquo;Why do we need God&rsquo;s deputy authority? Why do we need to have any headship or leadership?&rdquo; This issues in anarchy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIII. THEY SPEAKING MERE WORDS,<br />
SWEARING FALSELY WHILE MAKING A COVENANT</h2>
<p>In verses 4 through 8 we have further details concerning the idolatry of Israel against Jehovah and the punishments of Jehovah upon Israel. They spoke mere words, swearing falsely while making a covenant. Judgment sprouted forth like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field. The inhabitants of Samaria would fear for the calves (the idols) of Beth-aven (probably a contemptuous name applied to Bethel, which was a seat of idolatry&mdash;1 Kings 12:26-33; Hosea 4:15). Its people would mourn over it, and its idol priests would tremble for it, for its glory, because it had departed from it. It would be carried to Assyria: a present to King Jareb. Ephraim would be taken in shame, and Israel would be ashamed of his own counsel. Samaria would be cut off with her king and would be like sticks, or small pieces of wood, on the surface of the water. The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, would be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle would come up upon their altars, and they would &ldquo;say to the mountains, Cover us! / And to the hills, Fall on us!&rdquo; (v. 8). This is Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Israel and on her idolatry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIV. ISRAEL HAVING SINNED SINCE<br />
THE DAYS OF GIBEAH</h2>
<p>Israel had sinned since the days of Gibeah (v. 9a). Israel thought that the battle which took place in Gibeah against the children of iniquity could not overtake them (v. 9b; Judg. 19:15-30). But Jehovah said that He would chasten them for their &ldquo;double iniquity&rdquo; (Hosea 10:10). This double iniquity refers to Israel&rsquo;s two evils: forsaking Jehovah and turning to idols (Jer. 2:13). Israel&rsquo;s sins in their social life were due to their sin of forsaking God and turning to idols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XV. EPHRAIM BEING A TRAINED HEIFER<br />
THAT LOVES TO TREAD THE GRAIN,<br />
BUT JEHOVAH HAVING PASSED<br />
THE YOKE OVER HER FAIR NECK</h2>
<p>Ephraim was a trained heifer that loved to tread the grain. But Jehovah had passed the yoke over her fair neck. Jehovah would make Ephraim draw the plow. Judah would plow, and Jacob would break his clods (Hosea 10:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">XVI. THE CHARGE TO SOW<br />
UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THEMSELVES,<br />
TO REAP ACCORDING TO LOVINGKINDNESS,<br />
AND TO BREAK UP THEIR FALLOW GROUND</h2>
<p>Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;Sow unto righteousness for yourselves; / Reap according to lovingkindness; / Break up your fallow ground; / For it is time to seek Jehovah / Until He comes and rains / Righteousness on you. / You have plowed wickedness; / You have reaped injustice; / You have eaten the fruit of lying. / For you have trusted in your way, / In the multitude of your mighty men.&rdquo; This is similar to what Paul says in Galatians 6:7 and 8, where he tells us that if we sow unto the flesh, we will reap corruption of the flesh, but if we sow unto the Spirit, we will of the Spirit reap eternal life. Here in Hosea 10:12 to sow means to seek Jehovah. To seek Jehovah rightly is to sow rightly. Thus, Hosea charged the children of Israel to sow unto righteousness. If they did this, they would reap according to lovingkindness. Otherwise, if they plowed wickedness, they would reap injustice.</p>
<p>In verse 12 Hosea uses the expression &ldquo;fallow ground.&rdquo; Fallow ground is ground that has been plowed but has not been sown with anything. The children of Israel were the fallow ground. They had been plowed by God, but had not been sown with righteousness. They were to break up the fallow ground; that is, they were to seek God until Christ came as righteousness to rain righteousness upon them.</p>
<p>However, Israel did not sow properly. They trusted in their own way and in the multitude of their mighty men. Therefore, God caused them to be utterly destroyed. Regarding this, verses 14 and 15 say, &ldquo;A tumult will arise among your peoples; / And all your fortresses will be devastated, / As Shalman devastated Beth-arbel / In the day of battle: / The mother was dashed in pieces with the children. / Thus Bethel will cause this to happen to you / Because of your great evil: / At dawn the king of Israel / Will be utterly cut off.&rdquo; This was fully fulfilled by Titus in A.D. 70.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; in verse 15 indicates that Israel was in the night, in darkness. They were a people who were altogether lacking in righteousness and justice. They forsook God and they were evil to one another.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S UNCHANGING LOVE<br />
VERSUS<br />
ISRAEL&rsquo;S STUBBORN UNCHASTITY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 11&mdash;14</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider chapters eleven through fourteen. These chapters are concerned with Jehovah&rsquo;s unchanging love versus Israel&rsquo;s stubborn unchastity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ISRAEL&rsquo;S STUBBORN UNCHASTITY</h2>
<p>The highest virtue of a proper wife is chastity. A wife may be very good in every respect, but if she is not chaste, she is still not a proper wife. Israel was stubborn in her unchastity toward Jehovah her Husband.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Prophets Calling Them</h2>
<p>God sent the prophets to call Israel again and again, but the more the prophets called them, the farther they went away from the prophets. &ldquo;As they called them, / So they went from them; / To the Baals they sacrificed, / And to the idols they burned incense&rdquo; (11:2). They served the Baals with their offerings of sacrifices.</p>
<p>From the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70 until now, God has not raised up any prophets among the Jews. This is God&rsquo;s doing. In Matthew 21:43 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that &ldquo;the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit.&rdquo; This nation is the church. In the church God has raised up many prophets. Furthermore, in the church every reborn one is a priest (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). As long as we are children of God, we are priests. In addition to being God&rsquo;s priests serving Him in the gospel (Rom. 15:16), we all need to endeavor to prophesy. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul charged us to desire earnestly to prophesy (vv. 1, 39) and said that we all can prophesy one by one (v. 31). The Lord has shown us that, in His recovery today, He wants to recover 1 Corinthians 14, that is, to recover the prophesying of every believer. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day, after remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father at the Lord&rsquo;s table, all the members of the church should prophesy. This means that they all should speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. If we all, the young ones and the old ones, prophesy one by one, how rich, how high, how fresh, how living, and how powerful that would be! We all must honor God&rsquo;s ordained way in 1 Corinthians 14. We were regenerated to be priests. Now we need to endeavor to prophesy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. They Refusing to Return to Jehovah</h2>
<p>They would not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian would be their king, for they refused to return to Jehovah. The sword would whirl about in their cities, consume their bars, and devour them because of their own counsels. They were bent upon turning away from Jehovah. Though the prophets called them to Him who is on high, none at all exalted Him (Hosea 11:5-7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Ephraim Encompassing Jehovah with Lies</h2>
<p>Ephraim encompassed Jehovah with lies, and the house of Israel, with deceit (v. 12). When they came to God, they lied. Judah was yet unsteadfast with God and with the Holy One, the Faithful One.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Ephraim Feeding on Wind<br />
and Following the East Wind Continually</h2>
<p>Hosea 12:1 says that Ephraim fed on wind (on vanity and in vain) and followed the east wind continually (in emptiness). He multiplied lies and violence. They made a covenant with Assyria (not with Jehovah), and oil was carried to Egypt (not into the temple of God). This was their situation in their stubborn unchastity.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">E. Jehovah Having Also a Controversy<br />
with Judah and Punishing Jacob<br />
according to His Ways</h2>
<p>Verse 2 tells us that Jehovah had also a controversy with Judah. This means that He was contending, arguing, with Judah. Jehovah would punish Jacob according to his ways. According to his doings He would recompense him. In the womb he grasped his brother by the heel (v. 3a; Gen. 25:26). &ldquo;Jacob fled into the country of Aram; / And Israel served for a wife, / And for a wife he kept sheep&rdquo; (Hosea 12:12; Gen. 29:20, 30; 31:38-41). In his full strength he contended with God (Hosea 12:3b). &ldquo;Indeed he contended with the Angel [Christ] and prevailed; / He wept and made supplication to Him&rdquo; (v. 4a; Gen. 32:24-32).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Ephraim Being a Merchant</h2>
<p>Ephraim was a merchant. In his hand were balances of deceit, and he loved to extort (v. 7). Ephraim said, &ldquo;I have surely become rich; / I have found wealth for myself. / In all my labors / They will find with me / No iniquity, which would be sin&rdquo; (v. 8). In Ephraim&rsquo;s hands were two kinds of balances: one that weighed light for buying and one that weighed heavy for selling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Gilead Being Iniquity</h2>
<p>Gilead was iniquity (6:8). They were altogether vanity. In Gilgal (the focus of idolatry) they sacrificed bullocks. Indeed their altars were like heaps in the furrows of a field (12:11). This was a figure of speech to describe Israel&rsquo;s stubborn unchastity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Ephraim Provoking Jehovah to Bitter Anger</h2>
<p>Ephraim provoked Jehovah to bitter anger. Therefore, his Lord would leave his bloodshed upon him and would recompense him with his own reproach (v. 14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Being like a Morning Cloud<br />
and like Dew That Departs Early,<br />
like Chaff Driven by a Storm Wind,<br />
and like Smoke from a Window Vent</h2>
<p>When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, but he trespassed through Baal and died. Now they sinned more and more and made molten images for themselves out of their silver, idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of craftsmen. They asked those who sacrificed to kiss the calves (idols). Therefore, they would be like a morning cloud and like dew that departs early, like chaff driven by a storm wind from the threshing floor, and like smoke from a window vent (13:1-3). These too are figures used by Hosea to describe the vanity of the sinful life of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Their Heart Being Exalted,<br />
and They Having Forgotten Jehovah</h2>
<p>After they became full, their heart was exalted. Therefore, they forgot Jehovah (v. 6). Thus Jehovah would be to them like a lion; like a leopard Jehovah would watch them along the way. Jehovah would meet them like a bear robbed of her cubs, He would tear away the covering of their heart, and He would devour them there like a lioness. The beast of the field would tear them to pieces (vv. 7-8). This is Hosea&rsquo;s poetic writing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. It Being Their Destruction<br />
That Israel Was against Jehovah</h2>
<p>It was their destruction that Israel was against Jehovah, against their help. Their king could not save them in all their cities. Jehovah gave them a king in His anger and took away the king in His overflowing wrath (vv. 9-11). The king given by Jehovah in His anger might have been Saul, who was eventually taken away by Jehovah in His overflowing wrath.</p>
<h2 class="head2">L. The Iniquity of Ephraim Being Bound Up</h2>
<p>The iniquity of Ephraim was bound up; his sin was laid up in store. The pains of a woman giving birth would come upon him. He was an unwise son; for he should not have delayed at the time the children broke forth (vv. 12-13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">M. A Wind of Jehovah<br />
Coming from the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Verses 15 and 16 say that even if Samaria should be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind would come, a wind of Jehovah coming up from the wilderness, and his spring would become dry, and his fountain would be dried up. The enemy would plunder the treasure of every desirable vessel. Samaria would be guilty, for she rebelled against her God. They would fall by the sword. Their children would be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women would be ripped up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">N. Israel Having Fallen by His Iniquity</h2>
<p>Finally, 14:1b says that Israel had fallen by his iniquity.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HOSEA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(7)</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S UNCHANGING LOVE<br />
VERSUS<br />
ISRAEL&rsquo;S STUBBORN UNCHASTITY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 11&mdash;14</h1>
<p>The first main emphasis of the book of Hosea is the metaphor of Hosea&rsquo;s marriage with the harlot Gomer. Their three children were also metaphors. The son Jezreel symbolized that God would avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel (2 Kings 10:1-11) upon the house of Jehu and would bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel (2 Kings 15:10-12). The daughter Lo-ruhamah symbolized that God would no longer have compassion on the house of Israel. The son Lo-ammi symbolized that Israel was not God&rsquo;s people. God used Hosea&rsquo;s marriage to Gomer and his family to demonstrate how Israel as a wife to Jehovah had become unfaithful to her Husband.</p>
<p>The second emphasis in the book of Hosea is the evils of Israel as the unchaste wife of Jehovah. Once a wife becomes unchaste, all kinds of evils follow. Once we forsake God, we too can do any kind of evil. As the unchaste wife of Jehovah, Israel was stubborn in her unchastity. This stubbornness is described in detail in chapters eleven through fourteen. These chapters also reveal Jehovah&rsquo;s unchanging love, and this is what we will consider in this message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S UNCHANGING LOVE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah Loving Israel When Israel Was a Child,<br />
and out of Egypt Jehovah Calling His Son</h2>
<p>Hosea 11:1 says, &ldquo;When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.&rdquo; Israel is depicted as the wife of Jehovah throughout the book of Hosea. But when God&rsquo;s everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God&rsquo;s son (Exo. 4:22-23), indicating that Israel has the Father&rsquo;s life. Only real sons, not adopted sons, have their father&rsquo;s life. Hosea 11:1 also indicates that Christ joined Israel to be the Son of God and that He was called out of Egypt by God (Matt. 2:13-15).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s everlasting love is not a love in affection, like the love of a husband toward a wife, but a love in life, like the love of a father toward a son. Love toward a wife is love in affection, but love toward a son is love in life. On the one hand, God loves us as His wife, and the Lord Jesus is our Husband. On the other hand, God is our Father, and we are sons of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah Calling Israel by His Prophets</h2>
<p>Hosea 11:2a says that Jehovah called Israel by His prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah Teaching Ephraim to Walk</h2>
<p>Verse 3 goes on to say that Jehovah taught Ephraim (Israel) to walk, taking them in His arms and healing them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah Drawing the Children of Israel<br />
with Cords of a Man, with Bands of Love</h2>
<p>Verse 4a says, &ldquo;I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;with cords of a man, with bands of love&rdquo; indicates that God loves us with His divine love, not on the level of His divinity but on the level of His humanity. God&rsquo;s love in teaching Ephraim to walk and in taking Ephraim in His arms shows us that God&rsquo;s love is divine but on a human level. If He loved us on the divine level, we could not touch His love. His divine love reaches us on a human level. He has come down to the human level in order to reach us. This is what it means to say that He drew Israel with the cords of a man, with bands of love.</p>
 <p>The remainder of verse 4 says, &ldquo;I was to them like those / Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; / And I gently caused them to eat.&rdquo; This yoke was Pharaoh&rsquo;s yoke, and this eating was the eating of the manna in the wilderness. Pharaoh had put a strong yoke on Israel, but God took off that yoke and gently caused them to eat by bringing them into the wilderness, where God fed them with manna in a gentle way morning by morning (Exo. 16:14-18).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Jehovah Not Giving Ephraim Up</h2>
<p>Hosea 11:8 and 9 reveal that Jehovah could not give Ephraim up. &ldquo;How shall I give you up, O Ephraim? / How shall I deliver you up, O Israel? / How can I make you like Admah? / How can I treat you like Zeboim? / My heart is turned within Me; / All My compassions have warmed. / I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; / I will not return to destroy Ephraim; / For I am God and not man, / The Holy One in the midst of you, / And I will not come in wrath.&rdquo; Admah and Zeboim were destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 14:8; Deut. 29:23). Ephraim had become so evil, even more evil than Sodom and Gomorrah. However, because of His everlasting love, God would not destroy Ephraim.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Children of Israel Walking after Jehovah,<br />
and Jehovah Causing Them<br />
to Dwell in Their Houses</h2>
<p>According to Hosea 11:10 and 11, the children of Israel will walk after Jehovah. He will roar like a lion, and the children of Israel will come trembling from the west like a bird from Egypt and like a dove from the land of Assyria. Jehovah will cause them to dwell in their houses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. At Bethel Jacob Finding Jehovah,<br />
and There Jehovah Speaking<br />
with the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>At Bethel Jacob found Jehovah, and there Jehovah spoke with the children of Israel, even Jehovah, the God of hosts. Jehovah is his memorial. The children of Israel should return there to their God, keep lovingkindness and justice, and wait on their God continually (12:4b-6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Since the Land of Egypt<br />
Jehovah Having Been<br />
the God of the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>Since the land of Egypt Jehovah has been the God of the children of Israel. He will again cause them to dwell in tents as in the days of the appointed feast. He has also spoken unto the prophets. He has multiplied vision, and through the prophets He has used similitudes (vv. 9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Israel Knowing That<br />
There is No God except Jehovah</h2>
<p>Israel was to know that there was no god except Jehovah, for there is no savior besides Him. He knew Israel in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. According to their pasturage (given by Jehovah) they became full (13:4-6a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Jehovah Ransoming Them<br />
from the Power of Sheol</h2>
<p>Jehovah will ransom them from the power of Sheol; He will redeem them from death (v. 14a). Hence, the next part of the verse says, &ldquo;Where are your plagues, O death? / Where is your destruction, O Sheol?&rdquo; Repentance will be hidden from His eyes (v. 14c). God&rsquo;s love for Israel is everlasting, and He will never repent of this love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. Jehovah through His Prophet Calling Israel<br />
to Return to Him Their God</h2>
<p>Israel had fallen by their iniquity, and Jehovah through His prophet called them to return to Him their God (14:1). They should take words with them, return to Jehovah, and say to Him, &ldquo;Forgive all iniquity, / And take us graciously; / Thus we will render our lips as bullocks. / Assyria will not save us; / We will not ride upon horses. / Neither will we say again to the work of our hands, Our God! / Because in You the orphan finds compassion&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). With their lips they would offer sacrifices and offerings to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">L. Israel in the Restoration</h2>
<p>In verses 4 through 8 we have a picture of Israel in the restoration (Matt. 19:28), as revealed in Hosea 2:15-23; 3:5; 6:1-3; 10:12. Jehovah will heal their apostasy; He will love them freely, for His anger will have turned away from them. He will be like the dew to Israel. Israel will bud like the lily (signifying a pure life trusting in God) and will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon (signifying standing steadily in the uplifted humanity). His shoots will go forth (signifying flourishing and spreading); his splendor will be like that of the olive tree (signifying glory in faithfulness); and his fragrance will be like that of the trees of Lebanon (signifying the sweet odor of a life in the uplifted humanity). Those who sit under his shade (signifying being overshadowed by the sufficient grace enjoyed by them&mdash;2 Cor. 12:9) will return. They will revive like grain (signifying being full of life for producing the satisfying food) and will bud like the vine (signifying blossoming for producing the cheering drink). Israel&rsquo;s renown will be like the wine of Lebanon (signifying a good name spreading like tasteful wine).</p>
<p>I hope that this will be the situation with all the local churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Then instead of being an unturned cake or a silly dove or a deceitful bow, we will be like lilies, trees of Lebanon, olive trees, and budding vines.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s transformation as described in Hosea 14:4-7 is based on the factor of love in life. Love in affection does not transform, but love in life transforms people. A husband who loves his wife in affection may spoil her, but a father who loves his son in life never spoils his son. As a son grows, he is transformed. Our relationship with God is of the divine, eternal life of God. This life enlivens us, regenerates us, sanctifies us positionally and dispositionally, renews us, transforms us, conforms us, matures us, and glorifies us, making us the same as God in life, nature, appearance, and glory.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Hosea, Israel was a harlot, but at the end of this book, Israel has become a son. Eventually, Ephraim declares that he has no more idols. &ldquo;Ephraim says, What have I yet to do with idols?&rdquo; (v. 8a). God answers by saying, &ldquo;(I respond and look on him.) / I am like a green fir tree; / From Me your fruit is found&rdquo; (v. 8b). Jehovah&rsquo;s being like a green fir tree (symbolizing God&rsquo;s being living and evergreen) and Ephraim&rsquo;s bearing fruit from Him indicates Ephraim&rsquo;s oneness with Jehovah. It also indicates that a wonderful transformation has taken place, based on the factor of love in life. Today God is the evergreen tree, and we, the believers in Christ, are the branches of the tree, bearing fruit out of Him. This is more than an organic union; it is the oneness of two in one life, in one nature, and in one living. The outcome of this book is transformation in life by God&rsquo;s love. This is the revelation in chapter fourteen of Hosea, and we all need to see it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE PROPHET&rsquo;S WORD BEING WISE</h2>
<p>Verse 9 says that the prophet&rsquo;s word is wise, showing us that the ways of Jehovah are right. The righteous will walk in them, but the transgressors will stumble in them.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HOSEA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(8)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE IMPLICATIONS CONCERNING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 11:1-4</h1>
<p>The book of Hosea is very rich. Many of the riches in this book are not directly stated but rather are implied by Hosea&rsquo;s poetic writing. Thus, we need to study the implications of the poetic writing in this book. It is not easy to know the significance of these implications. In this message I have the burden to give a brief word on three implications concerning Christ in 11:1-4. The three matters in these verses that imply Christ are God&rsquo;s calling His son out of Egypt, His drawing Israel with the cords of a man, and His gently causing them to eat.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD,<br />
BEING CALLED OUT OF EGYPT BY GOD</h2>
<p>Hosea 11:1 says, &ldquo;When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.&rdquo; This verse implies Christ in His union with Israel as the Son of God and as the One called out of Egypt by God. The fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ in this verse is in Matthew 2:15, which speaks of Christ&rsquo;s being called out of Egypt by God. Thus, Hosea 11:1 implies Christ as the Son of God.</p>
<p>A further implication of this verse is that with Christ we, the believers in Christ, are also sons of God (Heb. 2:10). In Christ we are sons of God. Apart from Christ we cannot be sons of God. Our sonship (Eph. 1:5) is altogether in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son</h2>
<p>Regarding Christ as the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of His being the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of His being the firstborn Son of God. In eternity, Christ was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son (John 1:18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). Christ was the unique Son of God. Besides Him there were no other sons of God. How, then, can there be the many sons of God? To answer this question we need to consider Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. One day Christ, the only begotten Son of God in eternity, was incarnated to be a man. On the cross He died an all-inclusive, vicarious death, and then He entered into resurrection. In resurrection and through resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God. As the only begotten Son of God in eternity, Christ did not have humanity; He only had divinity. Therefore, before His resurrection He was the Son of God only in His divinity. That was unique. But by His incarnation He entered into humanity and took on human nature as part of His being. However, He was not designated the Son of God in His humanity (Rom. 1:4) until His resurrection. This is the reason that Paul says in Acts 13:33, &ldquo;God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, &lsquo;You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&rsquo;&rdquo; This verse indicates that resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus. He was begotten of God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). This means that, in addition to His being the unique, only begotten Son of God from eternity, Christ, after incarnation and through resurrection, was begotten of God in His humanity to become the Son of God in another sense, in the sense of being the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Many Sons</h2>
<p>The word &ldquo;Firstborn&rdquo; in Romans 8:29 and Hebrews 1:6 indicates that God has many sons. Without the many sons Christ could not be the firstborn Son; He could only be the only begotten Son. In order for Christ to be the firstborn Son, there must be other sons. These other sons were also born in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). This means that in His resurrection not only was Christ born to be the firstborn Son of God, but also in His resurrection we were regenerated and born to be the many sons of God, His many brothers, to be His members for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ. All this is implied in Hosea 11:1. How rich are the implications in this verse!</p>
<h2 class="head1">CORDS OF A MAN, BANDS OF LOVE</h2>
<p>Hosea 11:4a says, &ldquo;I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s love is divine, but His love reaches us in the cords of a man.</p>
<p>It is important for us to realize that this verse does not speak of a <em>cord</em> but of <em>cords</em>. These cords include Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This means that the cords mentioned in this verse have different segments and that each segment involves Christ&rsquo;s humanity. First, God was incarnated; He came to be a man named Jesus. Incarnation, therefore, is the first segment of the cords of a man. The Lord Jesus lived among us on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and His human living is the second segment of these cords. Eventually, He was crucified, dying on the cross for us, and then He was resurrected. His crucifixion and resurrection are also segments of the cords of a man. It is with such cords that God has drawn us.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that every segment, every part, of the cords of a man involves Christ&rsquo;s humanity. After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens in His humanity. This was the reason Stephen could see the ascended One as the Son of Man and testify, saying, &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo; (Acts 7:56). When Christ comes back, He will come in His humanity. The Lord&rsquo;s word to the high priest in Matthew 26:64 reveals this. &ldquo;From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&rdquo; The cords of a man, therefore, involve Christ&rsquo;s humanity in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>In Hosea 11:4a &ldquo;cords of a man&rdquo; and &ldquo;bands of love&rdquo; are in apposition. Hence, the words &ldquo;cords&rdquo; and &ldquo;bands&rdquo; refer to the same thing. The bands of love are the cords of a man. The love of God, the divine love, comes to us through Christ&rsquo;s humanity. For this reason, the bands of love are the cords of a man. Here Christ is revealed not directly but by the way of implication. What a rich, deep, marvelous, and mysterious implication concerning Christ we have here!</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s everlasting love, His unchanging, subduing love, is altogether in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ. Apart from Christ God&rsquo;s everlasting love could not be prevailing. God&rsquo;s unchanging love is prevailing because it is a love in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ. If Christ had not been incarnated, if Christ had not lived on earth, if Christ had not died a vicarious death for us, if Christ had not entered into resurrection and then ascended to the heavens, there would be no way for God to draw us with cords of a man, with bands of love.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all for us, for it is by all these steps of Christ&rsquo;s humanity that God&rsquo;s love in His salvation reaches us. These steps are the cords of a man, the bands of love, with which God has drawn us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD GENTLY CAUSING US TO EAT</h2>
<p>A third implication concerning Christ is found in Hosea 11:4b. Here Jehovah says, &ldquo;I was to them like those / Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; / And I gently caused them to eat.&rdquo; When did God do this? During the forty years the children of Israel were in the wilderness, God gently and patiently fed them with manna. Manna is a type of Christ as our heavenly food. Hence, this word concerning God&rsquo;s gently causing them to eat also implies Christ.</p>
<p>When we were saved, God drew us with cords of a man, with bands of love, and now He is feeding us with Christ. I can testify that from the time I was saved God has been gently and patiently feeding me with Christ. Sometimes we may want to eat too much or eat in haste, but God wants us to eat slowly and gently with patience and endurance. This is the way God feeds us.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<p>The object of Joel&rsquo;s ministry was the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Place of Joel&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of Joel&rsquo;s ministry was also Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the book of Joel is the devastation of the human government on Israel in four stages and the destruction of Christ over the devastators and His reign among Israel in the restoration (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 19:28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Joel is that the nations, as the locusts, devastate Israel consecutively in four empires, from Nebuchadnezzar, the first king of Babylon, to Antichrist, the last Caesar of Rome; they will be overcome and terminated by Christ, who will set up the kingdom and reign among the saved Israel in the age of restoration. The four empires that devastate Israel and that will be overcome and terminated by Christ are the Babylonian Empire, the Medo-Persian Empire, the Macedonian-Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. These four empires are signified by the great human image in Daniel 2, an image that will be destroyed by Christ as the stone cut out without hands (vv. 34-35). Actually, this stone signifies not merely the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ. The corporate Christ will come as a stone cut out without hands and will smite the human government into pieces.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. In His Coming with His Overcomers<br />
as the Mighty Ones<br />
to Defeat Antichrist and His Army</h2>
<p>In the book of Joel Christ is revealed in His coming with His overcomers as the mighty ones to defeat Antichrist and his army (Joel 3:11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In His Judgment of the Nations</h2>
<p>In this book Christ is revealed also in His judgment of the nations (3:2a, 12, 14). This is the judgment of the living (Matt. 25:31-46; Acts 10:42; 17:31). Acts 10:42 tells us that Christ is the One who has been designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead, and 17:31 says that God &ldquo;has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated.&rdquo; Christ will judge the living just before the millennium and He will judge the dead after the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. In His Dwelling in the Holy Mountain of Zion<br />
within Jerusalem to Reign among Israel</h2>
<p>Finally, in Joel Christ is revealed in His dwelling in the holy mountain of Zion within Jerusalem to reign among Israel to be their God, their shelter, and their stronghold (Joel 3:16-17, 21b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Joel has five sections: the introduction (1:1), the plague of the locusts (1:2&mdash;2:11), the turn of Jehovah to His elect, Israel (2:12-32), the judgment of Christ upon the nations (3:1-15), and the victory of Christ over the nations and His reign among Israel (3:11, 16-21).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE DAY OF JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>The book of Joel speaks of the day of Jehovah (1:15; 2:1, 11, 31; 3:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Day of Jehovah in Joel<br />
Being the Day of the Lord in the New Testament</h2>
<p>The day of Jehovah in the book of Joel is the day of the Lord in the New Testament (2 Pet. 3:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Lord&rsquo;s Judgment<br />
for His Governmental Dealing</h2>
<p>In expressions such as &ldquo;the day of Jehovah&rdquo; and &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo; the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; is used mainly in the sense of the Lord&rsquo;s judgment for His governmental dealing (Ezek. 13:5; 30:3; Zeph. 1:8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Day of the Lord<br />
Being the Day in Which the Lord Judges</h2>
<p>Before the Lord comes, it is &ldquo;man&rsquo;s day,&rdquo; in which man judges (1 Cor. 4:3-5). Man will continue to judge until the Lord comes. After the Lord comes, it will be &ldquo;the day of the Lord,&rdquo; in which the Lord judges. Man&rsquo;s day of judgment is the present age. This is in contrast to the Lord&rsquo;s day, which is the coming age, the kingdom age, in which the judgment will be the Lord&rsquo;s judgment. Today in the day of man, everyone is a judge. Even children judge their parents, and students judge their teachers. But in the day of the Lord, the Lord will stop all human judging and will give the final word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Final Day of Jehovah (the Lord)<br />
Beginning at the Sixth Seal<br />
and Ending at the Judgment<br />
of the Great White Throne</h2>
<p>The final day of Jehovah (the Lord) will begin at the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12-17), end at the judgment of the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15), and comprise various calamities, plagues, and woes for the Lord&rsquo;s punishing judgments and governmental dealings upon the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, men, Satan, and the demons to clear up the earth and the entire universe, for the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1) to come for His eternal kingdom. The time from the sixth seal to the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom will be a little more than three and a half years. That will be the time mainly of the great tribulation. The judgment of the great white throne will take place after the thousand-year kingdom. Thus, the day of the Lord will last for about one thousand three and a half years.</p>
<p>Let us now briefly consider the calamities, plagues, and woes which the day of the Lord will comprise.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Natural Calamities of the Sixth Seal</h2>
<p>First, there will be the natural calamities of the sixth seal upon the sun, the moon, the stars, the heavens, and the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Severer Calamities<br />
of the First Four Trumpets</h2>
<p>Revelation 8:7-12 speaks of the severer calamities of the first four trumpets upon the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars. Actually, the calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets are a cluster related to the judgment of the universe.</p>
 <h2 class="head3">3. The First Woe, the Fifth Trumpet</h2>
<p>The first woe, the fifth trumpet, will be by the locusts from the abyss under Antichrist as their king, who will also come out from the abyss (Rev. 9:1-11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Second Woe, the Sixth Trumpet</h2>
<p>The second woe, the sixth trumpet, will be by the four angels released from the Euphrates with the two hundred million horsemen (Rev. 9:12-19).</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Third Woe, the Seventh Trumpet</h2>
<p>The third woe, the seventh trumpet, will be composed of the seven bowls (Rev. 11:14-15a; 15:1, 5-8; 16:1).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Evil and Malignant Sore of the First Bowl</h2>
<p>The evil and malignant sore of the first bowl will be upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image (Rev. 16:2).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In the Second Bowl the Sea<br />
Becoming Blood like That of a Dead Man</h2>
<p>In the second bowl the sea will become blood like that of a dead man, and every living soul that is in the sea will die (Rev. 16:3).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In the Third Bowl<br />
the Rivers and Springs Becoming Blood</h2>
<p>In the third bowl the rivers and springs will become blood to be the drink of those who pour out the blood of the saints and the prophets (Rev. 16:4-7).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. In the Fourth Bowl the Sun Burning Men with Fire</h2>
<p>In the fourth bowl the sun will burn men with fire (Rev. 16:8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. In the Fifth Bowl<br />
the Kingdom of Antichrist Becoming Darkened</h2>
<p>In the fifth bowl the kingdom of Antichrist will become darkened, and people will gnaw their tongues for pain and will blaspheme the God of heaven for their pains and sores (Rev. 16:10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. In the Sixth Bowl There Being<br />
the War of Armageddon</h2>
<p>In the sixth bowl there will be the war of Armageddon, in which Antichrist and his armies will fight against Christ with His overcomers. Christ will destroy Antichrist and all his evil armies, and Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 16:12-16; 17:14; 19:19-21). In Revelation 14:17-20 Christ&rsquo;s defeating Antichrist and all his evil armies is likened to His treading of the great winepress of the fury of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. The Unprecedented Earthquake of the Seventh Bowl</h2>
<p>In the seventh bowl there will be an unprecedented earthquake. The great city of Jerusalem will be divided into three parts, the cities of the nations will fall, and political Babylon will be destroyed under God&rsquo;s wrath. Every island will flee, and the mountains will disappear. Furthermore, great hail will come out of heaven upon men (Rev. 16:17-21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. All the Calamities, Plagues, and Woes<br />
from the Sixth Seal to the Seventh Bowl<br />
Constituting the Great Tribulation,<br />
the Hour of Trial</h2>
<p>All the calamities, plagues, and woes from the sixth seal to the seventh bowl constitute the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), the hour of trial to try all the people who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3:10). The great tribulation will last for three and a half years (Rev. 11:2; 12:14; 13:5; 12:6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Religious Babylon the Great Being Destroyed</h2>
<p>Probably at the beginning of the great tribulation, the religious Babylon the Great, the Roman Catholic Church, will be destroyed by Antichrist (Rev. 14:8; 17:16). At the end of the great tribulation, the political Babylon the Great, the revived Roman Empire, will be destroyed by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Two Witnesses</h2>
<p>In the great tribulation the two witnesses will spit fire out of their mouth to devour their enemies, will shut up the heavens from raining, will have authority to turn the waters into blood, and will smite the earth with every plague (Rev. 11:3-6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Antichrist Blaspheming God<br />
and Making War with the Saints and Overcoming Them</h2>
<p>In the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Antichrist, instigated by Satan and strengthened by the false prophet, will blaspheme God and make war with the saints and overcome them. Satanic authority will be given to him over every tribe and nation (Rev. 13:4-7; 12:13-17; 2 Thes. 2:3b-4; Dan. 11:36-39; Matt. 24:15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Satan Being Bound for a Thousand Years<br />
and Cast into the Abyss</h2>
<p>Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:1-3). This will take place after Christ deals with Antichrist and his armies.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Christ Ruling the Nations<br />
with an Iron Rod for One Thousand Years</h2>
<p>Christ will rule the nations with an iron rod for one thousand years and will break them in pieces as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces (Rev. 2:27).</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. The Burning of the Rebellious People<br />
and the Casting of the Devil into the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>At the end of the millennium, the nations, deceived by the devil, will rebel against Christ, but fire will come down out of heaven and devour them. Then the devil will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. The Judgment of the Great White Throne</h2>
<p>At the end of the day of the Lord, there will be the judgment of the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15) by Christ over the dead men, the demons, and probably the fallen angels (2 Pet. 2:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Heavens and the Earth Being Renewed</h2>
<p>Finally, the heavens and the earth will be renewed with intense burning heat to be the new heavens and the new earth for the New Jerusalem (2 Pet. 3:10-13; Rev. 21:1-2). The day of the Lord ends with this burning heat. The heavens and the earth, the old creation, have been polluted and contaminated by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and by man&rsquo;s fall and therefore need to be renewed.</p>
<p>The day of the Lord with all of its judgments is for the manifestation of Christ. As we study the Bible, we need to realize that revelation in the Bible is centered on Christ, who is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy. All the judgments of the day of the Lord, including all the calamities, plagues, and woes, have a goal, and this goal is to bring in the manifestation of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON JOEL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CONTENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Joel 1:2&mdash;2:11</h1>
<p>The book of Joel contains three main points. The first main point is the plague of the four kinds of locusts (the nations) or of one kind of locust in four stages. The second main point is the outpouring of the consummated Spirit. This outpouring initiated the church life, which is the content of the age of mystery. The third main point is the restoration not only of Israel but of the entire universe. This restoration will consummate in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem. In this message we will consider the first of these three main points.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PLAGUE OF THE LOCUSTS (THE NATIONS)</h2>
<p>The plague of the locusts (the nations) is covered in 1:2&mdash;2:11.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Seriousness of the Prophecy</h2>
<p>Joel 1:2-4 shows us the seriousness of the prophecy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. A Message for the Elders among the People<br />
and for All the Inhabitants of the Land</h2>
<p>The elders among the people should hear this message, and all the inhabitants of the land should give heed to it. They should tell their children about it, their children should tell their children, and their children should tell the next generation (vv. 2-3; Psa. 78:6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Cutting Locust, the Swarming Locust,<br />
the Licking Locust, and the Consuming Locust</h2>
<p>Joel 1:4 says that what the cutting locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; and what the swarming locust has left, the licking locust has eaten; and what the licking locust has left, the consuming locust has eaten. Four words for locust are used in this verse, probably referring to one kind of locust in various stages of growth. As we will see, this one kind of locust in four stages corresponds to the four sections of the great human image in Daniel 2, to the four beasts in Daniel 7, and to the four horns in Zechariah 1. The cutting locust refers to the Babylonian Empire; the swarming locust, to the Medo-Persian Empire; the licking locust, to the Grecian Empire; and the consuming locust, to the Roman Empire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Coming Up of a Nation,<br />
Mighty and without Number,<br />
against the Land of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Joel 1:6a speaks of the coming up of a nation, mighty and without number, against the land of Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Likened to One Kind of Locust in Four Stages</h2>
<p>The coming of such a nation is likened to one kind of locust in four stages: the cutting locust, the swarming locust, the licking locust, and the consuming locust (v. 4; 2:2, 4-11). The four successive kinds of locusts refer to the nations which devastated Israel in four consecutive empires: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Further Likened<br />
to the Great Human Image in Four Sections</h2>
<p>This mighty nation is further likened to the great human image in four sections: the golden head&mdash;Babylon; the silver breast and arms&mdash;Medo-Persia; the bronze abdomen and thighs&mdash;Greece; and the iron legs with the feet&mdash;Rome (Dan. 2:31-33).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Further Likened to Four Beasts</h2>
<p>The coming up of a nation, mighty and without number, is further likened to four beasts: a lion, a bear, a leopard, and the one who is the totality of the first three (Dan. 7:2-8; Rev. 13:2a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Likened Ultimately to Four Horns</h2>
<p>This nation is likened ultimately to four horns (Zech. 1:18-21). The four horns, the four beasts, the four sections of the great image, and the four kinds of locusts all refer to the same four empires. Throughout human history, in God&rsquo;s dealing with Israel and in God&rsquo;s punishment upon the Gentiles, these four empires have been and still are the center.</p><h2 class="head3">5. To Devastate the Land of Jehovah</h2>
<p>The nation mentioned in Joel 1:6a came to devastate the land of Jehovah, devouring and breaking the people into pieces and making the land a desolation (vv. 6b-7a; 2:3; Dan. 7:7; Isa. 10:3; Jer. 25:11). Because of this desolation, there were no food to feed the people and no wine to cheer the people (Joel 1:5, 7, 10-12, 16a, 17), no meal offering and no drink offering for the priests to offer to God in His temple (vv. 9, 13, 16b), and no pasture for the beasts, herds of cattle, and herds of sheep (vv. 18-20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. From Nebuchadnezzar,<br />
the First King of the Babylonian Empire,<br />
to the Last Caesar of the Roman Empire</h2>
<p>The empires that have devastated the land of Jehovah include the empires from Nebuchadnezzar, the first king of the Babylonian Empire, through the Medo-Persian Empire and the Macedonian and Grecian Empire, to the last Caesar (Antichrist) of the Roman Empire (Dan. 7:2-8; 8:3-14; 11:2-45; Rev. 13:1-18; 17:11-14; 19:19-21). Babylon actually began with Babel, which was founded by Nimrod (Gen. 10:8-10), the first type of Antichrist.</p>
<p>The Bible likens these four empires to locusts. A plague of locusts is terrible. In just one day an entire harvest can be consumed; nothing can stop the devouring locusts. The armies of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome were like locusts coming to devastate Israel totally, devouring their people, land, fields, produce, food, and drink and cutting off their offerings.</p>
<p>Apparently, these four empires are human like the great human image representing the totality of human government. However, in the sight of God they are beasts. Babylon is the lion; Medo-Persia is the bear; Greece is the leopard; and Rome, being the totality of the first three, is the most wild and devastating beast of all. Ultimately, these four empires are four horns used by Satan to devastate God&rsquo;s chosen people. The prophecies concerning this are now history.</p>
<p>Daniel 7:12 says, &ldquo;As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a season and a time.&rdquo; This indicates that as each empire was defeated, although its dominion was taken away, its culture was adopted by each succeeding empire. Thus each empire continued to live. The culture of Babylon was adopted by Medo-Persia; the culture of Medo-Persia was adopted by Greece; and the culture of Greece was adopted by Rome. From this we see that the Roman Empire inherited the cultures of the three foregoing empires. The dominion of the Roman Empire is over, but its &ldquo;life,&rdquo; its culture, continues. In a sense, we all are Roman citizens, for we are under the influence of the spirit of the Roman Empire, especially in the matters of politics and law. Today the world&rsquo;s culture is Roman, yet, being an accumulated culture, it contains the cultures of the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks.</p>
<p>The Bible covers four things: God&rsquo;s chastisement on His elect people, God&rsquo;s punishment of the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration. These four matters are covered in Joel, a short book of three chapters. First, God sent the locusts to devastate Israel. This was His chastisement for Israel&rsquo;s great evils. Second, this book reveals that God will punish and judge the Gentile nations. Third, Joel speaks concerning the outpouring of the processed, consummated, compound Spirit, the Spirit of God compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death and its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power. This is the Holy Spirit who was poured out on the day of Pentecost, and this Spirit is the consummated Christ for the manifestation of Christ. This manifestation began with the incarnation of Christ and has been confirmed and strengthened by the outpouring of the Spirit because, through that outpouring, the individual Christ became the corporate Christ, initiating the church life and the church age. The church is the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:15-16). Hence, we are the manifestation of Christ. Now we are awaiting the fourth matter revealed in the book of Joel&mdash;the glorious day of restoration, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. This is the revelation of the Bible, and this is the history of the universe.</p>
<p>The four empires signified by the locusts are very worldly, but they are used by God&rsquo;s Craftsman (Christ&mdash;Dan. 2:34-35) as His instrument to chastise Israel and punish the nations. In this way God is accomplishing whatever is needed for Christ to be manifested in full, that the entire universe may be fully restored.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON JOEL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CONTENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Joel 2:12&mdash;3:21</h1>
<p>Joel is a short book of three chapters, but it covers human history from 606 B.C. to the millennium. A major revelation in Joel is that God has raised up four empires symbolized by four kinds of locusts, beginning with Babylon and continuing with Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire, to devastate the one small nation of Israel, God&rsquo;s elect. Today this devastation is still going on. Along the way, while such a history was proceeding, God poured out Himself as the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One, the processed and consummated Triune God as the Spirit, upon the believers of Christ. That outpouring produced the church and began the age of mystery. Everything concerning the church is a mystery, and this mystery is the manifestation of Christ. Now we are here in the church doing things in a mysterious way to usher in the final appearing of Christ to bring in the age of restoration, the thousand-year kingdom, which is the prelude to the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. This is the revelation in the book of Joel.</p>
<p>Let us now go on to consider further the content of Joel in 2:12&mdash;3:21. In this portion we have the turn of Jehovah to His elect, Israel (2:12-32), the judgment of Christ upon the nations (3:1-15), and the victory of Christ with His overcomers over the nations and His reign among Israel in the age of restoration (3:9-13, 16-21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE TURN OF JEHOVAH TO HIS ELECT, ISRAEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Wanting Them to Turn<br />
to Jehovah Their God</h2>
<p>Jehovah wanted His elect to turn to Him. Verses 12 through 17 of chapter two reveal in what way they should return to their God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. With All Their Heart</h2>
<p>Jehovah wanted His elect to turn to Him with all their heart (v. 12a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. With Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning</h2>
<p>He wanted them to turn to Him also with fasting, weeping, and mourning (v. 12b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Rending Their Hearts<br />
and Not Their Garments</h2>
<p>In returning to their God, Jehovah&rsquo;s elect should rend their hearts and not their garments (v. 13). They should do this so that God would turn, repent, and leave a blessing behind Him&mdash;a meal offering and a drink offering (v. 14).</p>
<p>The meal offering and the drink offering are blessings to Israel. When Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, Israel lost the place appointed by God where they could offer their offerings to God (Deut. 12:5-6). Also, God&rsquo;s army of locusts destroyed the produce of the land, leaving no grain to make a meal offering and no grapes to make wine for the drink offering. Thus, Israel lost both the ground and the materials to offer the meal offering to feed God and the drink offering to cheer God. Today both God and Israel are still suffering the loss of this blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Blowing a Trumpet in Zion</h2>
<p>In Joel 2:15a Jehovah says, &ldquo;Blow a trumpet in Zion.&rdquo; To blow a trumpet is to make a declaration in a triumphant spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Sanctifying a Fast</h2>
<p>Verse 15b goes on to say, &ldquo;Sanctify a fast.&rdquo; This fast was not to be common; rather, it was to be sanctified, separated for God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Calling a Solemn Assembly</h2>
<p>Jehovah also wanted His elect to call a solemn assembly: gathering the people, assembling the elders, and letting the bridegroom go forth from his chamber and the bride from her canopy (vv. 15c-16). Such an assembly is a great blessing, something that should not be missed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Letting the Priests Weep<br />
between the Porch and the Altar</h2>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, / Weep between the porch and the altar, / And let them say, / Look with pity, O Jehovah, upon Your people; / And do not give Your inheritance over to reproach, / That the nations should rule over them. / Why should they say among the nations, / Where is their God?&rdquo; The porch and the altar were outside the temple, and between the porch and the altar the priests were to weep for Israel&rsquo;s having lost the blessing. Nevertheless, the people, having been brought back to God, had the ground to enjoy the blessing. They had the altar, ordained by God, where they could offer what God desired for His satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Desiring to Bless His Own Land</h2>
<p>In verses 18 through 27 we see that God desires to bless His own land. The holy land, a particular area of land, is God&rsquo;s land.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. With the Rich Produce of the Land</h2>
<p>God desires to bless His own land with the rich produce of the land (vv. 19, 21-22, 25-27).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. By the Rains</h2>
<p>God desires to bless His land also by the rains: the former rain and the latter rain (v. 23).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. By Driving Away from the People<br />
the Enemies Sent by God as His Great Army</h2>
<p>Finally, God desires to bless His land by driving away from the peoples the enemies sent by Him as the swarming locusts, the licking locusts, the consuming locusts, and the cutting locusts as His great army (vv. 20, 25).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Willing to Save Them</h2>
<p>Verses 28 through 32 reveal that God is willing to save His elect, Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. By Pouring Out His Spirit upon Them</h2>
<p>Jehovah is willing to save Israel by pouring out His Spirit (as the former rain) upon them (vv. 28-29). This prophecy was fulfilled as a foretaste on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 16-21), and it will be fulfilled as a full taste before the great tribulation for the salvation and regeneration of many of the returned Israelites. This outpouring is different from the outpouring of the Spirit on the last day of the tribulation (Zech. 12:10) for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews under Antichrist&rsquo;s besieging.</p>
<p>The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the Spirit of God compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension. This compounded Spirit who has been poured out is the realization of Christ and the consummation of the Triune God. God poured Himself upon those who called on the name of the Lord. This outpouring produced the church. Formerly, there were only the Jews and the Gentiles, but now there is the church as a third entity (1 Cor. 10:32). The church is mysterious, for it is in the church that Christ is manifested.</p>
<p>The outpouring of the consummated Spirit is Christ&rsquo;s coming. Christ came through incarnation. Eventually, He died and was resurrected, and, in a sense, He went away. But by the outpouring of the Spirit He came back to be manifested. By this outpouring all the disciples and saved ones on the day of Pentecost became parts of the corporate Christ. The individual Christ has thus become the corporate Christ, the enlarged, increased Christ, which is the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:15-16).</p>
<p>From what we have covered so far in this life-study of Joel, we can see that this book deals with world history. Our text for the study of history is the Bible, in particular the short book of Joel. In this book we see the nations as the locusts and the devastation of Israel by these locusts. Here we also see a great outpouring of the Spirit as the consummated Triune God upon those Jews who call upon the name of Jehovah and who thus are regenerated to become part of the church for the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Through Their Calling on the Name of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Joel 2:32 indicates that God&rsquo;s elect people will be saved through their calling on the name of Jehovah. The equivalent of this in the New Testament is calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Accompanied by the Natural Calamities<br />
of the Sixth Seal and the First Four Trumpets</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s saving of Israel by pouring out His Spirit upon them will be accompanied by the natural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets (Rev. 6:12-17; 8:7-12) on the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth (Joel 2:30-31a) as a prelude to the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Before the Fifth Trumpet,<br />
the First of the Three Woes</h2>
<p>The second outpouring of the Spirit for the saving of the returned Jews will take place before the fifth trumpet, the first of the three woes (Rev. 8:13&mdash;9:19; 11:14; 15:5&mdash;16:21), which are the major structure of the great tribulation, in the great and terrible day of Jehovah (Joel 2:31b). However, many of the returned Jews will not believe but will continue to be stubborn. Eventually, during the tribulation, Jerusalem will be surrounded by the Gentile armies under Antichrist, whose intention will be to destroy Israel entirely. At that juncture the Lord Jesus Christ will descend with His overcomers. Furthermore, according to Zechariah 12, at that time the consummated Spirit will again be poured out, and the remnant of the children of Israel will be saved.</p>
<p>Thus, there are three outpourings of the Holy Spirit: first, the outpouring on the day of Pentecost; second, the outpouring just before the great tribulation upon the Jews; and third, the outpouring upon the besieged Jews, who will have no way to escape the persecution of Antichrist. These three outpourings work together for the salvation of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE JUDGMENT OF CHRIST UPON THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>Joel 3:1-15 speaks concerning the judgment of Christ upon the nations&mdash;the judgment upon the living (Acts 10:42; 17:31).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. At the Valley of Jehoshaphat</h2>
<p>This judgment will take place at the valley of Jehoshaphat, which is the valley of decision (Joel 3:2, 12, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To Recompense the Nations&rsquo; Mistreatment<br />
of Israel during the Great Tribulation</h2>
<p>The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s judgment upon the living will be to recompense the nations&rsquo; mistreatment of Israel during the great tribulation (vv. 2b-8; Rev. 12:17; 13:7, 10; Matt. 25:41-46a). After Christ casts Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire, He will set up His throne in Jerusalem, and all the living ones as the goats and the sheep will be gathered before Him to be judged by Him. The goats will be the evil ones, those who persecuted the Jews, and the sheep will be the good ones, those who helped the persecuted Jews during the tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE VICTORY OF CHRIST WITH HIS OVERCOMERS OVER THE NATIONS AND HIS REIGN AMONG ISRAEL<br />
IN THE AGE OF RESTORATION</h2>
<p>Finally, Joel speaks regarding the victory of Christ with His overcomers over the nations and His reign among Israel in the age of restoration (3:9-13, 16-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ with His Overcomers<br />
Defeating Antichrist and His Armies<br />
at Armageddon</h2>
<p>First, according to verses 9 through 13, Christ with His overcomers (Rev. 17:14; 19:11-14) as the mighty ones will defeat Antichrist and his armies (the nations) at Armageddon.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ Reigning among Israel<br />
on the Holy Mountain of Zion within Jerusalem</h2>
<p>After the defeat of Antichrist, Christ will reign among Israel on the holy mountain of Zion within Jerusalem (Joel 3:16a, 17, 21b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Christ Being a Shelter and a Stronghold<br />
to the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>As Christ reigns in Jerusalem, He will be a shelter and a stronghold to the children of Israel (v. 16b). Because of this, no one will be able to damage Israel anymore.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. In the Restoration</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s reign among Israel on the holy mountain of Zion within Jerusalem will be in the restoration (v. 18; Matt. 19:28).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Mountains Dropping Down Fresh Wine<br />
and the Hills Flowing with Milk</h2>
<p>Joel 3:18a tells us that in the restoration the mountains will drop down fresh wine, and the hills will flow with milk. This indicates how rich the situation will be.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. All the Waterways of Judah Flowing with Water</h2>
<p>In the restoration there will be no shortage of water, for all the waterways of Judah will flow with water (v. 18b). Wherever there is a waterway, there will be a river full of water.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. A Fountain Going Forth<br />
from the House of Jehovah to Water the Land</h2>
<p>A fountain will go forth from the house of Jehovah, the temple, to water the entire holy land (v. 18c). This points to the situation in the New Jerusalem, where a river will flow out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to water the holy city.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. All the Surrounding Enemies of Israel<br />
Being Punished</h2>
<p>Joel 3:19-21a tells us that all the surrounding enemies of Israel will be punished. Therefore, the nations will be punished, Israel will be restored, and Christ will be manifested. This will be a prelude to the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<h1 class="title">ON JOEL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CONTROLLING PROPHECY<br />
OF THE FOUR LOCUSTS IN THE BOOK OF JOEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-32; 3:9-21</h1>
<p>In this message I have the burden to give a further word on the prophecy concerning the four kinds of locusts in the book of Joel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DANIEL AND JOEL</h2>
<p>In the interpretation of the prophecies of the Bible, Joel&rsquo;s prophecy is more controlling than Daniel&rsquo;s. It is true to say that Daniel&rsquo;s prophecy is the controlling factor for us to understand and interpret the prophecies in the Bible. However, the controlling factors in Daniel are on the surface, whereas the factors in Joel are hidden, concealed, in a mysterious way. For this reason, if we would understand the book of Joel, we must have insight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR KINDS OF LOCUSTS DENOTING<br />
THE FOUR SECTIONS OF HUMAN GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>The first factor in Joel is the locusts in four stages: the cutting locust, symbolizing Babylon; the swarming locust, symbolizing Medo-Persia; the licking locust, symbolizing Greece; and the consuming locust, symbolizing the Roman Empire (1:4). These four kinds of locusts denote the four sections of the entire human government on earth signified by the great human image in Daniel 2. After these four sections of human government, which will end with Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, human government will be brought to an end.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR KINDS OF LOCUSTS<br />
CONSUMING THE NATION OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>These four kinds of locusts are related to the small nation of Israel. In a sense, God sent the four sections of the human government as locusts to consume Israel.</p>
<p>The four kinds of locusts, corresponding to the four sections of human government, will occupy a long period of time in human history, from the time of Nebuchadnezzar to the time of Antichrist. This period will last for at least twenty-seven centuries. Between the times of Nebuchadnezzar and Antichrist, there will be a long time in which the Jews will have no nation, no kings, no priests, no prophets, and no temple as the God-ordained center where they can worship God. Today the Jews are still being consumed by the locusts of the human, Gentile government.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THROUGH THE ROMAN LOCUSTS<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION AND THE PREACHING<br />
OF THE GOSPEL BEING CARRIED OUT</h2>
<p>The final stage of God&rsquo;s sending of the locusts is the Roman Empire. While the Roman Empire was chastising rebellious Israel, God did something silently and mysteriously. God used the Roman Empire to keep the region around the Mediterranean Sea&mdash;the center of human habitation&mdash;in a peaceful order. Highways were built, shipping routes were established on the sea, and a common language, Greek, was spoken by all the peoples. It was at that time that God came to be incarnated by being born of a virgin in a small city, Bethlehem, and eventually lived in Nazareth. For thirty-three and a half years the God of everlasting love lived on the earth in His humanity as a man. After this He went to the cross and died the death of a criminal under the Roman form of capital punishment. Although the worldlings did not realize it, Christ died a vicarious, all-inclusive death. After three days He resurrected. On the same day, in the morning of His resurrection, He ascended to the Father and descended again to the earth to meet with His disciples. Forty days later, in the presence of His disciples, He ascended to the heavens. After ten more days, on the day of Pentecost, He came down again by being poured out as the Spirit upon three thousand of His believers, making each of the three thousand the same as He is in life and nature. The issue of that outpouring of the Spirit was a corporate Christ, which is the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<p>From this we see that it was through the Roman locusts that both God&rsquo;s redemption and the preaching of the gospel were carried out. First, the gospel was spread throughout the Roman Empire and then, as a result of Roman imperialism, to other parts of the world. The Romans invented imperialism, and all the Western powers are parts of the Roman Empire. After Britain defeated Spain to become the world power, for more than two centuries the gospel was spread to every corner of the earth through Roman imperialism.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THREE THINGS<br />
THAT ARE TAKING PLACE ON EARTH TODAY</h2>
<p>Today three things are taking place on earth: the consuming by the Roman locusts, the suffering of Israel, and the manifestation of Christ. We are joined neither to the consuming of the Roman locusts nor to the suffering of Israel but to the manifestation of Christ. Little of Christ is manifested in the Roman Catholic Church and in the denominations, but Christ is manifested in His recovery. Today we are in the line in which Christ is being manifested. The line of the manifestation of Christ will eventually bring us into the fuller manifestation of Christ in the age of restoration. This fuller manifestation of Christ will consummate in the fullest manifestation of Christ in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. This is the proper eschatology. This is the best, the clearest, and the most inclusive eschatology.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD AND THE BIBLE BOTH BEING REAL</h2>
<p>God is real. If God were not real, there could not be such a book as the Bible. The Bible tells us beforehand concerning world history. The Bible is the only book that predicts human history so accurately and all-inclusively. Therefore, we believe not only that our God is real but also that the Bible is real.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A CLEAR VIEW<br />
CONCERNING THREE MATTERS</h2>
<p>We all need to have a clear view of the age in which we are living, of where we are, and of what our goal should be.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Present Age</h2>
<p>We are living in an age, the continuation of the preceding ages, in which our God is still moving. He is working among the Jews and by the nations to perform His economy in the building up of the organism of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Where We Are</h2>
<p>We need to see that today we, the believers in Christ, are in the Body of Christ. We all are members of the Body of Christ, which is the organism of the Triune God. As members of the Body, we should aspire to be overcomers, the mighty ones (Joel 3:11) who will return with Christ to deal with Antichrist at the battle of Armageddon and who will be His co-kings in the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Goal as Members of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we should be clear concerning our goal as members of the Body. Our goal is to enlarge the manifestation of Christ intrinsically. We do not care for a mere outward enlargement. We do not appreciate a good outward appearance, and we do not want any kind of fa&#231;ade. On the contrary, we desire to see the intrinsic enlargement of the manifestation of Christ in the Spirit of the processed Triune God and by the life of our Father, the eternal, almighty divine Being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE OVERCOMING WAY</h2>
<p>I hope that we all will take not the ordinary Christian way but the overcoming way to be the mighty ones who can match the unique mighty One. Christ is now on the throne in the heavens, waiting for us to be perfected and matured. Eventually the time will be ripe for Him to come back to deal with the nations, to save the remnant of Israel, and to complete God&rsquo;s economy with us. Then the age of restoration will be ushered in. That age will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s expression in Christ.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON JOEL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FOUR FACTORS IN THE BOOK OF JOEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-32; 3:16-21</h1>
<p>In this message I would like to give a further word on the four factors, the four main principles, in the book of Joel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST FACTOR&mdash;<br />
THE CONSUMING OF THE LOCUSTS</h2>
<p>The first factor, or principle, is the consuming of the locusts, the consuming factor. &ldquo;What the cutting locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; / And what the swarming locust has left, the licking locust has eaten; / And what the licking locust has left, the consuming locust has eaten&rdquo; (1:4). These locusts denote the human government which has been existing for twenty-seven hundred years and which continues to exist. The governments of the nations have been and are still being used by God to consume Israel. On earth today there is such a consuming factor involving the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND FACTOR&mdash;<br />
THE SUFFERING OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>The second factor, the second principle, is the suffering factor, the suffering of Israel under the locusts. Israel has been suffering the consuming of the locusts for almost twenty-seven centuries. As we consider Israel&rsquo;s suffering, we may wonder why God has allowed it to last so long. We may question why God has permitted His elect to suffer under the consuming locusts. On the one hand, God allows this suffering to continue; on the other hand, He does not allow Israel to be utterly consumed. Israel is the only nation that has suffered the consuming of the locusts for such a long time. Nevertheless, Israel continues to endure and to last.</p>
<p>These two factors&mdash;the consuming factor involving the nations in four stages and the suffering factor involving Israel&mdash;have been present for a major part of human history. Many books have been written about world history, but these books do not touch these factors, these principles, as we are doing here.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE<br />
CONCERNING THE SUFFERING FACTOR</h2>
<p>We come now to the crucial matter of God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the suffering factor. The suffering factor is the factor which produced the incarnation. Through incarnation the almighty, eternal, infinite God was brought into humanity and mingled with humanity. Nothing, not even the creation of the universe, could be greater than this! God&rsquo;s purpose in allowing Israel to suffer under the locusts was to bring forth a couple, Mary and Joseph, so that God could be born in man, of man, and out of man to become no longer only God but a God-man. Hence, the suffering factor was the factor to consummate the divine incarnation; the suffering of the Jews was the factor to produce the incarnation. As a result of God&rsquo;s entering into humanity and His mingling with humanity, there is now a unique person&mdash;Jesus&mdash;who is both the complete God and a perfect man. God became a man, the man Jesus, and lived on this earth, making His home in Nazareth for thirty years. Surely this is the greatest miracle in the entire universe!</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S USE OF THE CONSUMING FACTOR</h2>
<p>We have seen that Israel was used by God through so much suffering for the purpose that God could be born out of man to be a God-man. Now we need to see how God has used the consuming factor and is still using this factor.</p>
<p>It is the first factor, the consuming factor, that has afforded all the necessary facilities in the environment for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose. The Roman Empire, the aggregate of the four empires, afforded everything necessary for the incarnated God to live and move and work on earth. Furthermore, the Roman Empire afforded the means for Christ to be crucified, for it had the governmental authority, prepared a cross, and even provided the soldiers to crucify the Lord Jesus.</p>
 <p>Both the consuming factor and the suffering factor have been useful to God. The Jews had lost their nation and had been scattered everywhere, wandering for centuries. Humanly speaking, that was a tragedy. But on the day of Pentecost, after God had consummated His long process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, He needed to pour Himself out upon the entire human race, not only upon one people but upon all peoples. For this outpouring a particular occasion was required, and the Roman Empire made it possible. First, the Roman Empire had scattered the Jews among all the peoples. Then, on exactly the right day, when the time was ripe, the Roman Empire provided the way for the scattered people to come back to Jerusalem to enjoy the feast. At that joyful time, God suddenly came down upon the people. From this we see that through the means of the suffering one, Israel, and by all the facilities provided by the consuming locust, the Roman government, God poured Himself out upon all flesh. Now we, as the church, are the manifestation of Christ, produced by the outpouring of the processed and consummated Triune God upon all flesh.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s locusts are also useful to God and to us, the members of the church, the Body of Christ. Because of the locusts we have such things as the telephone, the microphone, the recorder, the airplane, the computer, and the fax machine. Because of the locusts we in the United States enjoy the freedom of speech and the freedom to meet together as the church. The facilities provided by the locusts also save us a great deal of time. Therefore, we are thankful for the &ldquo;locust&rdquo; government and for the &ldquo;locust&rdquo; telephone and computer companies. In a very real sense, all the locusts are working for us. The millions of locusts swarming on earth today are serving us so that we may be here for the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD FACTOR&mdash;THE BENEFICIARIES</h2>
<p>The consuming of the locusts and the suffering of Israel are both for us. This means that we in the church life today are the beneficiaries of both the Jews and the nations. This is the third factor, the third principle. Paul says that all things work together for good for us (Rom. 8:28). Hence, we are the third factor&mdash;the beneficiaries. As the beneficiaries, we should thank the Lord for all that He has done for us through the consuming of the locusts and the suffering of the Jews.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOURTH FACTOR&mdash;<br />
THE PRINCIPLE OF RESTORATION</h2>
<p>The fourth factor in the book of Joel is the principle of restoration. In the future there will be an actual, practical, and real restoration, but today we, the third factor, are experiencing the restoration, the fourth factor, as we participate in and enjoy the manifestation of Christ, which has come through the first two factors, the consuming of the locusts and the suffering of Israel.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE UNIVERSAL HISTORY<br />
ACCORDING TO GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY&mdash;<br />
THE DIVINE HISTORY WITHIN THE HUMAN HISTORY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-29; 3:11-21</h1>
<p>In Joel we see the history of God, of man, and of God&rsquo;s economy. It was according to God&rsquo;s economy that the four kinds of locusts were raised up to consume Israel for so many years in order that He could fulfill His economy by being incarnated into humanity through Israel. Then with the help of the Roman Empire, Christ lived on earth, was crucified, and was resurrected to be enlarged, to produce the church. All of this was through these two factors&mdash;the consuming locusts and the suffering Israel&mdash;that God could fulfill His economy to have an expression, the organic Body of Christ. We are this Body, this expression. This is the universal history according to God&rsquo;s economy. In this message I would like to give a further word on this universal history.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO HISTORIES&mdash;THE HISTORY OF MAN<br />
AND THE HISTORY OF GOD</h2>
<p>We should not think that man has a history but that God does not have a history. In this universe there are two histories: the history of man, the human history, and the history of God, the divine history. We may liken the history of man to the shell of a walnut and the history of God to the kernel within the shell. In the Minor Prophets the &ldquo;shell&rdquo; is clearly defined, and the &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; is revealed in some detail. Unfortunately, however, most readers of the Bible pay attention only to the shell and not to the kernel.</p>
<p>The shell, the history of man, is easily seen. In Daniel 2 this history is signified by a great human image, with the four sections of this image corresponding respectively to the Babylonian Empire, the Medo-Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. Although it is easy for us to see the shell, which is something outward and physical, we must have a kind of intrinsic insight in order to see the kernel within the shell, to know the divine history within the human history.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE HISTORY<br />
WITHIN THE HUMAN HISTORY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Intention in His Economy</h2>
<p>If we would know the divine history that takes place within the human history, we first need to realize that the Triune God is eternal. For God to be eternal means that with Him there is no beginning. Within Himself, this eternal One made an economy. According to His economy, God wants to work Himself into man to be one with man, to be man&rsquo;s life, life supply, and everything, and to have man as His expression. God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is thus to have a corporate entity, composed of God and man, to be His expression for eternity. This divine history began with the eternal God and His economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Continuation of the Divine History</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation and Human Living</h2>
<p>The divine history continued with the incarnation and human living of Christ. One day the very God who created the universe became incarnated, being conceived of the Holy Spirit within the womb of a human virgin and then born of this virgin to be the God-man, the One who is the complete God and a perfect man. It is marvelous that God became a man named Jesus and that this man lived in Nazareth, working as a carpenter, until the age of thirty. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and His human living both are parts of the divine history, the history of God within the history of man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ&rsquo;s Crucifixion and Resurrection</h2>
<p>At the end of His life and ministry on earth, the Lord Jesus went willingly to the cross. His crucifixion was a vicarious death, an all-inclusive death which terminated the old creation and solved all problems. His death ushered Him into resurrection. On the one hand, in His resurrection He was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:4; 8:29). On the other hand, in and through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>
<p>Furthermore, through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection millions were begotten, regenerated, by God (1 Pet. 1:3) to be sons of God and to be members of the Body of Christ, the church. The Christ who was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, the Christ who ascended to the heavens and then descended as the Spirit, has produced the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God. The church today is the enlargement of the manifestation of Christ. Thus, the church also is part of the divine history, the intrinsic history of the divine mystery within the outward, human history. This part of God&rsquo;s history has lasted for more than nineteen hundred years, and it is still going on.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ&rsquo;s Coming Back, the Kingdom,<br />
and the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>At the end of this part of the divine history, Christ will come back, descending with His overcomers as His army (Joel 3:11) to defeat Antichrist and his army. There will be the meeting of two figures&mdash;Antichrist, a figure in the outward, human history, and Christ with His overcomers, the Figure in the intrinsic, divine history. The Figure in the divine history will defeat the figure in the human history and then cast him into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20). Following this, the thousand-year kingdom will come. Eventually, this kingdom will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate, the consummate, step of God&rsquo;s history.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A CLEAR VIEW OF THE TWO HISTORIES</h2>
<p>We need to have a clear view of these two histories&mdash;the physical human history and the mysterious divine history&mdash;and I hope that we all will have such a view. The history of man, the history of the world, is outward. The divine history, the history of God in and with humanity, is inward. This history is a matter of the divine mystery of the Triune God in humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BORN IN THE HUMAN HISTORY<br />
AND REBORN IN THE DIVINE HISTORY<br />
TO LIVE IN THE DIVINE HISTORY IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>We all were born in the human history, but we have been reborn, regenerated, in the divine history. Now we need to ask ourselves this question: Are we living in the divine history, or are we living merely in the human history? If our living is in the world, we are living in the human history. But if we are living in the church, we are living in the divine history. In the church life God&rsquo;s history is our history. Now two parties&mdash;God and we&mdash;have one history, the divine history. This is the church life.</p>
<p>With the divine history there is the new creation&mdash;the new man with a new heart, a new spirit, a new life, a new nature, a new history, and a new consummation. We praise the Lord that we are in the divine history, experiencing and enjoying the mysterious, divine things.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HISTORY OF GOD WITH MAN<br />
AND<br />
THE HISTORY OF GOD IN MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-29; 3:11-21</h1>
<p>The Bible is a wonderful book. Because the Bible is wonderful, it is mysterious. Although a great many people have read and continue to read the Bible, few know what the Bible talks about. The Bible has much to say about God, Christ, Israel, and many other things, but what does the Bible actually talk about? If we would answer this question, we need to study the Minor Prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINOR PROPHETS&mdash;<br />
A KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Minor Prophets are a key to understanding the Bible. In our study of the Minor Prophets, we have emphasized four points: God&rsquo;s chastisement of Israel, God&rsquo;s punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration of all things. Through God&rsquo;s chastisement of Israel and His punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ is brought forth, and the manifestation of Christ will bring in the restoration. This restoration will include not only Israel but the whole human race, the earth, and the entire universe. The new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem will be the eternal restoration of all things. These four matters are revealed in the Bible, in particular in the Minor Prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING THE HISTORY OF GOD<br />
IN TWO PORTIONS</h2>
<p>The Bible may be considered the history of God. If we human beings have a history, not only as a race but even as individuals, then surely the unique, universal, and wonderful person of God must also have a history. Where do we find the history of God? God&rsquo;s history, the divine history, is recorded in the Bible.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s history is of two portions&mdash;the history of God <em>with</em> man, found in the Old Testament, and the history of God <em>in</em> man, found in the New Testament. In the Old Testament God&rsquo;s history was a history with man. In the New Testament God&rsquo;s history is a history in man, for this history involves God&rsquo;s being one with man. Therefore, the history of God in the New Testament is a divine history in humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The History of God with Man</h2>
<p>God created man according to Himself, that is, in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). We may say that the man created in God&rsquo;s image was a &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; of God. As a photograph of a person shows us something concerning that person himself to a certain degree, so the man created by God as a photograph of God can show forth God only to a limited extent. After God created man, He was with man, but He was still outside of man. Hence, in the Old Testament we see God not in man or one with man but simply with man. In Genesis, Exodus, the Psalms, and the entire Old Testament, God was with man but not yet in man and not yet one with man.</p>
<p>The Old Testament does not speak mainly concerning man; rather, it speaks mainly concerning God. God has the primary role, and man has the subordinate role. The history in the Old Testament, therefore, is God&rsquo;s history, God&rsquo;s history with man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The History of God in Man</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s history in the New Testament is very different. Beginning with the first chapter of Matthew and continuing to the last chapter of Revelation, we have God coming into man and being one with man. The New Testament reveals that God is now in man and one with man. Thus, God&rsquo;s history in the New Testament is the history of God in man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Incarnation Accomplishing Two Things</h2>
<h2 class="head4">Bringing God into Man</h2>
<p>Regarding the history of God in man, the incarnation of Christ accomplished two things. First, the incarnation brought God into man. Before the incarnation, as the Old Testament reveals, God was merely with man; He was outside of man. But by incarnation God entered into man, and from that time onward the history of God was different. Whereas in the past God was with man, and His history was a history with man, now God was in man, and His history began to be a history in man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Making God One with Man</h2>
<p>Second, the incarnation made God one with man. As a result of the incarnation, there was a wonderful person&mdash;a person who is the mingling of God with man. This person, Jesus, is not only God, and He is not merely a man. He is the complete God and the perfect man. Further, He is not only God in man&mdash;He is God mingled with man.</p>
<p>From this we see that the incarnation was an unprecedented event. Prior to the incarnation, there was not such a person, a person who is both God and man. But now, as a result of the incarnation, there is a wonderful person who is the mingling of God with man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Our Involvement with the God-man</h2>
<p>As believers, we all have become involved with this wonderful person, this One who is both God and man. A verse which speaks of this involvement is Revelation 22:17a, which says, &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&rdquo; The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the transformed tripartite man. As this verse reveals, these two, the Spirit and the bride, will be married, joined to become one entity, one corporate person. This is a strong indication that, in the New Testament, God is in man and is one with man. The New Jerusalem is a marvelous sign demonstrating how God is in man and is one with man.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN NOT TAKING GOD&rsquo;S WAY</h2>
<p>The history of God with man and of God in man is not a simple matter. God was with man with the intention of coming into man and being one with man. Man was created by God for this purpose. But although God had such a purpose in creating man, man has another, subtle, purpose, and these two purposes do not agree. God has His way, and man has his way. Because of this, even when man cooperates with God, he does this not by God&rsquo;s way but by his own way. Thus, there are two lines&mdash;God&rsquo;s line and man&rsquo;s line. God wants to come into man and to be one with man. Man, however, does not take God&rsquo;s way but insists on his own way. This insistence has caused, and continues to cause, great failure. As a result, in the sight of God man has become sinful, corrupt, and abominable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD COMING IN TO CHASTISE<br />
HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE AND TO PUNISH THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>Because man, including Israel, has taken his own way and has become sinful and corrupt, God comes in to chastise Israel, His chosen people, and to punish the nations. When God chastises His people Israel, He has no intention of utterly destroying them. On the one hand, God chastises Israel; on the other hand, He has promised not to destroy them completely.</p>
<p>In order to chastise Israel God needs a &ldquo;rod,&rdquo; a means of discipline, and this rod is the nations. In Joel 1:4 the nations are likened to locusts in four stages: the cutting locust (the Babylonian Empire), the swarming locust (the Medo-Persian Empire), the licking locust (the Macedonian- Grecian Empire), and the consuming locust (the Roman Empire). Of these four kinds of locusts&mdash;Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman&mdash;the Roman locusts are still with us today.</p>
 <p>Although God allows the locusts to cut, swarm, lick, and consume, He does not permit them to destroy His people utterly. Whenever the locusts have gone too far, acting without regard for justice, God has come in to punish them. Whereas God uses the nations to chastise Israel, He also punishes the nations for going too far.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CHASTISEMENT OF ISRAEL<br />
AND HIS PUNISHMENT OF THE NATIONS<br />
AFFORDING A WAY FOR CHRIST TO BE MANIFESTED<br />
FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE FALLEN UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s chastisement of Israel and His punishment of the nations affords a way for Christ to be manifested. Thus, the Minor Prophets speak not only of the chastisement of Israel and the punishment of the nations but also of the issue of this chastisement and punishment&mdash;the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<p>The manifestation of Christ has a goal, and this goal is to restore the fallen universe. The fall of the universe was caused by two rebellions. The first rebellion was the rebellion of Satan and the angels who followed him; the second was the rebellion of man. These two rebellions&mdash;the angelic and the human&mdash;defiled and polluted the universe, so the God-created universe needs a restoration.</p>
<p>This restoration can be brought in only through the manifestation of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s manifestation implies His incarnation, redemption, and many other matters. The manifestation of Christ has been going on for a long time, and it will continue until the fallen universe has been fully restored. Eventually, in the consummation of the restoration, there will be the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center. In the New Jerusalem we all will enjoy Christ and express Christ for eternity. This is the history of God with man and in man revealed in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LESSON FOR US TODAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Our Failure</h2>
<p>The history of God in the Bible provides a lesson for us today. God created us with the intention to gain us so that He could come into us and be one with us. However, either we do not care for God or we care for God according to our own way. The result is always total failure. Paul confessed his failure when he said, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am!&rdquo; (Rom. 7:24a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Need for God&rsquo;s Chastisement</h2>
<p>Because we are a failure and because our situation is wretched, terrible, and miserable, we need God&rsquo;s chastisement. For this reason, our human life as Christians is a life of chastisement through the sufferings caused by different kinds of &ldquo;locusts.&rdquo; Our husband or wife, our children, our job, our desire for higher education, our attempts to make more money&mdash;all these are locusts that cut us, swarm over us, lick us, and consume us. These &ldquo;locusts&rdquo; make our life a life of suffering and our days, days of God&rsquo;s chastisement. The goal, the purpose, of this chastisement is that Christ would be manifested in us for the restoration of the universe. Eventually, the manifestation of Christ that is the issue of suffering and chastisement will consummate in the restoration of the entire universe.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON AMOS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INTRODUCTORY WORD,<br />
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENTS<br />
ON THE SURROUNDING NATIONS,<br />
AND<br />
HIS JUDGMENTS ON JUDAH AND ISRAEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Amos 1:1&mdash;2:16</h1>
<p>The book of Amos, as one of the Minor Prophets, also covers the chastisement of Israel and the punishment upon the nations to bring in the manifestation of Christ, issuing in the restoration, which consummates in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<p>In this message we will cover three matters: the introductory word, Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on the surrounding nations, and His judgments on Judah and Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>The introductory word is in 1:1-2.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Amos</h2>
<p><em>Amos</em> in Hebrew means &ldquo;burden bearer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Amos&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Amos&rsquo;s ministry was about 787 B.C. (1:1a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the northern kingdom of Israel (1:1b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Bethel in the northern kingdom of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the book of Amos is Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on Israel and the surrounding nations, with the issue of restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of the prophecy of Amos, which is nearly the same as that of Hosea and Joel, is that Jehovah punishes the nations, taking Israel as the center, that the age of restoration (Matt. 19:28) may be brought in for the kingdom of David&mdash;the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In the book of Amos the revelation concerning Christ is implied in the tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David, which is a type of the kingdom of Christ (Amos 9:11-12; cf. Acts 15:16-17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Amos has five sections: the introductory word (1:1-2); Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on the surrounding nations (1:3&mdash;2:3); Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on Judah and Israel (2:4-16); Jehovah&rsquo;s contending with the house of Jacob (3:1&mdash;9:10), including Jehovah&rsquo;s three reproofs to Israel (3:1&mdash;5:27) and the plagues of the five signs seen by Amos (6:1&mdash;9:10); and the restoration of the house of Israel, with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David for the kingdom of Christ (9:11-15).</p><h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENTS<br />
ON THE SURROUNDING NATIONS</h2>
<p>In 1:3&mdash;2:3 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on the surrounding nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. On Damascus</h2>
<p>In 1:3-5 the prophet speaks concerning Damascus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Its Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>The words &ldquo;because of three transgressions of Damascus&rdquo; and &ldquo;because of four&rdquo; indicate repeated transgressions (v. 3a). Damascus was to be judged for its repeated transgressions&mdash;for its threshing Gilead with sharp threshing tools of iron (v. 3b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>Jehovah would send fire into the house of the king and devour the palaces of the king. Also, he would break its bar and cut off the inhabitant and the one in power, and put the people into captivity (vv. 4-5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. On Gaza</h2>
<p>In verses 6 through 8 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Gaza.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Its Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>Gaza would be judged for its repeated transgressions. Gaza carried away captive the entire captivity in order to deliver them up to Edom, a synonym of Esau (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>Gaza&rsquo;s sin offended God to the uttermost. Verses 7 and 8 say that He would send fire to the city of Gaza to devour its palaces and that He would cut off the inhabitant and the one in power and cause the remnant of the Philistines to perish.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. On Tyre</h2>
<p>In verses 9 and 10 the prophet goes on to speak concerning Tyre.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Its Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>Tyre also would be judged for its repeated transgressions in delivering up the captivity of Israel to Edom and not remembering a covenant among brothers, the covenant among Esau and Jacob (v. 9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>In His punishment of the city of Tyre, Jehovah would send fire to the city, and it would devour its palaces (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. On Edom</h2>
<p>In verses 11 and 12 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Edom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Its Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>Edom&rsquo;s repeated transgressions were related to pursuing his brother (Jacob) with the sword, stifling his compassions, causing his anger to rage continually, and keeping his overflowing wrath perpetually (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>In His punishment of Edom, Jehovah would send fire upon it and devour the palaces of its capital (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. On Ammon</h2>
<p>Verses 13 through 15 deal with Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Ammon.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Its Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>Ammon (a son of Lot by incest) ripped up the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their border (v. 13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>Jehovah would kindle a fire in the capital, and it would devour its palaces with shouting in the day of battle and a tempest in the day of the storm wind (v. 14). Also, their king and his princes would go into captivity (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. On Moab</h2>
<p>In 2:1-3 we have a word regarding Moab.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Its Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>Moab (also a son of Lot by incest) burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime (v. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>Jehovah would send fire upon Moab and devour the palaces of its capital. He would cause Moab to die with a crash, with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet. Furthermore, He would cut off its judge and slay all its princes with him (vv. 2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENTS ON JUDAH AND ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Amos 2:4-16 is a record of Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on Judah (vv. 4-5) and Israel (vv. 6-16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. On Judah</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Its Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Judah was due to their rejecting the law of Jehovah and not keeping His statutes and due to their following their fathers to lie (v. 4). Judah&rsquo;s lies caused them to err.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s punishment of Judah was to send fire upon Judah, a fire that would devour the palaces of Jerusalem (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. On Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Their Repeated Transgressions</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Israel was due to their having sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals (v. 6), panting after the dust of the earth upon the heads of the poor (v. 7a), and turning aside the way of the meek (v. 7b). Israel also transgressed in that a man and his father went in unto the same woman, in order to profane Jehovah&rsquo;s holy name (v. 7c). Upon garments taken as pledge, Israel lay themselves down beside every altar (v. 8a). The poor were so destitute when borrowing money that they would give their bedding as a pledge. The person who took the pledge would then spread the bedding around an altar as he worshipped idols. This was evil in the eyes of God. Moreover, in the house (the temple) of their God, Israel drank the wine of those who had been fined (v. 8b). They also made the Nazarites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy (vv. 9-12). The prophets and the Nazarites were the holy people raised up by God, but these holy people were damaged because Israel charged the prophets not to prophesy and seduced the Nazarites to drink wine.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>In His punishment, Jehovah would press on Israel like a cart that is full of sheaves (v. 13). Flight would perish from the swift; the strong would not strengthen his force, nor would the mighty deliver his soul. He who wielded the bow would not stand, he who was swift of foot would not deliver himself, and he who rode the horse would not deliver his soul (vv. 14-15). Finally, Jehovah declared that he who was stout-hearted among the mighty men would flee away naked in that day (v. 16). As these verses make clear, when God comes in to judge, there is no way to escape.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON AMOS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S CONTENDING WITH THE HOUSE OF JACOB</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Amos 3&mdash;5</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider Jehovah&rsquo;s contending with the house of Jacob.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S THREE REPROOFS TO ISRAEL</h2>
<p>The content of 3:1&mdash;5:27 is Jehovah&rsquo;s three reproofs to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The First Reproof</h2>
<p>The first reproof is recorded in chapter three.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah&rsquo;s Word<br />
against the Whole Family of Israel</h2>
<p>Amos 3:1 indicates that the word in this chapter is Jehovah&rsquo;s word against the whole family of Israel, which He brought up from Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel Being the Only Family<br />
of the Earth Whom Jehovah Has Known</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says that since Israel was the only family of the earth whom Jehovah has known, He would visit upon them (judge them for) all their iniquities.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Cause of Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>Verses 3 through 8 indicate that the cause of Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation (punishment) was that Israel was not one with God. They had their own intention, goal, and purpose, and God had His. But God revealed all His secrets to His prophets. Israel, therefore, should have listened to the prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Oppressions, Violence, and Devastation<br />
in Samaria and Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>Verses 9 through 12 go on to speak of the oppressions, violence, and devastation in Samaria and Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Transgressions of Israel<br />
at the Altars of Bethel<br />
and Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>In verses 13 through 15 we have the transgressions of Israel at the altars of Bethel and Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation. Bethel had become a place for the worship of idols. The winter house and the summer house in verse 15 were luxurious retreat houses. Here, such houses and the worship of idols are regarded as one thing. Those who went to the retreat houses for enjoyment were also those who worshipped idols at the altars of Bethel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Second Reproof</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s second reproof to Israel is in chapter four.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Oppression on the Poor<br />
and the Crushing of the Needy in Samaria<br />
and Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>Jehovah reproved Israel for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy and for saying to their lords, &ldquo;Bring, and let us drink&rdquo; (v. 1). On the one hand, they oppressed the poor, crushed the needy, and indulged themselves in pleasures. On the other hand, they were under God&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel&rsquo;s Idol Worship in Bethel and Gilgal</h2>
<p>Verses 4 and 5 are concerned with Israel&rsquo;s idol worship in Bethel and Gilgal.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation with the Expectation<br />
of Israel&rsquo;s Return to Him</h2>
<p>In verses 6 through 13 the prophet speaks regarding Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation with the expectation of Israel&rsquo;s return to Him and their preparation to meet Him who is the Creator and Ruler of all things.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Third Reproof</h2>
<p>In chapter five we have Jehovah&rsquo;s third reproof to Israel, the strongest of the three reproofs.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. A Lamentation Taken Up by Jehovah<br />
over the House of Israel</h2>
<p>Verse 1 indicates that the third reproof is a lamentation taken up by Jehovah over the house of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel&rsquo;s Fall and Defeat</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fallen and no more to rise / Is the virgin of Israel; / She has been cast down upon her land; / There is none to raise her up. / For thus says the Lord Jehovah, / The city that sent forth a thousand / Will have a hundred left, / And that which sent forth a hundred / Will have ten left, / To the house of Israel&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). This is a word concerning Israel&rsquo;s fall and defeat in war.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah Advising Israel to Seek Him and Live</h2>
<p>In verses 4 through 9 Jehovah advises Israel to seek Him and live. They should not seek Bethel nor go to Gilgal, both of which would be under Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<p>Verse 7 says, &ldquo;They turn justice to wormwood / And thrust righteousness down to the ground.&rdquo; This means that the leaders did not care for justice and righteousness and did not care for the people according to the law of God. Instead, they turned justice into something bitter and cast righteousness to the ground.</p>
<p>Verses 8 and 9 continue, &ldquo;He who makes the Pleiades and Orion / And turns the shadow of death into the morning / And darkens the day with the night; / He who calls for the water of the sea / And pours it upon the surface of the earth, / Jehovah is His name, / Who causes destruction to flash forth upon the strong, / So that destruction comes upon the fortress.&rdquo; Since God can do these things, Israel should be advised to seek Him and live.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Israel&rsquo;s Transgressions of Injustice<br />
in Spite of Their Hypocritical Services<br />
with Offerings to Jehovah, and Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>Verses 10 through 27 describe Israel&rsquo;s transgressions of injustice in spite of their hypocritical services with offerings to Jehovah, and Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation. They hated him who reproved in the gate, the place where the leading ones exercised judgment, and they abhorred the one who spoke with integrity (v. 10). They took a forced gift (a bribe) from the poor (v. 11). Their transgressions were many, and their sins were mighty (awful). Eventually, the day of Jehovah will come upon them, a horrible day, and they will suffer woe, for it will be darkness to them and not light (vv. 16-20).</p>
<p>On the one hand, the people of Israel were evil; on the other hand, they still worshipped God with offerings. They liked to have the feasts and to assemble for the worship of God. Because of their hypocrisy, Jehovah said to them, &ldquo;I hate, I despise your feasts, / And I will not delight in your solemn assemblies&rdquo; (v. 21). He went on to tell them to take away from Him the noise of their songs and &ldquo;let justice roll down like water, / And righteousness, like an ever-flowing river&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). Instead of making noise and singing songs, they should exercise justice and practice righteousness.</p>
<p>All the Prophets are on the same subject, but each one gives a different picture from a different angle or with a different aspect. By reading all the Prophets we can realize how evil the children of Israel were and how loving God was toward them.</p>
<p>Beginning approximately two hundred years before the coming of Nebuchadnezzar, God sent the prophets to warn Israel, to advise them, and to call them to return to God. However, Israel did not listen to the prophets. This forced God to send the four kinds of locusts (Joel 1:4) to chastise Israel for twenty-seven centuries. From this we all need to learn an important lesson: God means business. For twenty-seven centuries God has been sending locusts to deal with Israel. Today the Roman Empire is still consuming Israel, and Israel continues to suffer.</p>
 <p>In the midst of such a situation, God has done something marvelous. First, He came to be incarnated as a man, and He lived on earth to set up a model of how to have the divine life expressed in humanity, of how to have the divine attributes expressed in the human virtues. Then He died a particular death for our sins, and He entered into resurrection and ascended. Then He was poured out as the Spirit in His descension to be one with us to produce a corporate Christ, that is, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>All these things are mysterious. No one can see them. But these are the things that accomplished God&rsquo;s economy. The chastising of Israel and the judgment on the nations are the &ldquo;shell&rdquo;; they are not the &ldquo;kernel.&rdquo; The kernel is the mysterious things in the age of mystery, which began with Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and will end with Christ&rsquo;s second appearing. These are the governing principles that we should hold when we read the Old Testament, especially the Prophets.</p>
<p>Today three things are taking place on earth: the chastisement of God over Israel, God&rsquo;s punishment of the nations, and the manifestation of Christ. Today we are enjoying all the conveniences invented by the Roman Empire for the manifestation of Christ. The chastisement of Israel, the punishment of the nations, and the manifestation of Christ are great matters, for they are the items of the universal history according to God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<h1 class="title">ON AMOS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S CONTENDING WITH THE HOUSE OF JACOB</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">AND<br />
THE RESTORATION OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL<br />
WITH THE REBUILDING<br />
OF THE FALLEN TABERNACLE OF DAVID<br />
FOR THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Amos 6&mdash;9</h1>
<p>Amos 3:1&mdash;9:10 covers Jehovah&rsquo;s contending, His verbal fighting, with the house of Jacob. As we saw in the previous message, in chapters three through five we have Jehovah&rsquo;s three reproofs to Israel. In 6:1&mdash;9:10 we have the plagues of the five signs seen by Amos, and in 9:11-15, a word concerning the restoration of the house of Israel with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David for the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE PLAGUES OF THE FIVE SIGNS SEEN BY AMOS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Introduction</h2>
<p>Amos 6:1-14 is an introduction to the plagues of the five signs.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Israel, Especially the High Class,<br />
Living at Ease a Life of Luxuries</h2>
<p>In this introduction Israel, especially the high class, is described as living at ease a life of luxuries and pleasures but turning justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood, rejoicing in things of vanity, and boasting of taking horns for themselves by their own strength (vv. 1-6, 12-13). They boasted that they enjoyed everything and had everything by their own strength and through their own capability.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Punishment</h2>
<p>Because of this, Jehovah&rsquo;s punishment would be meted out through the enemy&lsquo;s oppression, captivity, killing, and destruction (vv. 7-11, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Plague of the First Sign&mdash;<br />
Locusts to Eat the Herbage of the Land</h2>
<p>The plague of the first sign was that of the locusts eating the herbage of the land (7:1-3). The locusts symbolize the enemy&rsquo;s army.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Prophet Praying<br />
That the Lord Jehovah Would Forgive<br />
Because Jacob Was Small and Could Not Stand</h2>
<p>When the prophet saw that the eating of the herbage of the land was complete, he prayed, &ldquo;O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech You! How will Jacob stand, for he is small?&rdquo; (v. 2). Some of the punishments ordained of God have not taken place because some of God&rsquo;s loving ones, the prophets, prayed for Israel, warning God that Israel might not endure.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Repenting and Stopping the Plague</h2>
<p>When Jehovah heard Amos&rsquo;s prayer, He repented and stopped the plague (v. 3).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Plague of the Second Sign&mdash;<br />
Fire to Devour the Great Deep and the Land</h2>
<p>The second plague was that of fire to devour the great deep (the deep water) and the land (v. 4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Prophet Praying That the Lord Would Stop It</h2>
<p>The prophet prayed that the Lord would stop it, for Jacob was small and could not stand (v. 5).</p>
 <h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Repenting and Stopping the Plague</h2>
<p>Jehovah repented and stopped the plague (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Plague of the Third Sign&mdash;<br />
a Plumb Line in the Lord&rsquo;s Hand</h2>
<p>The plague of the third sign was that of a plumb line in the Lord&rsquo;s hand (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Telling Amos<br />
That He Was Now Setting a Plumb Line<br />
in the Midst of His People Israel</h2>
<p>The Lord was holding a plumb line to measure Israel in order to determine what part had to be destroyed and what part had to be retained. Here the Lord was like a surgeon, knowing what should be cut off and what should remain.</p>
<p>The Lord told Amos that He was now setting a plumb line in the midst of His people Israel (v. 8a). He said, &ldquo;The high places of Isaac will be desolated, / And the sanctuaries of Israel will be made waste; / And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword&rdquo; (v. 9). The &ldquo;high places&rdquo; were the places where Israel worshipped the idols on the mountains. The expression &ldquo;sanctuaries of Israel&rdquo; refers not to the sanctuary in the city of Jerusalem but mainly to the sanctuaries in Bethel, in the northern kingdom of Israel. God would make them waste; He would attack the house of Jeroboam (one of the kings of Israel) with a sword.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Lord Not Passing By<br />
the People of Israel Again Anymore</h2>
<p>The Lord said that He would not pass by the people of Israel again anymore (v. 8b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Frustration by Amaziah the Priest of Bethel</h2>
<p>In verses 10 through 17 we see the frustration by Amaziah the priest of Bethel, a false priest. In Bethel, in the northern kingdom of Israel, they had built a kind of temple and had their own priests.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Amaziah&rsquo;s Words of Frustration</h2>
<p>Amaziah spoke to Amos, trying to frustrate him from prophesying (vv. 10-13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Amos&rsquo;s Answer to Amaziah</h2>
<p>Amos answered, &ldquo;Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel&rdquo; (v. 15b), and he prophesied against Amaziah and against Israel (vv. 16-17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Plague of the Fourth Sign&mdash;Summer Fruit</h2>
<p>The plague of the fourth sign, the sign of summer fruit, is covered in chapter eight. The summer fruit signifies that the time is ripe and the end has come upon Israel. The fruit of the fig tree is ripe for someone to pick it.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Not Passing By<br />
the People of Israel Again Anymore</h2>
<p>The Lord will not pass by the people of Israel again anymore (v. 2b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Tragedy among Israel</h2>
<p>Verses 3 through 10 indicate that there will be tragedy among Israel.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Lacking of the Word of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 11 through 13 indicate that there will be the lacking of the word of Jehovah. Our lacking of the word of Jehovah is a kind of punishment from Jehovah. For example, after Abraham took Hagar to produce Ishmael, God did not speak to him for thirteen years (Gen. 16:15&mdash;17:1). In the northern kingdom of Israel, the same thing happened. Because of their sins against the Lord, He would not speak to them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Worshippers of the Calf of Samaria<br />
and of the Idols in Dan and Beer-sheba<br />
Falling and Not Rising Up Again</h2>
<p>Amos 7:14 says that the worshippers of the calf of Samaria and of the idols in Dan and Beer-sheba would fall and not rise up again.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Plague of the Fifth Sign&mdash;<br />
the Lord Standing upon the Altar</h2>
<p>The plague of the first sign was the locusts; the plague of the second, fire; the plague of the third, the plumb line; and the plague of the fourth, the summer fruit. Now the fifth sign is the Lord standing upon the altar (9:1-10), signifying that the Lord is ready to destroy Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Shaking and Slaying</h2>
<p>Verses 1 through 4 speak concerning the shaking and slaying.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Judging One</h2>
<p>In verses 5 and 6 we see Jehovah as the judging One.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Lord&rsquo;s Destruction of Israel<br />
Not an Utter Destruction of the House of Jacob</h2>
<p>Verses 7 through 10 reveal that the Lord&rsquo;s destruction of Israel the sinful kingdom would not be an utter destruction of the house of Jacob. The Lord would cause them to suffer but would not allow them to be utterly consumed because He has a purpose. If there had been no Israel left on earth, how could Christ have been born of them? For the purpose of incarnation God had to preserve a remnant of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE RESTORATION OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL<br />
WITH THE REBUILDING OF THE FALLEN TABERNACLE<br />
OF DAVID FOR THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The restoration of the house of Israel with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David is covered in verses 11 through 15.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Raising Up the Fallen Tabernacle<br />
of David That Israel May Possess<br />
the Remnant of Edom and All the Nations<br />
Which Are Called by the Name of Jehovah</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In that day I will raise up / The fallen tabernacle of David, / And I will wall up its breaches / And raise up its ruins / And build it up as it was in the days of old; / That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations which are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). This portion of Amos is quoted by James in Acts 15, when the apostles and the elders were gathered together to solve the problem of circumcision.</p>
<p>The tabernacle of David is the kingdom and the royal family of David. In ancient times it was hard to separate the royal family from the kingdom. Actually these two things are one. David&rsquo;s kingdom was David&rsquo;s royal family. That kingdom, that royal family, fell when Nebuchadnezzar came to capture the nation of Israel, devastate the land, burn the city, destroy the temple, and carry off the king. That was the fall of the kingdom of David and the royal family of David. However, in Amos God came in to promise that some day He would come back to restore the fallen kingdom of David. In that day the kingdom of David and the family of David will be restored, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p>This prophecy in Amos indicates that one day Christ will come back to be the real David. When Christ comes back, in His last appearing He will be the real David to restore His kingdom and His royal family. That will be the millennial kingdom, in which all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah, that is, all the nations will belong to God. It was based on this that in Acts 15 James told the Jewish believers not to be bothered by Peter&rsquo;s and Paul&rsquo;s going to the Gentiles, because in the restoration all the Gentiles will belong to God, just like the Jews.</p>
<p>Christ will come and restore the fallen kingdom of David to set up His kingdom for the restoration of the entire universe. At that time all the nations will become God&rsquo;s people. This is a great item in Amos&rsquo;s prophecy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Plowman Overtaking the Reaper,<br />
and the Grape Treader, Him Who Sows the Seed</h2>
<p>Amos 9:13 says that days are coming when the plowman will overtake the reaper, and the grape treader, him who sows the seed. The mountains will drip sweet wine, and all the hills will melt (cf. Joel 3:18a). This indicates that in the restoration the produce from the earth will be abundant. There will be plenty of food for everyone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah Turning the Captivity of His People</h2>
<p>Amos 9:14 tells us that Jehovah will turn the captivity of His people Israel. They will build the desolated cities and inhabit them. Also, they will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them, and make gardens and eat the fruit from them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah Planting<br />
the People of Israel upon Their Land</h2>
<p>Amos concludes his prophecy by saying that Jehovah will plant the people of Israel upon their land, and they will not be plucked up again from their land, which He has given to them (v. 15).</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON OBADIAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALING WITH ESAU<br />
AND<br />
JACOB&rsquo;S VICTORY FOR THE KINGDOM OF JEHOVAH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Obad. 1-21</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the prophecy of Obadiah.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Obadiah</h2>
<p>In Hebrew the name Obadiah means &ldquo;the servant of Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Obadiah&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Obadiah&rsquo;s ministry was about 880 or 587 B.C. It is hard to determine which date is correct.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of Obadiah&rsquo;s ministry was the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of Obadiah&rsquo;s ministry also was the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the book of Obadiah is Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with Esau and Jacob&rsquo;s victory for the kingdom of Jehovah, which is the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Obadiah is that Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with Esau issues in Jacob&rsquo;s victory and possession for the kingdom of God in the age of restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Obadiah has five sections: the introductory word (v. 1a); Jehovah&rsquo;s dealings with Edom (vv. 1b-9); the evils of Edom (vv. 10-14); the day of Jehovah upon all the nations (vv. 15-16); and the issue of Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing (vv. 17-21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALINGS WITH EDOM</h2>
<p>Verses 1b through 9 are concerned with Jehovah&rsquo;s dealings with Edom. Whereas Esau is the name of a person, the twin brother of Jacob, Edom is the name of a country.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Stirring Up the Nations<br />
to Rise Up against It for Battle</h2>
<p>Jehovah dealt with Edom by stirring up the nations to rise up against it for battle (v. 1b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having Made Edom Small among the Nations</h2>
<p>God purposely dealt with Edom by making him small among the nations and very much despised (v. 2). As a result, Edom was a lowly nation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Bringing Edom Down from Its Dwelling<br />
in the Lofty Clefts of the Rock to the Ground</h2>
<p>Because of its arrogance Jehovah will bring Edom from its dwelling in the lofty clefts of the rock to the ground (vv. 3-4). The people of Edom were proud of their lofty dwelling and thought that they were higher and more lofty than others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Edom&rsquo;s Being Plundered<br />
by the Thieves and Spoilers</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with Edom included their being plundered by the thieves and spoilers (vv. 5-6). Although they lived in the lofty places, the thieves and spoilers still visited them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Edom&rsquo;s Being Deceived by Its Confederacy</h2>
<p>Edom was also deceived by its confederacy (v. 7). Some nations formed a confederacy with Edom, but eventually they were unfaithful to Edom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Destroying Its Wise Men,<br />
Dismaying Its Mighty Men, and<br />
Cutting Off Each One from the Mountain of Esau</h2>
<p>Jehovah dealt with Edom further by destroying its wise men, dismaying its mighty men, and cutting off each one from the mountain of Esau (vv. 8-9).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE EVILS OF EDOM</h2>
<p>In verses 10 through 14 we have a description of the evils of Edom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Violent against His Brother Jacob</h2>
<p>Edom did evil by being violent against his brother Jacob (v. 10). The nation of Edom was always violent against Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Standing on the Side When Strangers<br />
Took His Brother&rsquo;s Substance Captive</h2>
<p>Edom did evil also by standing on the side when strangers took his brother&rsquo;s substance captive and foreigners entered into his brother&rsquo;s gates and cast lots over Jerusalem, and he was like one of them (v. 11). He was happy to see that Jacob was suffering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Looking to the Day of His Brother&rsquo;s Misfortune</h2>
<p>Edom looked to the day of his brother&rsquo;s misfortune, rejoiced concerning the children of Judah in their destruction, and boasted in their distress (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Entering the Gate of Israel<br />
and Looking on Israel&rsquo;s Affliction</h2>
<p>Edom also entered the gate of Israel, looked on Israel&rsquo;s affliction, and sent forth his hands on their substance in their calamity (v. 13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Standing at the Crossroads<br />
to Cut Off Those of Israel Who Escaped</h2>
<p>Edom stood at the crossroads to cut off those of Israel who escaped and delivered them to their enemy in their distress (v. 14).</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing but jealousy and hatred between these twin brothers. Esau&rsquo;s hatred of Jacob was not without cause. Jacob not only grasped Esau&rsquo;s heel at their birth (Gen. 25:26) but also cheated Esau of the blessing of the birthright (Gen. 27:18-36). Thus, Esau liked to see Jacob suffer. Whenever Israel suffered from a natural calamity, Edom would rob Israel of their wealth. God&rsquo;s dealing with this situation reveals that He is very human. He judged the nation of Edom concerning a matter of human affection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE DAY OF JEHOVAH UPON ALL THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>Obadiah 15 and 16 are a word regarding the day of Jehovah upon all the nations. This is a matter of God&rsquo;s judgment upon Edom and the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Principle for Judging Edom</h2>
<p>In verse 15 we have the principle for judging Edom. This principle is that as Edom has done to others, it will be done to them. They will be treated in the same way as they have treated others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Principle for Judging the Nations</h2>
<p>The principle for judging the nations is revealed in verse 16. Because of the profane action of the nations in enjoying themselves upon the holy mountain of God&rsquo;s sanctuary, God would cause the other nations to drink continually at the places of those nations who participated in that profane action. In this way God would recompense the nations who drank at His holy mountain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE ISSUE OF JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALING</h2>
<p>In verses 17 through 21 we see the issue of Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The House of Jacob Being Saved and Sanctified</h2>
<p>As the issue of His dealing, Jehovah will save the house of Jacob and sanctify them (v. 17a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The House of Jacob Overcoming Edom</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The house of Jacob will be a fire, / And the house of Joseph a flame; / And the house of Esau will be as stubble, / And they will burn among them and devour them; / And there will be no survivor / To the house of Esau, / For Jehovah has spoken&rdquo; (v. 18). This tells us that, as the issue of God&rsquo;s dealing, the house of Jacob will overcome Edom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The House of Jacob<br />
Possessing Edom&rsquo;s Possessions</h2>
<p>The house of Jacob will possess Edom&rsquo;s possessions: the mountain of Esau, the Philistines, the field of Ephraim and the field of Samaria, Gilead, as far as Zarephath, and the cities of the south (vv. 17b, 19-20).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Saviors Coming Up on Mount Zion<br />
to Judge the Mountain of Esau</h2>
<p>Saviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will be Jehovah&rsquo;s (v. 21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Fulfilled at the Maccabees&rsquo; Time<br />
and to Be Much More Fulfilled in Glory<br />
at the Time of Restoration for the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>All of the aforementioned items of the issue of Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing were fulfilled at the Maccabees&rsquo; time, and they will be much more fulfilled in glory at the time of restoration for the kingdom of God (Matt. 19:28; Rev. 11:15). The Maccabees, taking Mount Zion as their ground to judge Edom, gained a victory over Antiochus Epiphanes about 165 B.C. The victory of the Maccabees was a type of the victory Israel will gain immediately before the age of restoration.</p>
<p>The Minor Prophets, including Obadiah, reveal that the nations used by God to chastise sinful Israel do something in excess. Therefore, God will come in to judge the nations. This judgment will issue in Israel&rsquo;s gaining the victory and enlarging their territory for the kingdom of God on earth, especially for God&rsquo;s kingdom in the time of restoration.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON JONAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S CARE AND SALVATION<br />
TO THE MOST EVIL CITY OF THE GENTILES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Jonah 1&mdash;4</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the book of Jonah. Among the books of the Minor Prophets, Jonah stands alone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>Jonah 1:1-2 is the introductory word to this book.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Jonah</h2>
<p>Jonah in Hebrew means &ldquo;dove&rdquo; (v. 1). This signifies that God wanted Jonah to go out as a dove to preach the gospel of peace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Jonah&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Jonah&rsquo;s ministry was about 862 B.C., at the time of the prophet Elisha (896-838 B.C.).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the people of the great city of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry also was Nineveh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The subject of Jonah&rsquo;s ministry was that Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation reached even to the Gentile city Nineveh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of the book of Jonah is that God cared for and saved even the most evil Gentiles in His pity on men and cattle.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In the book of Jonah, the revelation concerning Christ is in Jonah&rsquo;s being a type of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. In Jonah&rsquo;sTypifying Christ<br />
Preaching the Gospel of Peace to the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Christ is revealed in Jonah&rsquo;s typifying Christ preaching the gospel of peace to the Gentiles (3:2; Matt. 12:41). Jonah was a prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles. In this he was a type of Christ, who turned from Israel to the Gentiles (Luke 4:25-27; Matt. 21:43).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In Jonah&rsquo;s Staying in the Great Fish<br />
Three Days and Three Nights</h2>
<p>Christ is revealed also in the type of Jonah&rsquo;s staying in the great fish three days and three nights (Jonah 1:17). This typifies Christ&rsquo;s staying in the heart of the earth three days and three nights (Matt. 12:40). Christ died and entered into the heart of the earth. He came forth from there in resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) for the preaching, the spreading, of the gospel to all the Gentile nations, as seen in the book of Acts.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Jonah has five sections: the introductory word (1:1-2); Jonah&rsquo;s fleeing from Jehovah&rsquo;s commission (1:2-17); Jonah&rsquo;s repenting (ch. 2); Jonah&rsquo;s preaching (ch. 3); and Jonah&rsquo;s prejudice (ch. 4).</p><h2 class="head1">II. JONAH&rsquo;S FLEEING FROM JEHOVAH&rsquo;S COMMISSION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah&rsquo;s Commission</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s commission was for Jonah to go and cry out against the evil of Nineveh (1:2). God intended to judge Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, but He also intended to extend His salvation of love to that evil Gentile city. For this reason He commissioned Jonah to go to Nineveh to cry out against the city.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jonah&rsquo;s Fleeing to Tarshish<br />
from the Presence of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Jonah did not agree with God. Jonah knew that God was &ldquo;a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and great in lovingkindness and repentant of evil&rdquo; (4:2) and that God would change His mind and not judge Nineveh if the city repented. Anticipating this, Jonah rose up to flee by ship to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah (1:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah&rsquo;s Interruption</h2>
<p>In verses 4 through 17 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s interruption. As the sovereign God, He raised up a storm. He caused a great tempest on the sea, and the ship was about to be broken up (v. 4). Jonah had gone down into the innermost part of the vessel and had lain down and had fallen fast asleep (v. 5b). Eventually, it was found out by the casting of lots that Jonah was responsible for the storm (vv. 7-14). At Jonah&rsquo;s request, the mariners cast him into the sea (vv. 15-16). Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah up, and he was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Type of Christ</h2>
<p>As we have pointed out, Jonah here was a type of Christ, who was sent by God to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, with Jonah&rsquo;s staying in the great fish three days and three nights typifying Christ&rsquo;s staying in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. JONAH&rsquo;S REPENTING</h2>
<p>After three days and three nights in the stomach of the fish, Jonah prayed and repented to Jehovah. Chapter two is the record of Jonah&rsquo;s repenting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jonah&rsquo;s Prayer to Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 2 through 9 are Jonah&rsquo;s prayer to Jehovah. Jonah prayed in a very strange way, saying such things as this: &ldquo;Water encompassed me, even to my soul; / The deep surrounded me; / Seaweed was wrapped about my head&rdquo; (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah Commanding the Fish</h2>
<p>Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto the dry land (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. JONAH&rsquo;S PREACHING</h2>
<p>Chapter three covers the matter of Jonah&rsquo;s preaching.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah&rsquo;s Commission to Jonah<br />
 the Second Time, and Jonah&rsquo;s Preaching<br />
to the Great City Nineveh</h2>
<p>After Jonah was adjusted, corrected, and subdued, he was willing to go along with God and take His commission. &ldquo;Then the word of Jehovah came to Jonah a second time, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city; and proclaim to it the proclamation that I will speak to you&rdquo; (3:1-2). Jonah arose, went to Nineveh according to the word of Jehovah, and preached, crying out and saying, &ldquo;Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overturned&rdquo; (vv. 3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The People and the King of Nineveh<br />
Believing God, Proclaiming a Fast, and Repenting</h2>
<p>The people and the king of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and repented (vv. 5-9). In his proclamation the king declared, &ldquo;Let man and beast be covered in sackcloth, and let them call to God strongly. And let each turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. Who knows whether God will turn and repent and will turn from His burning anger so that we do not perish?&rdquo; (vv. 8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. God Repenting and Not Doing the Evil to Them</h2>
<p>God saw their deeds, repented, and would not do the evil to them (v. 10). As a result, the whole city was saved.</p><h2 class="head1">V. JONAH&rsquo;S PREJUDICE</h2>
<p>Chapter four of this book exposes Jonah&rsquo;s prejudice. When God changed His mind and forgave the people of Nineveh, Jonah was angry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah&rsquo;s Turning from Doing Evil<br />
to Nineveh Displeasing Jonah Greatly,<br />
and Jonah Praying to Jehovah in His Anger</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s turning from doing evil to Nineveh displeased Jonah greatly, and Jonah prayed to Jehovah in his anger (4:1-4). As he prayed, Jonah said, &ldquo;Ah, Jehovah, was this not what I said when I was still in my land? Therefore I anticipated it by fleeing to Tarshish, for I know that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and great in lovingkindness and repentant of evil&rdquo; (v. 2). Jonah could not tolerate the fact that, after charging him to preach that the city of Nineveh would be overthrown, God changed His mind. Jonah could not go along with God in this, but was actually angry with God because of it.</p>
<p>How could a man dare to be angry with God? Jonah should have said, &ldquo;God is sovereign, and what happens to Nineveh is up to Him. He said that He would destroy Nineveh, but whether or not Nineveh is destroyed is up to Him. It does not matter to me if He repents, if He changes His mind.&rdquo; However, instead of having such an attitude, Jonah was so angry that he said, &ldquo;Jehovah, take my life, I pray, from me, for it is better for me to die than to live&rdquo; (v. 3). When he said this, Jehovah replied, &ldquo;Do you do well to be angry?&rdquo; (v. 4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Lesson of the Castor-oil Tree</h2>
<p>In verses 5 through 11 we have the lesson of the castor-oil tree. Jonah went out from the city, made a booth for himself, and sat under it in the shade to see what would happen to the city. Then God prepared a castor-oil tree, and it came up over Jonah to be a shade over his head. Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the tree. But God prepared a worm, and it struck the tree so that it withered. Furthermore, when the sun rose, God prepared a sultry east wind. The sun beat down on Jonah&rsquo;s head, and he requested that he might die. When God asked Jonah if he did well in being angry about the tree, Jonah said that he did well to be angry unto death. Then Jehovah said to him, &ldquo;You had pity on the tree that you did not labor for nor cause to grow, which came into being overnight and perished overnight; and I, should I not have pity on Nineveh, the great city, in which are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people, who cannot discern between their right hand and their left, and many cattle?&rdquo; (vv. 10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. God&rsquo;s Pity on the Most Evil City<br />
of the Gentiles</h2>
<p>In verse 11 we see God&rsquo;s pity on the most evil city of the Gentiles; He cared even for their cattle. Nineveh was built by the evil man Nimrod in Assyria (Gen. 10:8-11). Assyria was the country that invaded and insulted Israel about 713 B.C. (Isa. 36), after the time of Jonah. God had pity on such an evil city.</p>
<p>In Matthew 12:40 the Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, a group of &ldquo;Jonahs,&rdquo; that He would be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights, just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish, for the extending of God&rsquo;s salvation from the Jews to the Gentiles. This indicates that God is not only the God of the Jews but also the God of all the nations. The Jews thought that they were the unique people of God. They considered themselves the firstborn son (Luke 15:25-32) with the right to be the first to enjoy all that is of God. But because the Jews responded to God wrongly, the Gentiles, not the Jews, became the first to enjoy God in His salvation.</p>
<p>The book of Jonah indicates particularly that God is not the God of only a certain people; He is the God of all peoples. After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, in Acts 13 God told Paul and Barnabas to go to the Gentiles (vv. 46-47). They were not like Jonah; rather, they took God&rsquo;s commission and went and preached the gospel throughout Asia Minor. Then the Spirit led them to go from Asia to Europe, to Macedonia (16:6-10). The book of Jonah shows us that while God was angry with Assyria, He would still be gracious and compassionate toward a great and sinful city such as Nineveh. This indicates that God&rsquo;s economy is to do things through these two factors&mdash;the consuming factor and the suffering factor&mdash;to extend His salvation to all the peoples on earth.</p>
 <p>God&rsquo;s economy to manifest Christ implies the extending of His salvation in Christ to reach even the distant, great, evil cities of the Gentiles. I consider Russia as today&lsquo;s Nineveh. What we are doing in Russia is altogether under the span of God&rsquo;s economy. I believe that we will receive much blessing because this is according to God&rsquo;s economy. Thus, the consuming locusts are still consuming, the suffering Israel is still suffering, and the Lord is still going on in His recovery.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON MICAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INTRODUCTORY WORD<br />
AND<br />
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S REPROOF ON ISRAEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Micah 1:1&mdash;2:11; 3:1-12</h1>
<p>The Minor Prophets reveal that God uses the Gentiles as a means, an instrument, to chastise His elect, Israel. The Gentiles, however, do things in excess, and this offends God, who then comes in to punish the Gentiles. God&rsquo;s chastisement of Israel and His punishment of the Gentiles issue in the manifestation of Christ, and the manifestation of Christ brings in the restoration, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth. All the Minor Prophets have this same basic thought, although they use different expressions to convey it. In Micah the expressions are very poetic. The entire book of Micah is a book of poetry.</p>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the prophecy of Micah, covering the introductory word and Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>The introductory word is in 1:1.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Micah</h2>
<p>Micah is a shortened form of Micaiah, meaning &ldquo;Who is like Jah?&rdquo; &ldquo;Jah&rdquo; is a shortened form of Jehovah. The longer form of the prophet&rsquo;s name is found in the Hebrew text of Jeremiah 26:18.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Micah&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Micah&rsquo;s ministry was about 750-710 B.C., at the time of Isaiah and Hosea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the northern kingdom of Israel (also Judah). In the Old Testament, the term <em>Israel</em> is used for two matters: the whole race of Israel and the northern kingdom of Israel. Because the term is used in these two ways, it is sometimes difficult for us as readers to know whether it refers to the northern kingdom of Israel or to the entire people of Israel. Here it refers to the whole race of Israel, including Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Micah is Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on Israel and His restoration of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Micah is that Jehovah reproved Israel of her evils and promised her His saving and gathering of her remnant for the restoration (Matt. 19:28) in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In Micah the revelation concerning Christ is very strong. Christ is revealed in His eternal origin (5:2c); in His human birth in Bethlehem (5:2a); in His being the Ruler, the Shepherd, and the peace of Israel in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; Micah 5:2b, 4a, 5a); in His becoming great (5:4b); and in His saving Israel from Assyria (5:6b).</p>
<p>Micah 5:4b says that in the millennium Christ will be great unto the ends of the earth. Daniel 2:34 and 35 tell us that Christ as a stone cut out without hands will crush the great human image and will then become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, and fill the whole earth. Today, apparently Jesus is very small, but in the coming kingdom He will become great.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Micah has five sections: the introductory word (1:1); Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on Israel (1:2&mdash;2:11; 3:1-12); Jehovah&rsquo;s comfort to Israel (2:12-13; 4:1&mdash;5:15); Jehovah&rsquo;s contention with Israel (6:1-16); and the prophet&rsquo;s observation and expectation (7:1-20).</p><h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S REPROOF ON ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Let us now consider Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah&rsquo;s Coming in Judgment<br />
from His Holy Temple</h2>
<p>In verse 2 the prophet tells the peoples to hear and the earth to give heed and let the Lord Jehovah be a witness against them, the Lord from His holy temple. Then, indicating that Jehovah is coming in judgment from His holy temple, the prophet continues, &ldquo;For behold, Jehovah comes forth from His place, / And He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. / And the mountains will be melted under Him, / And the valleys will be cleft, / Like wax before fire, / Like water poured down a slope&rdquo; (vv. 3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Cause</h2>
<p>The cause of Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on Israel is found in verse 5. Here the prophet says, &ldquo;All this is because of the transgression of Jacob / And because of the sins of the house of Israel. / What is the transgression of Jacob? / Is it not Samaria? / And what are the high places of Judah? / Are they not Jerusalem?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Destruction of Samaria</h2>
<p>According to verse 6, Samaria will be made a heap of ruins in a field, places for the planting of vineyards. Verse 7 goes on to say, &ldquo;All her engraved idols will be smashed, / And all her gifts for harlotry will be burned with fire, / And all her images I will make a desolation; / For from the harlot&rsquo;s hire she has gathered them, / And unto the harlot&rsquo;s hire they will return.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Invasion of Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Verses 8 and 9 are concerned with the invasion of Jerusalem. Here the prophet declares, &ldquo;Because of this I will wail and howl; / I will go about barefoot and naked. / I will make a wailing like the jackals / And a lamentation like the ostriches. / For her wounds are incurable, / For it has come as far as Judah; / It reaches as far as the gate of my people, / As far as Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Terrors in Judah and Israel<br />
and the Evils from Jehovah</h2>
<p>In the remainder of chapter one (vv. 10-16), we have an account of the terrors in Judah and Israel and the evils from Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Jehovah&rsquo;s Reproof on Israel&rsquo;s Evils</h2>
<p>Micah 2:1-11 is a record of Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on Israel&rsquo;s evils.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Jehovah&rsquo;s Reproof on the Heads<br />
and Rulers of the House of Israel</h2>
<p>Micah 3:1-11 describes Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on the heads and rulers of the house of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Destruction of Jerusalem and Mount Zion</h2>
<p>Finally, verse 12 speaks regarding the destruction of Jerusalem and Mount Zion. &ldquo;Therefore on account of you / Zion will be plowed as a field, / And Jerusalem will be heaps, / And the mountain of the house will become the high places of a forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Minor Prophets touched the same thing&mdash;God&rsquo;s chastisement over Israel and His punishment on the nations issuing in the manifestation of Christ for the restoration of the whole universe, consummating in the new heaven and new earth. This shows that in the consideration of the godly people, mainly the prophets, there was the expectation that the Messiah would come to restore not only the kingdom of Israel but also the entire universe, especially the sun, the moon, and the stars, for the growing of the living things on the earth, that the earth might be very rich in produce. Isaiah 30:26 says that in the restoration &ldquo;the light of the sun will be sevenfold,&rdquo; not for scorching but for shining, for giving sunshine to grow the living things on earth. This means that the heavens will answer the earth and cause it to grow things in a rich way (Hosea 2:21-22). The sun&rsquo;s shining seven times brighter indicates that the produce of the earth will be seven times richer than it is today. At that time there will be no scarcity but rather plenitude.</p>
<p>Before Adam fell, the earth was rich in produce. Man did not need to labor with sweating. However, after man fell, God came in to curse the earth and to tell man that he would eat of the earth by the sweat of his brow (Gen. 3:17-19). But in the age of restoration, &ldquo;the mountains will drop down fresh wine, / And the hills will flow with milk&rdquo; (Joel 3:18). Since there will be no poverty or scarcity, there will be no need for the various &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; such as communism and capitalism, to exist in order to balance the social wealth. Like the birds (Matt. 6:25-26), the people on earth will partake of all the natural resources of the earth in a common way. In the restoration there will be no merchants (Zech. 14:21b, where &ldquo;Canaanite&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;merchant&rdquo;), no money (mammon, Luke 16:9), no buying and selling, no police stations, and no law courts. Christ will be there as the source of the rich supply, as the inner law of life, and as everything for us to enjoy.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON MICAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S COMFORT TO ISRAEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Micah 2:12-13; 4:1&mdash;5:15</h1>
<p>We have emphasized the fact that all the minor prophets speak the same thing in different ways, from different angles, and in different aspects. Thus, Micah also speaks the same thing as the other minor prophets, but he speaks it in his own particular way.</p>
<p>In the foregoing message we covered the introductory word and Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof on Israel. Micah 1 reveals that Jehovah is coming forth out of His temple to exercise His judgment upon sinful Israel. Verses 3 and 4 portray the terrible judgment that is coming. &ldquo;Jehovah comes forth from His place, / And He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. / And the mountains will be melted under Him, / And the valleys will be cleft, / Like wax before fire, / Like water poured down a slope.&rdquo; Because of this judgment, the prophet wailed and howled, and some of the people also wailed (vv. 9-16). The next two chapters, part of Jehovah&rsquo;s reproof, are a description of the sinfulness of the house of Jacob and the house of Judah.</p>
<p>In this message we will consider Jehovah&rsquo;s comfort to Israel. This comfort is actually a matter of restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S COMFORT TO ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s comfort to Israel is found in 2:12-13 and 4:1&mdash;5:15.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Restoration of Israel in the Millennium</h2>
<p>Micah 4:1-5 concerns the restoration of Israel (Matt. 19:28) in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; Isa. 2:2-5). At that time the people will no longer learn war (Micah 4:3), but, enjoying life without disturbance, &ldquo;they will each sit underneath his vine / And underneath his fig tree, / And no one will disturb them&rdquo; (v. 4). Each one will eat and drink for his enjoyment in peace. This eating and drinking will be a kind of worship to God.</p>
<p>The thousand years of the millennium will be a continual feast. According to the Old Testament, during the yearly feasts the children of Israel were charged not to work (Lev. 23:7, 8, 35). To work during those feasts would have been an insult to God. The people were only to rest, eat, drink, and enjoy their life before God. Their eating and drinking were their worship to God. According to the New Testament, at the Lord&rsquo;s table on the first day of the week, we put aside our work, we rest in the Lord, and we eat and drink Christ to enjoy Him and to let Him enjoy our satisfaction. This is the top worship to God, and this is the Christian life&mdash;a restful life for worship. God is seeking such worshippers (John 4:23-24). We have been called not to work and to labor but to worship. Every day and every night we should worship God by enjoying Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah&rsquo;s Gathering<br />
of the Remnant of the People</h2>
<p>In His comfort to Israel Jehovah will gather the remnant of the people (2:12-13; 4:6-8). In 2:12 Jehovah promises to gather all of Jacob and assemble the remnant of Israel. In 4:6 and 7 He says that He will gather her that limps and collect her that has been driven out and her that He has afflicted, and He will make her that limps a remnant and her that has been cast far away, a mighty nation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Israel to Be Captured<br />
and Jehovah&rsquo;s Deliverance to Israel</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s comfort to Israel also includes His deliverance to Israel after Israel is captured (4:9-13; 5:1). This means that God will meet every need and solve every problem.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">D. Christ to Come<br />
as Israel&rsquo;s Ruler, Shepherd, and Peace</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 is a prophecy concerning Christ. This verse says that His &ldquo;goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; His &ldquo;goings forth&rdquo; are His coming out. To the angels it is His going forth, but to us it is His coming out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His goings forth are...from the days of eternity&rdquo; means that in eternity, before the creation of the earth, Christ was preparing to come forth. His appearing, His manifestation, began in eternity. From the ancient times, from the days of eternity, the Triune God was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time, to come with His divinity into humanity. His creation of all things was His preparation to come out of eternity into time. This was the purpose of creation. Then while the locusts were operating (Joel 1:4; 2:25), Christ came forth. In eternity Christ was concealed in His divinity, but through incarnation He came forth with His divinity into humanity.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s going forth, His appearing, is a continuous matter. From the time of His incarnation, He began to come forth, and His coming forth is still taking place today. Christ&rsquo;s coming forth will be consummated when He throws Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-20), when Satan is cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:2-3), and when Christ sets up His throne to reign as King (Matt. 25:31, 34, 40). At that time His appearing will be complete. But today He is still on the way.</p>
<p>While Christ is on the way, He is taking care of the scattered Jews. On the one hand, Israel is under God&rsquo;s chastisement; on the other hand, Israel is also under God&rsquo;s shepherding care. This shepherding is His preservation of Israel.</p>
<p>In the restoration Christ will be the Ruler, Shepherd, and peace to His elect, Israel (Micah 5:2-5a). Today, in His goings forth, He is our Ruler, Shepherd, and peace. As our Ruler, He keeps us; as our Shepherd, He nourishes and cherishes us; and as our peace, He controls our environment so that we may enjoy Him.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Israel to Be Invaded by Assyria<br />
and Saved by Christ</h2>
<p>&ldquo;When Assyria comes into our land / And when he treads in our palaces, / We will raise up against him seven shepherds / And eight princes of men. / And they will waste the land of Assyria with the sword / And the land of Nimrod at its entrances. / And He will save us from Assyria, / When he comes into our land / And when he treads in our border&rdquo; (vv. 5b-6). These verses reveal that Christ also will save Israel after they are invaded by Assyria. The coming Christ will take the full responsibility to deal with all of human government, represented by Assyria and Nimrod.</p>
<p>The mentioning of Assyria and Nimrod in these verses is a reminder of the beginning of the locusts, a reminder of when and how the locusts were produced. For the Lord to deal with the Assyrians means that He deals with the first group of the locusts, and this indicates that He will go on to deal with all the locusts.</p>
<p>Here we need to consider once again the great human image in Daniel 2, with its head of gold (Babylon), its breast and its arms of silver (Medo-Persia), its abdomen and its thighs of bronze (Greece), its legs of iron (Rome), and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay (vv. 32-33). The smashing of this image by the stone cut out without hands (Christ) begins not with the head but with the feet. According to verse 34, this stone will strike the image at its feet and crush them. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold will be crushed all at once, and the stone will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth (v. 35). The point here is that the smashing of the feet, which signify Antichrist, involves the smashing of the entire image, signifying the destruction of human government from Assyria and Babylon to Rome. It is significant that Micah speaks of Assyria and Nimrod, the founder of Nineveh (the capital of Assyria) and Babel (Gen. 10:8-11). Actually, Assyria equals Rome, and Nimrod equals Antichrist.</p>
<p>Eventually, Israel will be invaded by Antichrist and his armies. Having collected his evil world powers, Antichrist will besiege the city of Jerusalem, with the intention of putting it to an end. At this juncture Christ will come to destroy Antichrist and his armies and to save Israel. At that time, the great image will be crushed by the stone cut out without hands; Assyria, Nimrod, the empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, and Antichrist will be no more; and the entire earth will become the kingdom of God for eternity. Then all of Jehovah&rsquo;s elect will enjoy Him. This is His comfort to Israel, a comfort that is a matter of restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Remnant of Jacob<br />
to Be Blessed by Jehovah<br />
and Victorious among the Nations</h2>
<p>After Christ deals with all the enemies, the remnant of Jacob will be blessed by Jehovah, and they also will be victorious among the nations. Concerning this, Micah 5:7 and 8 say that the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from Jehovah, like abundant showers, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, and like a young lion among the flocks of sheep. Regarding the remnant of Jacob, the prophet goes on to say, &ldquo;Your hand will be raised up against your adversaries, / And all your enemies will be cut off&rdquo; (v. 9). Some may find it hard to believe that the small nation of Israel will be victorious among the nations, but this is clearly prophesied in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Jehovah&rsquo;s Clearing Up<br />
of the Armies, Cities, Strongholds, Witchcraft,<br />
Idols, and Idol Worship from Israel<br />
and His Executing of Vengeance upon the Nations</h2>
<p>Eventually, Jehovah will clear up the armies, cities, strongholds, witchcraft, idols, and idol worship from Israel, and He will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations, in the day of restoration (vv. 10-15).</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON MICAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHETS<br />
IN THEIR SPEAKING CONCERNING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Micah 5:2-9; Amos 9:11-15</h1>
<p>In this message I would like to give a word on the greatness of the prophets in their speaking concerning Christ. When Micah and the other prophets spoke concerning Christ, they were touching great things. However, when they turned from Christ to their own observations regarding the condition and situation of God&rsquo;s people, they became small.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING NIMROD AND ASSYRIA<br />
IN RELATION TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>In his prophecy concerning Christ, Micah says, &ldquo;His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity&rdquo; (5:2). Then he goes on to say that this One, who is Israel&rsquo;s Ruler and Shepherd, will be the peace when Assyria comes into the land (v. 5). In verse 6 the prophet first speaks of the land of Assyria and the land of Nimrod, and then, prophesying about Christ, declares, &ldquo;He will save us from Assyria.&rdquo; In these verses we can see Nimrod and Assyria as they are related to Christ.</p>
<p>Human government began with Nimrod, the first type of Antichrist. According to Genesis 10:10 and 11, Nimrod built the cities of Babel and Nineveh. Babel issued in Babylon, the height of human government (Dan. 2:31-45) and the first stage of the locusts, that is, the cutting locusts (Joel 1:4). Human government, including the empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, has been used by God to carry out His work of the chastisement of Israel. Eventually, the entire human government&mdash;the four kinds of locusts mentioned in Joel 1 and the four sections of the great image described in Daniel 2&mdash;will be smashed by a single stone, Christ as the stone cut out without hands that will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth (Dan. 2:34-35). In this way Christ will save Israel from Assyria.</p>
<p>Regarding the four locusts in Joel, the Lord has given us a bright revelation. This enlightenment, this shining, opens not only the Bible but the entire history of the world. Furthermore, this revelation opens up God&rsquo;s eternal economy, for the four stages of the locusts occupy a great part of God&rsquo;s economy in relation to mankind. It may be that before too long the locusts will be destroyed and, as Hosea 6:2 prophesies, dormant Israel will be raised up on the third day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPHETS TURNING<br />
FROM CHRIST TO SMALL THINGS</h2>
<p>The prophets are great in their speaking about Christ but not in their speaking about other things. We may use Micah and Amos as examples. On the one hand, they both prophesied concerning Christ; on the other hand, they both spoke about such a small thing as deceitful balances. Amos said that the corrupt people made the ephah small and the shekel large and falsified the balances for deceit (8:5). Concerning this, Micah said, &ldquo;Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, / And a scant measure that is abominable? / Shall I be pure with wicked balances / And with a bag of deceitful weights?&rdquo; (6:10-11). Both prophets observed that the people used one measure for buying and a different measure for selling and that their weights and balances were deceitful. The word of Amos and Micah about such a small matter cannot compare with the greatness of their word concerning Christ.</p>
<p>The prophet Joel differs from Micah and Amos in that he did not speak regarding small things. Rather, in just three chapters he spoke concerning five great matters: (1) the four kinds of locusts (1:4); (2) the outpouring of the Spirit (2:28-32); (3) the coming of Christ with all the mighty ones to defeat Antichrist with his armies to change this age (3:11, 13); (4) the judging of all the living nations to separate the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; from the &ldquo;goats&rdquo; (3:2, 12; cf. Matt. 25:31-46); and (5) Christ&rsquo;s reigning among Israel in the millennial kingdom (Joel 3:16-17, 21b).</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHETS, NOT PSALMISTS</h2>
<p>In contrast, Amos and Micah used many more chapters than Joel to speak of things other than Christ. When these prophets spoke concerning Christ, they spoke great things, but when they expressed their own natural concept and opinion, they were like some of the psalmists. For instance, Micah 6:8 says, &ldquo;He has declared to you, O man, what is good; / And what does Jehovah require of you, / But that you would execute justice and love lovingkindness / And walk humbly with your God?&rdquo; Is this word according to the tree of life or according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Surely it is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Is this word according to the divine revelation or according to the human concept of the prophet? This word is not a matter of God&rsquo;s revelation but of the prophet&rsquo;s concept.</p>
<p>My concern here actually is not with the shortcomings of these prophets but with our situation today. I am concerned that some of us may take the four governing principles, or the four factors, we have seen in the Minor Prophets and use them in a critical way to examine others in the church, especially the elders. Those who do this may be like certain of the psalmists, but they are not prophets speaking for God.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul encouraged us to be prophets, not psalmists (vv. 24, 31). If we express our concept or opinion, we are like some of the psalmists. To prophesy is not only to speak for Christ but also to speak forth Christ and even to speak Christ. If we have an opinion or concept, that opinion or concept must be Christ. We should have no heart to express our opinion. Our burden, desire, intention, and goal should be just to speak Christ. I can testify that my aim in all the messages I put out is to speak Christ and Christ alone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AMOS&rsquo;S AND MICAH&rsquo;S GREATNESS<br />
IN THEIR PROPHESYING CONCERNING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In their prophesying concerning Christ, Amos and Micah are great.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Amos&rsquo;s Prophecy concerning Christ&rsquo;s<br />
Rebuilding the Fallen Tabernacle of David</h2>
<p>Amos is great in his prophecy concerning Christ&rsquo;s rebuilding the fallen tabernacle of David. In Amos 9:11 the prophet says, &ldquo;In that day I will raise up / The fallen tabernacle of David, / And I will wall up its breaches / And raise up its ruins / And build it up as it was in the days of old.&rdquo; We have seen that the tabernacle of David is the kingdom of David and the royal family of David. The kingdom of David was a type of the coming kingdom of Christ. When Christ comes back, He will rebuild, that is, restore and recover, the kingdom of His forefather David and fully make the kingdom of David the kingdom of Christ and of God for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Micah&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Goings Forth of Christ</h2>
<p>Micah&rsquo;s prophecy concerning the goings forth of the all-inclusive Christ is a great matter. In this prophecy Christ is all-inclusive because He will be the Ruler, the Shepherd, and the peace of Israel, and He will also bring forth the seven shepherds and the eight princes (5:2-5).</p>
<p>Christ came forth from Bethlehem, a small town called &ldquo;David&rsquo;s city&rdquo; (Luke 2:4). However, His goings forth were not from time but from eternity. In eternity past He selected us and predestinated us (Eph. 1:4-5). When He was doing these things, He considered how He would come. If He had only selected and predestinated us without preparing to come out of eternity, He could do nothing with us. Whatever He will do and can do for us depends on His coming forth. He came in incarnation, and He went on through human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and the outpouring of the consummated Spirit, who is the reality of Christ Himself. All these are great steps in Christ&rsquo;s going forth. His going forth has not stopped but is continuing today.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Micah 6&mdash;7</h1>
<p>In chapter five Micah reaches the high peak of his prophecy concerning Christ. Then in chapters six and seven, which we will cover in this message, he descends to a much lower plain. His prophecy in chapter five is great, but his prophecy in chapters six and seven is not great but is very much according to the human concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S CONTENDING WITH ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Micah 6 is a record of Jehovah&rsquo;s contending with Israel. Because contending is a matter of fighting by speaking, it is not pleasant for anyone involved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Taking Israel&rsquo;s History as a Base</h2>
<p>In His contending with Israel, Jehovah took Israel&rsquo;s history, from the time of the exodus, as a base (vv. 1-5). Verse 2b declares that Jehovah has a contention with His people and that He will dispute with Israel. Then He asks them to remember what He did for them in bringing them out of Egypt. &ldquo;For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, / And from the slave house I redeemed you; / And I sent before you Moses, / Aaron, and Miriam. / O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab counseled, / And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, / From Shittim to Gilgal, / That you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah&rdquo; (vv. 4-5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Aspiring after Israel&rsquo;s<br />
Genuine Worship and Sincere Service</h2>
<p>Verses 6 through 8 reveal that Jehovah aspired after Israel&rsquo;s genuine worship and sincere service. Israel had been busy in the worship of God for centuries, but their worship was not genuine. Much of what they offered was not offered to God but either to themselves or to their idols. Thus, in verse 6 the prophet asks with what he should come before Jehovah, saying, &ldquo;Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, / With one-year-old calves?&rdquo; In verse 7 he asks if Jehovah would be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil, and then he says, &ldquo;Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, / The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?&rdquo; God would never require anyone to offer their children as a sacrifice, but the people of Israel actually did this in order to fulfill the requirements of their idols. Only idol worshippers would make sacrifices of their children. Here Jehovah was contending with Israel concerning their idol worship and their offering sacrifices to idols. For this reason, in verse 8 Micah prophesies, saying, &ldquo;He has declared to you, O man, what is good; / And what does Jehovah require of you, / But that you would execute justice and love lovingkindness / And walk humbly with your God?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Stating the Cause and the Effect</h2>
<p>In verses 9 through 16 we have the stating of the cause and the effect. The cause is Israel&rsquo;s sins, and the effect is Jehovah&rsquo;s punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE PROPHET&rsquo;S<br />
OBSERVATION AND EXPECTATION</h2>
<p>Chapter seven speaks of the prophet Micah&rsquo;s observation and expectation. His observation involved a close study and examination of the condition and situation of God&rsquo;s people. His expectation was related to his attempt to find something with which he could encourage himself. Much of what he says in this chapter is an expression of his natural sentiment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Prophet&rsquo;s Observation of Discouragement</h2>
<p>First, the prophet observed the condition and situation of God&rsquo;s chosen people and became fully discouraged (vv. 1-6). In his discouragement he said, &ldquo;Woe is me! For I am like a gathering of summer fruit / And like a gleaning of the vintage; / There is no cluster to eat, / Nor first-ripe fig, which my soul desires. / The godly man has perished from the land, / And there is none upright among men; / They all lie in wait for bloodshed; / They each hunt their brother with a net&rdquo; (vv. 1-2).</p>
<p>In Micah&rsquo;s observation of discouragement there is a lesson for us today. From Micah&rsquo;s experience we should learn not to look at ourselves. If we look at ourselves just a little, we will be discouraged.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Prophet&rsquo;s Expectation of Encouragement</h2>
<p>In verses 7 through 20 we have the prophet&rsquo;s expectation of encouragement. Actually, this was a matter of self-comforting. Micah wrote the things found in these verses in order to comfort himself. Thus, they were Micah&rsquo;s self-comforting.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Taking the Lead<br />
to Look for Jehovah and Wait for God</h2>
<p>After observing the poor situation of the people of Israel, the prophet took the lead to look for Jehovah and wait for God (vv. 7-10). Although the condition and situation of God&rsquo;s people caused Micah to be discouraged, he could still say, &ldquo;But as for me, I will look for Jehovah; / I will wait for the God of my salvation; / My God will hear me&rdquo; (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Assuring Israel of Her Restoration</h2>
<p>In verses 11 through 13 Micah assured Israel of her restoration. First, he said that there will be a day for the building of Israel&rsquo;s walls (v. 11a). Then he went on to assure Israel, saying, &ldquo;In that day they will come even unto you / From Assyria and from the cities of Egypt, / And from Egypt even to the River, / And from sea to sea and mountain to mountain&rdquo; (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Asking Jehovah to Feed His People Israel</h2>
<p>In verses 14 through 17 the prophet asks Jehovah to feed His people Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Thanking God for His Forgiveness<br />
of the Remnant of the People</h2>
<p>The prophet concludes by thanking God for His forgiveness of the remnant of the people (vv. 18-20). Micah could not praise God that the condition and situation of His people were wonderful, for they had nothing that He could appreciate. Instead, the prophet said, &ldquo;Who is a God like You, / Pardoning iniquity / And passing over the transgression / Of the remnant of His inheritance? / He does not retain His anger forever, / For He delights in lovingkindness&rdquo; (v. 18). Here Micah seemed to be saying, &ldquo;O God, all we have is sin and iniquity. We do not have anything to give to You. But You are a God who pardons our iniquity. There is no God like You. You are also very particular in that You do not retain Your anger forever but delight in lovingkindness.&rdquo; Micah&rsquo;s praise here is centered not on the virtues of God&rsquo;s elect people but on God&rsquo;s attributes. Such a praise is very comforting.</p>
<p>In verse 19 the prophet continues, &ldquo;He will again have compassion on us; / He will tread our iniquities underfoot. / And You will cast into the depths of the sea / All their sins.&rdquo; Once again, Micah confesses that the people have many iniquities but that God is a forgiving God and will tread their iniquities under foot and cast their sins into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p>Finally, Micah says, &ldquo;You will perform truth to Jacob, / And lovingkindness to Abraham, / Which You have sworn to our fathers / From the days of old&rdquo; (v. 20). Here we see Micah&rsquo;s hope and expectation.</p>
<p>In a sense, Micah&rsquo;s word in chapters six and seven is good, but it cannot compare with his revelation concerning Christ in chapter five.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON NAHUM</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENT ON NINEVEH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Nahum 1&mdash;3</h1>
<p>The book of Nahum is the opposite of the book of Jonah. Both books deal with the city of Nineveh, but whereas Jonah brought, or extended, God&rsquo;s salvation to that sinful city, Nahum brought God&rsquo;s judgment upon Nineveh. Jonah reveals that God in His salvation is the God of all the peoples of the earth, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles. Nahum reveals that God is also the God of all peoples in His judgment. Thus, God is the God of all peoples both in judgment and in salvation.</p>
<p>The book of Nahum shows us why God judges a city. In this book we see both the fact and the cause of God&rsquo;s judgment on Nineveh. God extended His salvation to Nineveh, but Nineveh was sinful and invaded Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>In Nahum 1:1 we have the introductory word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Nahum</h2>
<p>In Hebrew Nahum means &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; and &ldquo;avenge,&rdquo; signifying that Jehovah God comforts His elect, Israel, and avenges Israel of her enemy, Nineveh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Nahum&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Nahum&rsquo;s ministry was about 713 B.C. That was the year in which Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, invaded Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of Nahum&rsquo;s ministry was the southern kingdom of Judah. History tells us that Nahum grew up in Galilee, in a town called Elkosha, which is near Capernaum. The name <em>Capernaum</em> may mean &ldquo;the city of Nahum,&rdquo; indicating that it had much to do with Nahum. Although Nahum was a northerner, the place of his ministry was in the south.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of Nahum&rsquo;s ministry was the great city of Nineveh. The cities of Babel and Nineveh were built by Nimrod (Gen. 10:8-11) and became the capitals of the nations of Babylon and Assyria. Nimrod, the first type of Antichrist, was the first to oppose God, and both of these nations were strong figures of mankind in their opposing of God. Actually, Assyria was the first nation to come and devastate Israel, invading Israel in 713 B.C. (2 Kings 18:13&mdash;19:37), more than one hundred years before the Babylonian invasion in 606 B.C.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the book of Nahum is Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Nineveh as the capital of the evil Assyria.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Nahum is that Jehovah judged Assyria, avenging Israel of her enemy to restore her for her comfort.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Nahum has three sections: the introductory word (1:1); Jehovah as the majestic Judge (1:2-7); and Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Nineveh (1:8&mdash;3:19).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH AS THE MAJESTIC JUDGE</h2>
<p>In 1:2-7 Jehovah is revealed as the majestic Judge. First, we see that Jehovah is the Judge and then we see the majesty of Jehovah as the Judge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah as the Judge</h2>
<p>As the Judge, Jehovah is a jealous God and One who avenges. He avenges and is full of wrath; He takes vengeance on His adversaries; and He reserves wrath for His enemies (v. 2). He is slow to anger and great in power, and He will by no means clear the guilty (v. 3). In verse 7 the prophet declares, &ldquo;Jehovah is good, / A stronghold in a day of distress; / And He knows those who take refuge in Him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Majesty of Jehovah as the Judge</h2>
<p>Verses 4 through 6 speak of the majesty of Jehovah as the Judge. He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; He dries up all the rivers; the mountains quake because of Him; and the earth is heaved up at His presence (vv. 4-5). Hence, the prophet asks, &ldquo;Who can stand before His indignation, / And who can maintain himself in the fierceness of His anger? / His wrath is poured out like fire, / And the rocks are broken down by Him&rdquo; (v. 6).</p><h2 class="head1">III. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENT ON NINEVEH</h2>
<p>The remainder of the book of Nahum (1:8&mdash;3:19) speaks of Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Nineveh. Here Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on this evil city is fully portrayed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Verdict<br />
concerning Nineveh&rsquo;s Destruction<br />
by the Medes and Babylonians</h2>
<p>First, the Judge pronounces His verdict concerning Nineveh&rsquo;s destruction by the Medes and Babylonians in 612 B.C. (1:8-12a, 14). Verse 8 says that when the time comes, God would use an overflowing flood to make a full end of her place. Chapter two shows us this flood. Nineveh was built on the Tigris River and was completely surrounded by water. This was a protection to Nineveh. Then in 612 B.C. the Medes and the Babylonians came together to attack Nineveh, and they found a way to open the gates of the river and they flooded the city (2:6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Promise of Comfort to Judah</h2>
<p>In 1:12b-13, 15 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s promise of comfort to Judah. In verse 13 He says, &ldquo;Now I will break his yoke from off you / And will snap your bonds asunder.&rdquo; &ldquo;His yoke&rdquo; refers to the yoke which Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, had placed on Israel. First, the Assyrians came to devastate Israel. Then God used Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the Assyrians, and this became a kind of deliverance to Israel.</p>
<p>Verse 15a goes on to say, &ldquo;Behold, upon the mountains / The feet of him who bears the glad news, / Who announces peace!&rdquo; This refers to the announcement of Assyria&rsquo;s defeat by the Babylonians and was a word of comfort to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. A Vision of the Destruction of Nineveh</h2>
<p>Nahum 2:1-13 presents a vision of the destruction of Nineveh.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Swift Activity<br />
of the Babylonian Armies to Destroy Nineveh</h2>
<p>Verses 1 through 4 describe the swift activity of the Babylonian armies to destroy Nineveh. The Babylonians were used by God for this purpose. Thus, verse 3 says, &ldquo;The shield of His mighty men is red; / The valiant men are clad in scarlet; / The chariots flash with the shining of steel / In the day of His preparation, / And the spears are brandished.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Way of the King of Assyria and His Queen<br />
to Encounter the Babylonian Attack</h2>
<p>Verses 5 through 7 speak of the way of the king of Assyria and his queen to encounter the Babylonian attack.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Babylonian Armies&rsquo; Plunder of the Wealth<br />
and Their Slaughter of the People of Nineveh</h2>
<p>Verses 8 through 13 record the Babylonian armies&rsquo; plunder of the wealth of the people of Nineveh and their slaughter of the people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Restoration of the Excellency of Israel</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For Jehovah restores / The excellency of Jacob / As the excellency of Israel&rdquo; (v. 2a). This indicates that the destruction of Nineveh is for the restoration of the excellency of Israel. God used the Babylonians with the Medes to invade Assyria and thereby to save Israel from the tyranny of the Assyrians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Devastation of the People of Nineveh</h2>
<p>At the very beginning of chapter three, Nahum, speaking about Nineveh, says, &ldquo;Woe to the bloody city! / She is all full of lies and pillage; / The prey does not depart&rdquo; (v. 1). The chapter goes on to describe in detail the devastation of the people of Nineveh (vv. 2-17). Significantly, verse 17 mentions locusts. &ldquo;Your princes are like the locust swarm, / And your officials are like hordes of locusts, / Which camp in the hedges / On a cold day, / But when the sun arises, they flee away, / And the place where they are is unknown.&rdquo; This indicates that the Assyrians also were locusts devastating Israel. These Assyrian locusts were eventually defeated by the Babylonian locusts.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Miserable End of the King of Assyria</h2>
<p>Nahum concludes his prophecy with a word concerning the miserable end of the king of Assyria (vv. 18-19).</p>
<p>The main point of the book of Nahum is that while God was chastising Israel and punishing the nations, He always did what was necessary to preserve Israel for the purpose of manifesting Christ. God&rsquo;s wonderful preserving act was carried out by the locusts. God used one kind of locust to deal with another kind of locust in order to preserve Israel. God&rsquo;s purpose in preserving Israel is to bring forth Christ.</p>
<p>Although this book does not say anything about Christ directly and does not refer to Christ, the goal is still the manifestation of Christ. The preserving of Israel is for the purpose that Christ might have a channel&mdash;the reserved and preserved Israel&mdash;through which to be brought forth. Regarding this, all the minor prophets are one, and the book of Nahum is just one small link on the chain of their revelation. Thus, once again we see that, according to the minor prophets, God&rsquo;s chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations are for the manifestation of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HABAKKUK</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INTRODUCTORY WORD<br />
AND<br />
THE FIRST AND THE SECOND DIALOGUES<br />
BETWEEN THE PROPHET AND JEHOVAH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hab. 1:1&mdash;2:4</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the book of Habakkuk. We will cover the introductory word, the first dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah, and the first part of the second dialogue between these parties. As we will see, the one golden verse in Habakkuk is 2:4: &ldquo;The righteous one will live by his faith.&rdquo; This verse is related to God&rsquo;s eternal salvation, to His salvation of our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body. Everything else in Habakkuk is a background for the release of the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s eternal salvation of sinners. We may compare the book of Habakkuk to a walnut and then say that this verse is the &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; of the &ldquo;walnut.&rdquo; Thus, as we read Habakkuk, we should focus our attention on this one verse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>The introductory word is found in 1:1.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Habakkuk</h2>
<p>The name Habakkuk in Hebrew means &ldquo;embracing&rdquo; or &ldquo;clinging to,&rdquo; signifying that we need to seek God by embracing Him or clinging to Him. For us to receive God&rsquo;s eternal salvation, we need to be embraced by God, and we need to cling to Him.</p>
<p>Eternal salvation is actually God Himself. God does not save us by remaining in the heavens and stretching out His arm to reach the earth. In order to save us, God became a man on this earth and came to us. The central thought of the four Gospels is that the saving God came out of eternity into time, out of the heavens to earth, and out of divinity into humanity to be a man. In this way He could embrace man and man could cling to Him.</p>
<p>While God was saving us, He was not in the appearance, the form, of God. Rather, He was in the form of a man named Jesus. Hosea 11:4 tells us that God draws us with the cords of a man, with the bands of love. The saving cords of love are Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The account of Zaccheus in Luke 19:1-10 shows us the way God saves us by coming to us. In order to be saved by God, we must be embraced by God and we must cling to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Habakkuk&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Habakkuk&rsquo;s ministry was about 626 B.C. This was close to the time of the Babylonian invasion and the exile to Babylon.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Habakkuk&rsquo;s ministry is the righteous judgment of God first on Israel by the Chaldeans and then on the Chaldeans by the nations. First, God judged His elect; God&rsquo;s judgment begins from His house (1 Pet. 4:17). Then God turned His judgment to the Chaldeans, using the nations to judge them. The Babylonian Empire was defeated by the Medo-Persian Empire; the Medo-Persian Empire was defeated by the Greek Empire; the Greek Empire was defeated by the Roman Empire; and the Roman Empire, restored under Antichrist, will be defeated by Christ in His coming to destroy the entire human government, as described in Daniel 2:31-44.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Habakkuk is this: the righteous God will judge both the evil Israel and the violent Chaldeans, and only the righteous one shall live by his faith (2:4b), that all the earth may know the glory of Jehovah (2:14) and be silent before Jehovah, who is in His holy temple (2:20), and that His seeker may sing to Him in prayer, in lauding, and in trusting in Him (ch. 3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Habakkuk has four sections: the introductory word (1:1); the first dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah (1:2-11); the second dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah (1:12&mdash;2:20); and the prophet&rsquo;s song to Jehovah in prayer, lauding, and trusting in Him (3:1-19).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE FIRST DIALOGUE<br />
BETWEEN THE PROPHET AND JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>The revelation in Habakkuk concerning God&rsquo;s eternal salvation to sinners was brought out by a conversation between the prophet and God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Prophet&rsquo;s Inquiry of Jehovah</h2>
<p>In the first dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah, the prophet inquired of Jehovah concerning the iniquity, distress, destruction, and contention that he saw (v. 2-4). Regarding violence, he said, &ldquo;How long, O Jehovah, shall I cry / And You do not hear? / I cry out to You, Violence! / And You do not save&rdquo; (v. 2). According to the prophet&rsquo;s view, violence was prevailing. Then the prophet went on to ask, &ldquo;Why do You cause me to see iniquity / And look upon distress?&rdquo; (v. 3a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah&rsquo;s Answer to the Prophet</h2>
<p>In His answer to the prophet (vv. 5-11), Jehovah said that He was doing a work in the prophet&rsquo;s days which he would not believe if it were told to him (v. 5; cf. Acts 13:40-41). Then Jehovah said that He was raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, who, being terrible and dreadful, would come to do violence and devastation on Judah (vv. 6-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE SECOND DIALOGUE<br />
BETWEEN THE PROPHET AND JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>In verse 12 we have the beginning of the second dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Prophet&rsquo;s Inquiry of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Habakkuk 1:12&mdash;2:1 is the prophet&rsquo;s inquiry of Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Asking Why Jehovah Keeps Silent<br />
When the Chaldeans Swallow Up His Elect</h2>
<p>In verse 12a the prophet said, &ldquo;Are You not from everlasting, O Jehovah, / My God, my Holy One? We will not die.&rdquo; Then he said that Jehovah, the Rock, has appointed the Chaldeans to judgment. However, he went on to ask why He, who does not behold evil and who cannot look upon distress, looks upon them who deal treacherously and keeps silent when the wicked Chaldeans swallow up His elect, who are more righteous than they (vv. 12b-13). According to Habakkuk, the people of Israel were more righteous than the Babylonians, yet they were suffering the violence of the Babylonians. Habakkuk&rsquo;s word here indicates that he was angry with God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Saying That Jehovah<br />
Makes Man like the Fish of the Sea</h2>
<p>In verses 14 through 16 the prophet said that Jehovah makes man like the fish of the sea and like the creeping things; that they take all of them up with a hook, drag them off in their net, and gather them into their seine; and that they offer sacrifices to their net and burn incense to their seine. He then concluded his inquiry by asking, &ldquo;Will they then empty their net / And continually slay the nations without sparing?&rdquo; (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Standing and Watching<br />
to See What Jehovah Would Speak to Him</h2>
<p>After making his inquiry of Jehovah, the prophet stood and watched to see what Jehovah would speak to him and what He would reply concerning his complaint (2:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah&rsquo;s Answer to the Prophet</h2>
<p>In 2:2-20 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s answer to the prophet.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Telling Him to Write the Vision</h2>
<p>In His answer to the prophet, Jehovah told him to write the vision (concerning God&rsquo;s judgment on the Chaldeans) and render it plainly upon tablets, so that he who reads it might run (v. 2).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Vision Being Yet for an Appointed Time</h2>
<p>Jehovah went on to say that the vision (concerning His dealing with the Chaldeans) was yet for an appointed time and that it hastened toward the end and would not lie. Though it tarried, the prophet should wait for it; for it will surely come; it will not delay (v. 3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Chaldeans Being Puffed Up,<br />
Their Soul Not Being Upright within Them,<br />
but the Righteous One Living by His Faith</h2>
<p>In verse 4a Jehovah said that the Chaldeans were puffed up and that their soul was not upright within them. Surely it would be fair and just for Jehovah to judge them.</p>
<p>Of the books of the Minor Prophets, only Habakkuk shows us God&rsquo;s eternal salvation to sinners. This matter is revealed in 2:4b: &ldquo;But the righteous one will live by his faith.&rdquo; The apostle Paul quoted this word three times in the New Testament (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38). Here, to live means to have life and live.</p>
<p>According to the background of Habakkuk, both Israel (God&rsquo;s elect) and Chaldeans (the nations) were under God&rsquo;s judgment. Under God&rsquo;s judgment all sinners, whether Jews or Gentiles, are destined to die (Rom. 6:23). How can sinners escape God&rsquo;s judgment and be saved eternally? The unique way for sinners to obtain God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is to believe in God&rsquo;s embodiment, Christ, that they may become righteous and be justified to have life and live.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is not merely to save our body from suffering but to save our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;for eternity (1 Thes. 5:23). The way for us to receive such a salvation is to believe in Christ so that we may be justified by God and thus be qualified to have life, the eternal life, the divine life, and live by that life (Rom. 3:24; 5:1-2; Eph. 2:8). This is the New Testament gospel in an Old Testament prophetic book.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HABAKKUK</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST AS THE LINKING FACTOR<br />
IN MICAH, JONAH, AND HABAKKUK<br />
AND<br />
THE BIBLE AS THE DIVINE REVELATION<br />
GIVEN BY GOD&rsquo;S SPEAKING THROUGH MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Micah 5:2; Jonah 1:17; Hab. 2:4</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we covered the introductory word, the first dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah, and the first part of the second dialogue between them, and in the next message we will cover the second part of this dialogue and the prophet&rsquo;s song to Jehovah. In this message, which is an insertion, I have the burden to say a word concerning two matters: Christ as the linking factor in the books of Micah, Jonah, and Habakkuk, and the Bible as the divine revelation given by God&rsquo;s speaking through man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE LINKING FACTOR<br />
IN MICAH, JONAH, AND HABAKKUK</h2>
<p>Apparently, the books of Micah, Jonah, and Habakkuk are separate and are not linked together by anything. However, if we get into the intrinsic contents of these three books, we will see that there is a linking factor and that this linking factor is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ&rsquo;s Origin and Birth</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ is the eternal One; His origin is in eternity. But one day He was born as a man in Bethlehem. Thus, here we have Christ&rsquo;s origin and birth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ&rsquo;s Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>Jonah 1:17 says, &ldquo;Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah up, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights.&rdquo; Here Jonah is a type of Christ, who died, who was in the heart of the earth three days and three nights, and who then was resurrected (Matt. 12:40-41). Thus, in the type of Jonah, we see Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteous One Living by His Faith</h2>
<p>In the book of Jonah, Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation was brought to the most evil city of the Gentiles through the preaching of the prophet. Today God&rsquo;s salvation has come to us through the preaching of the gospel. We have received and applied God&rsquo;s salvation by faith. This is what is mentioned in the one golden verse in the book of Habakkuk, 2:4: &ldquo;The righteous one will live by his faith.&rdquo; By faith we have received the salvation that was prepared, completed, and consummated by Christ&rsquo;s coming forth, and as a result we now are believers constituting the Body of Christ. Eventually, those believers who are the overcomers will be with Christ when He comes to defeat His enemies and to set up His kingdom on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need to See Something Intrinsic</h2>
<p>From the foregoing we can see that Christ Himself is the linking factor in the Minor Prophets. We have seen His origin, birth, death, and resurrection. We have also seen that through His going forth after His resurrection, God&rsquo;s complete salvation has come to us and that we have received it by faith.</p>
<p>Whereas we can see Christ as the linking factor, the worldly people see only the consuming factor (the locusts) and the suffering factor (Israel). For twenty-seven centuries Israel has been suffering under the locusts with their cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming (Joel 1:4). The newspapers are full of reports concerning the locusts and Israel. We need to see something more than what is reported in the newspapers. We need to see something intrinsic. This means that we need to see that Christ, the eternal One, has gone forth in His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and that His going forth is continuing today as more believers are added to Him. We may compare His going forth to the movement of a train that makes various stops so that more goods can be loaded onto it. Christ is the &ldquo;train&rdquo; and we are the &ldquo;goods&rdquo; that are in Him. Eventually, this train with its goods will reach its destination.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE AS THE DIVINE REVELATION<br />
GIVEN BY GOD&rsquo;S SPEAKING THROUGH MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible is the divine revelation through God&rsquo;s speaking. Regarding this, we need to realize that it is not easy for God to speak to human beings directly. In the Old Testament the incarnation had not yet been accomplished; however, God knew that He intended to become a man. His being incarnated was the first step of all His goings forth, and God was anticipating this. The principle according to the divine revelation is that God would not do anything directly but would do everything through man, with man, and in man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Transferred out of Adam and into Christ</h2>
<p>The matter of God being in man is not clearly seen in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament, especially beginning from John, there are phrases like <em>in Me</em> (14:20) and <em>abide inMe</em> (15:4). We believe <em>into</em> the Lord Jesus (3:16), and now we are in Him. Before believing we were outside of Christ; we were in Adam. But one day we were transferred out of Adam and into Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. Now we are persons in Christ. Unfortunately, not many Christians realize that genuine, living Christians are those who are actually and practically in Christ. The importance of being in Christ is stressed by Paul in his Epistles, where, especially in Ephesians, the short phrase <em>in Christ</em> is so frequently used.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Strong Accent in the Old Testament</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament it is difficult to find a case which proves that God&rsquo;s people are those who have been transferred into the Triune God. Nevertheless, in each of the prophets&rsquo; books, wherever they speak concerning Christ, that is the great point, the strong accent, of that book. For example, the strong accent of the book of Joel is not the locusts but the outpouring of the consummated Spirit. Actually, this is the accent of the entire Old Testament, for the outpouring of the Spirit is the practical realization of Christ, who is the living, compound, consummated, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit. This Christ is just the Triune God, consummated through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. But this is not all. Following His ascension is His being poured out, His coming down, to indwell man and mingle with man. This mingling implies a dispositional sanctifying, renewing, transforming, conforming, maturing, and glorifying. Eventually, this mingling makes us one with the divine person of the processed Triune God, whose embodiment is Christ and whose reality is the Spirit. Today this Spirit is the all-inclusive One indwelling us, moving in us, anointing us, and mingling with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Kernel, the Intrinsic Part,<br />
of the Old Testament</h2>
<p>Christ is revealed in the Old Testament by the types, the prophecies, the historical writings, and the Psalms. The types of Christ, the prophecies concerning Christ, and the historical writings do not need to be purified, but we must study the Psalms in a purifying way. Among the first forty-one psalms, only seven present a clear revelation of Christ (Psa. 2, 8, 16, 22&mdash;24, 40). Psalm 1 is good, but it is good according to the natural concept. Still, this psalm is necessary, for without it, how could the beauty of Psalm 2 be manifested?</p>
<p>Let us use an orange tree as an illustration. In order to grow, an orange needs not only its peel but also the whole tree with the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. However, none of these should be eaten. Actually, to eat or drink, the only thing we need is the orange juice. This illustration points to something crucial related to the enjoyment of Christ, the eating of Christ. In order to see Christ in reality, we need all one hundred fifty of the psalms, but to enjoy Christ, to feed on Christ, we need to come to the revelation of Christ in the Psalms.</p>
<p>The Bible is the divine speaking, but this divine speaking is not something that has come directly by God Himself. This speaking is by God through man. For instance, God charged David to speak what is in Psalm 2, but because David was full of opinions and concepts and because he loved the law to the uttermost, he spoke Psalm 1. He added something of his own. Today when we come to the Bible, we may not know what is the real message and what is the human addition. This may be our situation when we come to the Minor Prophets. In these books there are some human concepts. When Jonah was angry with God and argued with God, he was expressing his own human concept. The vital point here is that whereas the entire Bible is the divine revelation, it is the kernel, the intrinsic part, that is good for eating and drinking to nourish us.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HABAKKUK</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SECOND DIALOGUE<br />
BETWEEN THE PROPHET AND JEHOVAH<br />
AND<br />
THE PROPHET&rsquo;S SONG TO JEHOVAH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hab. 2:5&mdash;3:20</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the second dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah and then go on to consider the prophet&rsquo;s song to Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Five Woes to the Chaldeans</h2>
<p>After the prophet&rsquo;s inquiry of Jehovah (1:12&mdash;2:1), Jehovah answered Habakkuk (2:2-20), revealing His judgment upon the Chaldeans (vv. 5-20). In His answer to the prophet, Jehovah spoke concerning the five woes to the Chaldeans.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The First Woe</h2>
<p>First, because the Chaldeans had plundered many nations, the Chaldeans would be plundered and made booty to the nations (vv. 5-8). After just over seventy years, God recompensed Babylon. While the king, Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s grandson, was feasting in his palace using the utensils from God&rsquo;s temple, he saw the vision of the writing on the wall (Dan. 5). In that same night, Darius the Mede defeated Babylon and killed the king.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Second Woe</h2>
<p>Second, Jehovah judged the Chaldeans because of their taking evil gain for their houses by violence, sinning against their own soul (vv. 9-10). As a result of this judgment, the stone would cry out from the wall of their houses and the rafter would answer from the timber of the houses (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Third Woe</h2>
<p>Third, the Chaldeans would receive the righteous recompense for building cities by bloodshed and establishing towns by iniquity (v. 12). It was of Jehovah that the peoples toiled for vanity and that the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the water covers the sea (vv. 13-14). This is mysterious. While all these things are taking place, something particular, something mysterious would be happening on earth&mdash;the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Fourth Woe</h2>
<p>Fourth, because the Chaldeans made their neighbor drunken with poison in order to look at their nakedness and did violence, destruction, and bloodshed to their cities, they would be sated with shame, with the cup of Jehovah&rsquo;s right hand and with disgrace upon their glory (vv. 15-17).</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Fifth Woe</h2>
<p>Fifth, the Chaldeans made the graven idol, the molten idol, and the dumb idols and said to them, &ldquo;Awake!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Arise!&rdquo; Therefore, they would be cheated by the idols and gain no profit (vv. 18-19). Verse 20 concludes, &ldquo;Jehovah is in His holy temple: / Be silent before Him, all the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PROPHET&rsquo;S SONG TO JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>Habakkuk 3:1-19 is the prophet&rsquo;s song to Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Prayer</h2>
<p>First, we have the prophet&rsquo;s song in prayer (vv. 1-2). In his prayer he asked Jehovah to revive His work in those years (vv. 1-2a), and he asked Him to make it known in those years that He will remember compassion in wrath.</p><h2 class="head2">B. In Lauding</h2>
<p>In lauding, the prophet praised God in His majesty and splendor (vv. 3-4), in His terrifying judgment on the nations (vv. 5-12), and in His salvation of His people and of His anointed one (vv. 13-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In Trusting in Jehovah</h2>
<p>In verses 16 through 19 the prophet declares his trust in Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Prophet Trembling in His Place</h2>
<p>Verse 16a says that the prophet, after hearing the voice of Jehovah, trembled in his place, with his lips quivering at the sound and rottenness entering his bones. Habakkuk&rsquo;s writing here is quite poetic.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Prophet Waiting for the Day of Distress</h2>
<p>In verse 16b the prophet went on to say that he had to wait quietly for the day of distress, when the Chaldeans, the ones attacking (or invading) Israel, would come up against the people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Prophet Exulting in Jehovah<br />
and Rejoicing in the God of His Salvation,<br />
and Jehovah the Lord Being His Strength</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For the fig tree will not sprout, / And there will be no yield on the vines; / The labor on the olive tree will fail, / And the fields will make no food; / The flock will be cut off from the fold, / And there will be no herd in the stalls. / Yet I will exult in Jehovah; / I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. / Jehovah the Lord is my strength; / And He makes my feet like hinds&rsquo; feet / And will cause me to walk on my high places&rdquo; (vv. 17-19a). These verses indicate that in a dark time, a time when there was nothing, Habakkuk trusted in Jehovah.</p>
<p>All these verses seem very good, but for the most part they express Habakkuk&rsquo;s natural concept, without much revelation of Christ. Even Habakkuk&rsquo;s concept of trusting in Jehovah during a time of need was natural. There is no comparison between these verses and Paul&rsquo;s writings. Paul&rsquo;s concept was different. When he was troubled, he prayed three times, but the Lord told him that He would not remove the thorn and that His grace was sufficient for him (2 Cor. 12:7-10). When Paul was short of food, he did not &ldquo;trust&rdquo; in the Lord in the way Habakkuk did; rather, he took the opportunity to fast. In a very real sense, he did not need to trust in the Lord, for he was in the Lord already, and the Lord was in him. Furthermore, instead of trying to keep the law, he lived Christ (Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:21a).</p>
<p>Whereas many Christians appreciate verses such as Habakkuk 3:17-19a, we need to be brought into another realm, the realm of Christ. These verses are not according to the divine revelation concerning Christ but according to the prophet&rsquo;s natural, human, and religious concept. If we are brought into the realm of Christ, we will not appreciate the natural, religious thought expressed in much of the Old Testament. Rather, we will treasure the divine revelation in the Word. Moreover, instead of &ldquo;trusting&rdquo; in the Lord like Habakkuk did, we will see that the crucial matter is not trusting but realizing that we are in Christ and that Christ is in us.</p>
<p>In our reading of the book of Habakkuk, we should not appreciate those things that fit in with our natural, religious concept but are not according to the divine revelation. This is why I emphasize the fact that the one matter we need to treasure in Habakkuk is found in 2:4b&mdash;the righteous shall have life and live by faith.</p>
<p>More than sixty years ago I read something by Brother Nee which said that it is wrong to pray and ask the Lord to help us. At that time I did not understand what he meant. However, I have learned from experience that the only prayer that gives me joy is this: &ldquo;Praise You, Lord. You are one with me. Regardless of how weak and poor I am, I am in You and You are in me.&rdquo; But suppose I pray, &ldquo;Lord, I still need Your help. I am weak and poor, and I have nothing. I ask You to come in to help me.&rdquo; If I were to pray in this way, the joy would be gone.</p>
<p>Concerning prayer, we should take Paul as our example, not Habakkuk. Paul did not pray for common things. On the contrary, he prayed that &ldquo;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him&rdquo; (Eph. 1:17). We all need to have our view uplifted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Song Being for the Choir Director</h2>
<p>The last part of verse 19 says that the song of the prophet is for the choir director, with the prophet&rsquo;s stringed instrument.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON ZEPHANIAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENT AND SALVATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zeph. 1&mdash;3</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the book of Zephaniah. The revelation in this book is very simple and concerns two matters&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment and His salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>Zephaniah 1:1 is the introductory word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Zephaniah</h2>
<p>The name Zephaniah in Hebrew means &ldquo;Jah hides&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jah treasures,&rdquo; probably signifying to be hidden by Jehovah as His treasure in the day of His anger (2:3). In the day of God&rsquo;s anger, we need to be the treasure hidden in Him.</p>
<p>In 1:1 we are told that Zephaniah was &ldquo;the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah.&rdquo; As a descendant of Hezekiah, a good king, Zephaniah was a royal descendant. One of his ancestors was another good king, Josiah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Zephaniah&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Zephaniah&rsquo;s ministry was about 630 B.C., at the time of Habakkuk and Jeremiah, not long before the beginning of the Babylonian captivity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of Zephaniah&rsquo;s ministry was Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the territory of Judah and Jerusalem, the capital of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Zephaniah&rsquo;s prophecy is Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Israel and on the nations and His salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel. Jehovah judges Israel as well as the nations, and He saves the nations as well as Israel. His judgment and His salvation are universal.</p>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Israel and on the nations and His salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel have a particular order. His judgment is first on Israel and then on the nations, but His salvation is first to the Gentiles and then to Israel. Today thousands of Gentiles have been saved, but very few among the millions of Jews have been saved. In God&rsquo;s economy, this is the age for His salvation to go to the Gentiles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Zephaniah is that Jehovah is the judging and saving God both to Israel and to the nations, issuing in His reigning among Israel (3:15b) and in Israel&rsquo;s singing and rejoicing in their restoration (3:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In this book the revelation concerning Christ is in His being the King of Israel in the midst of her in the restoration (3:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Zephaniah has three sections: the introductory word (1:1); Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment (1:2&mdash;3:8), including His judgment on Israel (1:2&mdash;2:3; 3:1-7) and on the nations (2:4-15; 3:8); and Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation (3:9-20) to the Gentiles (v. 9) and to Israel (vv. 10-20).</p><h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENT</h2>
<p>Let us now go on to consider the matter of Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. On Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Cutting Off the Wicked</h2>
<p>In His judgment on Israel, Jehovah will cut off man, beast, birds, fish, stumbling blocks, the wicked, the remnant of Baal, the idol worshippers, the idol priests with the priests, the worshippers of the host of heaven, the worshippers of Malcam, and those who have been turned back from going after Jehovah (1:2-6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Preparing Jerusalem<br />
with Its Princes</h2>
<p>In His judgment on Israel, Jehovah would also prepare Jerusalem with its princes, the sons of the king, all who wore the clothing of foreigners, and all those who did violence and deceit, as His sacrifice, and He would call the Chaldeans, whom He had sanctified, to come and eat His sacrifice by plundering the wealth of Jerusalem and desolating the houses and vineyards in Jerusalem (vv. 7-13). God had prepared His sinful elect as His sacrifice to offer to the invading army of the Chaldeans (Ezek. 39:19-20; Jer. 25:9). The Chaldean army, as the cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming locusts, would destroy Israel, and this destruction would be their eating of the sacrifice.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Great Day of Jehovah<br />
Being Near</h2>
<p>In verses 14 through 18 the prophet said that the great day of Jehovah was near. This would be a day of overflowing wrath, a day of trouble and distress, and a day of waste and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and deep darkness, and a day of trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities and the high battlements. Jehovah would bring distress upon the people so that they would walk about like the blind. Their blood would be poured out like the dust, and their bowels like dung. Neither their silver nor their gold would be able to deliver them. The whole land would be devoured by the fire of Jehovah&rsquo;s wrath and jealousy, for He would make an end, a sudden destruction, of all the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Prophet&rsquo;s Admonition<br />
to the Shameless People of Israel</h2>
<p>In 2:1-3 we have the prophet&rsquo;s admonition to the shameless people of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Admonishing Them to Gather Themselves Together<br />
to Repent to Jehovah</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gather yourselves together, yes, gather, / O nation that has no shame, / Before the decree has effect, / (The day passes like chaff) / Before there comes upon you / The burning anger of Jehovah, / Before there comes upon you / The day of Jehovah&rsquo;s anger&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Here the prophet said that before the burning anger of Jehovah came upon them, they should gather themselves together to repent to Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Admonishing Them to Seek<br />
Jehovah, Righteousness, and Meekness</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Seek Jehovah, / All you meek of the earth, / Who have performed His judgments. / Seek righteousness; / Seek meekness; / Perhaps you will be hidden / In the day of Jehovah&rsquo;s anger&rdquo; (v. 3). Here the prophet admonished them to seek Jehovah, to seek righteousness, and to seek meekness so that they would be hidden in the day of Jehovah&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Degradation of Jerusalem<br />
at the Prophet&rsquo;s Time</h2>
<p>In 3:1-7 the prophet speaks concerning the degradation of Jerusalem at his time. This degradation was the cause of God&rsquo;s coming in to judge, correct, and chastise them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. On the Nations</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on the nations would include His judgment on the Philistines (2:4-7), on Moab and Ammon (vv. 8-11), on the Cushites (v. 12), on Assyria (vv. 13-15), and on all the nations (3:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>In 3:9-20 we have a word concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To The Gentiles</h2>
<p>In His salvation to the Gentiles, Jehovah, in the time of restoration, will &ldquo;change the language of the peoples / Into a pure language&rdquo; (v. 9). To change a people&rsquo;s language is to change their culture because culture is wrapped up with language. The original language of any people is dirty and impure. But in His salvation God will change the language of the peoples into a pure language. When a person&rsquo;s language has become pure, this indicates that a person has been thoroughly saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To Israel</h2>
<p>In verses 10 through 20 the prophet speaks regarding Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation to Israel. His salvation to Israel is for Christ to be the King of Israel. In these verses first we see Jehovah&rsquo;s deliverance (vv. 10-13, 15-20) and then Israel&rsquo;s singing and rejoicing (v. 14).</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON HAGGAI</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE OF JEHOVAH<br />
IN RELATION TO ISRAEL&rsquo;S WELFARE<br />
AND MESSIAH&rsquo;S COMING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hag. 1&mdash;2</h1>
<p>In this message we will cover the book of Haggai, a book that is concerned with the building of the house of Jehovah in relation to Israel&rsquo;s welfare and Messiah&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>Haggai 1:1 is the introductory word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Haggai</h2>
<p>The name Haggai in Hebrew means &ldquo;My feast&rdquo; or &ldquo;the feast of Jehovah,&rdquo; signifying that Haggai the prophet, who had been born in captivity in Babylon, expected earnestly to return from the captivity that the feasts of Jehovah might be restored.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Haggai&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Haggai&rsquo;s ministry was 520 B.C., at the time of Zechariah (Ezra 5:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the returned Israelites.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the prophecy of Haggai is Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the returned captives for the building of His house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of the book of Haggai is that the building of the house of Jehovah is related to the welfare of God&rsquo;s people today and to the coming of the millennial kingdom with its Messiah in the age of restoration. In the Old Testament the house of God, or the temple, was a type first of Christ as the house of God individually, and then of the church, the Body, the enlarged Christ, as God&rsquo;s house corporately. Thus, we should consider that Haggai refers to us, since we are the reality of the type. Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the returned captives signifies His dealing with us in the recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>The revelation concerning Christ in the book of Haggai covers two matters.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ&rsquo;s Being the Desire of All the Nations</h2>
<p>First, this book reveals Christ in His being the Desire of all the nations (2:7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ&rsquo;s Coming as the Messiah<br />
in the Coming Age</h2>
<p>Second, this book reveals Christ in His coming as the Messiah (typified by Zerubbabel the governor) in the coming age (2:23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>Haggai has three sections: the introductory word (1:1); Jehovah&rsquo;s rebuke and charge concerning the delay of the building of His house (1:2-15); and the prophecy concerning the house of Jehovah in the millennium and the promise of Messiah in the coming kingdom (2:1-23).</p><h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S REBUKE AND CHARGE<br />
CONCERNING THE DELAY OF<br />
THE BUILDING OF HIS HOUSE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah&rsquo;s Rebuke</h2>
<p>In 1:2-6, 9-11 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s rebuke.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The People&rsquo;s Excuse</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Thus says Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people says, The time has not come, the time for the house of Jehovah to be built&rdquo; (v. 2). Here we have the people&rsquo;s excuse for delaying to rebuild the house of Jehovah. Their excuse was the time had not yet come for the house of Jehovah to be built.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Question</h2>
<p>The people&rsquo;s excuse is followed by Jehovah&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Then the word of Jehovah came through Haggai the prophet, saying, Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled up houses, while this house lies waste?&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). They were taking care of their houses but not Jehovah&rsquo;s house, so He came in to ask them concerning His house.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah&rsquo;s Dealing with the Self-caring<br />
and God-neglecting Returned Captives</h2>
<p>In verses 5, 6, and 9 through 11 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the self-caring and God-neglecting returned captives.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Charging Them to Consider Their Ways</h2>
<p>In His dealing, the first thing Jehovah did was to charge the people to consider their ways (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Telling Them That They Had Sown Much<br />
but Had Brought in Little</h2>
<p>Jehovah pointed out that the returned captives had sown much but had brought in little; that they had eaten and drunk but without satisfaction; that they had clothed themselves but without being warmed; and that they had earned wages to put them into a bag with holes (v. 6). This tells us that if we do not have the heart to take care of God&rsquo;s house for His satisfaction, no matter how much we eat or drink or how well we dress ourselves, there will be no satisfaction. If we neglect the church, we will have no real enjoyment or satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Saying That They Looked for Much<br />
and It Amounted to Little</h2>
<p>In verse 9 Jehovah went on to say that they looked for much, and it amounted to little. When they brought it home, He blew on it because of His house which lay waste, and they each ran to their own house. Therefore, over them the heavens withheld their dew, and the earth withheld its yield (v. 10). Indeed, Jehovah had called for a drought upon the land, upon the mountains, upon the grain, upon the new wine, upon the fresh oil, upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon man, beast, and all the toil of the hands (v. 11).</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;run&rdquo; in verse 9 indicates that the people were busy caring for their own houses. Today some saints are so busy caring for their own houses that they have no time to attend the meetings. As we consider this, we need to realize that in the entire universe there is no such thing as neutrality. We must be absolute. We must either take care of our houses first or take care of the Lord&rsquo;s house first. My point here is that we need to learn to save some time for the Lord&rsquo;s interests. How many sinners are waiting for our visitation? How many saints, especially younger ones, are waiting for our cherishing and nourishing? We may excuse ourselves today, but we need to consider how we will answer the Lord Jesus when He comes. We may have many relatives who are unsaved. Their being unsaved may be our fault, not theirs. If so, when the Lord comes to settle accounts with us (Matt. 25:19), He will surely rebuke us. It has been difficult for us to get the increase, not mainly because of our environment but because of our excuses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
<p>In His charge Jehovah told the people to consider their ways and to go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house, and He would take pleasure in it and would be glorified (Hag. 1:7-8). Today our gospel preaching is our gathering of material for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The People&rsquo;s Response</h2>
<p>Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest and all the remnant of the people responded to Jehovah by listening to the voice of Jehovah their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet, and they were in fear before Jehovah (v. 12). Then Haggai, Jehovah&rsquo;s messenger, encouraged the people with Jehovah&rsquo;s declaration, &ldquo;I am with you&rdquo; (v. 13). Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the spirit of Joshua, and the spirit of all the people, and they came and did work in the house of Jehovah of hosts (vv. 14-15). What a wonderful response!</p>
<p>I hope that all the dear saints will be busy in going out to visit people and in contacting their relatives, classmates, and colleagues for the gospel. All the saints should be occupied by the Lord Jesus in preaching the gospel, feeding the new believers, and taking care of others. I hope that concerning this the whole atmosphere and environment among us will be revolutionized.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE PROPHECY CONCERNING THE HOUSE<br />
OF JEHOVAH IN THE MILLENNIUM<br />
AND THE PROMISE OF MESSIAH<br />
IN THE COMING KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Haggai 2:1-23 is the prophecy concerning the house of Jehovah in the millennium and the promise of Messiah in the coming kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Prophecy concerning the House<br />
of Jehovah in the Millennium,<br />
as an Encouragement to the Building<br />
of Jehovah&rsquo;s House at Zerubbabel&rsquo;s Time</h2>
<p>In verses 1 through 9 the prophet Haggai was charged to speak to the people concerning the house of Jehovah. &ldquo;For thus says Jehovah of hosts, Yet once more&mdash;it is but a little while&mdash;I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all the nations, and the Desire of all the nations will come; and I will fill this house with glory, says Jehovah of hosts. The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, declares Jehovah of hosts. The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former, says Jehovah of hosts; and in this place I will give peace, declares Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (vv. 6-9). This prophecy concerning the house of Jehovah in the millennium was an encouragement to the building of Jehovah&rsquo;s house at Zerubbabel&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Verse 7 reveals that Christ is the Desire of all the nations. I appreciate the line in Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymn that says, &ldquo;Come, Desire of nations, come!&rdquo; Christ truly is the desire of all mankind. All people desire to have life, light, peace, goodness, and righteousness, yet they do not realize that what they desire is really Christ. Christ is life, light, and peace. If we do not have Him, we do not have life, light, peace, or any of the human virtues. Christ is the reality of every human virtue. Thus, to desire virtue actually is to desire Christ.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s arrangement in His creation of man, the human virtues, such as love, kindness, patience, and humility, are for the expression of the divine attributes. It is God&rsquo;s intention that the attributes of His being would be expressed by man in his virtues. As an illustration of this, consider a glove that is designed in the form of a human hand. The hand is the content of the glove, and the glove is the expression of the hand. Likewise, the human virtues are the &ldquo;glove&rdquo; for the expression of the divine attributes as the &ldquo;hand.&rdquo; Just as a glove without a hand has no content, so the human virtues without the divine attributes have no reality.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:26 tells us that God made man in His own image and according to His likeness. Nevertheless, man was empty, having only the outward form but not having God as his inward content. God intended, therefore, that the man created in His image would exercise his will to choose God, signified by the tree of life, as his content. To choose God in this way means that we receive God&rsquo;s life with His attributes into us to be expressed through us by our virtues. For example, one of God&rsquo;s attributes is love. We may say that this love is part of the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; and that our human virtue of love is part of the &ldquo;glove.&rdquo; Even unbelievers have a natural, human love. Of course, they do not have the divine attribute of love. As believers, we have received God as our life, and as He lives within us, His attribute of love is expressed through the virtue of our human love. In this way, Christ becomes the reality of this human virtue.</p>
<p>Today people everywhere desire life, light, love, patience, and endurance without realizing that to desire these virtues is actually to desire Christ. All people, including unbelievers, desire Christ unconsciously. This is what it means to say that Christ is the Desire of all the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The People&rsquo;s Uncleanness<br />
and Jehovah&rsquo;s Dealing with Them<br />
and Then Blessing Them</h2>
<p>In verses 10 through 19 the prophet spoke about the people&rsquo;s uncleanness and Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with them and then blessing them. The uncleanness here was not physical but moral and spiritual, involving their relationship with God. Once the uncleanness was removed, they would be blessed by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Promise of Messiah<br />
in the Coming Kingdom</h2>
<p>Finally, in verses 20 through 23 we have the promise of Messiah (typified by Zerubbabel) in the coming kingdom. Haggai was charged to speak to Zerubbabel, saying, &ldquo;I will shake the heavens and the earth. And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms and will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, each by the sword of his brother. In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant, declares Jehovah, and make you as a signet ring; for I have chosen you, declares Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (vv. 21-23). Jehovah&rsquo;s making Zerubbabel as a signet ring indicates that Jehovah regarded him as His representative and that He loved him and trusted him. Zerubbabel was surely such a one. He represented God, and he was loved and trusted by God.</p>
<p>In this matter Zerubbabel is a type of Christ, for God&rsquo;s signet has been given to Christ. He represents God, and He is the One whom God loves and trusts. As such a person, He is qualified to take care of the building of God&rsquo;s house, the church.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON MALACHI</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INTRODUCTORY WORD<br />
AND<br />
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S LOVE OF JACOB<br />
AND HIS DEALING WITH THE SONS OF LEVI</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mal. 1:1&mdash;3:4</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the prophecy of Malachi. The book of Malachi is the concluding word of the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>Malachi 1:1 is the introductory word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Malachi</h2>
<p>The name Malachi in Hebrew means &ldquo;My messenger,&rdquo; signifying that Malachi was a messenger of God to minister the word of Jehovah to His people Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Malachi&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Malachi&rsquo;s ministry was about 400 B.C., at Nehemiah&rsquo;s time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the returned Israelites.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of his ministry is Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Levi (the priests among Israel) and with the sons of Jacob (the people of Israel).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of the prophecy of Malachi is the correcting of the priests among Israel for the coming of Christ as the Messenger of God and the advising of the people of Israel for the appearing of Christ as the Sun of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In Malachi Christ is revealed in His first coming as the Messenger of God (3:1-3) and in His second coming as the Angel of the covenant (3:1) and as the Sun of righteousness (4:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Malachi has four sections: the introductory word (1:1); Jehovah&rsquo;s love for Jacob (1:2-5); Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Levi (1:6&mdash;3:4); and Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Jacob (3:5&mdash;4:6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S LOVE FOR JACOB</h2>
<p>Malachi 1:2-5 speaks of Jehovah&rsquo;s love for Jacob.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah Loving Jacob but Hating Esau</h2>
<p>In verses 2b and 3a Jehovah utters a very frank word related to Jacob and Esau. He says, &ldquo;I loved Jacob; but Esau I hated.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Edom Being Called<br />
the Territory of Wickedness</h2>
<p>Jehovah goes on to say that Edom (the country of Esau) would be called the territory of wickedness and the people with whom Jehovah is indignant forever (vv. 3b-4). Both the place and the people were displeasing to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah Being Magnified<br />
over the Territory of Israel (in Edom)</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Your eyes will see it, and you yourselves will say, Jehovah is magnified over the territory of Israel.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;over the territory of Israel&rdquo; means outside this territory. Even though the nation of Edom has been condemned and the people of Edom are the object of God&rsquo;s indignation, yet even in Edom, outside Israel, Jehovah will be magnified.</p><h2 class="head1">III. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALING WITH THE SONS OF LEVI<br />
(THE PRIESTS)</h2>
<p>In 1:6&mdash;3:4 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Levi, that is, His dealing with the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Degradation of the Priests</h2>
<p>Malachi 1:6-14 is a word regarding the degradation of the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Despising Jehovah&rsquo;s Name and His Table</h2>
<p>The degradation of the priests was seen first in their despising Jehovah&rsquo;s name and His table (vv. 6-7, 12-13a). They cared neither for Jehovah&rsquo;s name nor for the enjoyment of His table.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Presenting to Jehovah<br />
Blemished Offerings</h2>
<p>The priests presented to Jehovah blemished offerings, offerings that were blind, lame, or sick (v. 8). They brought what was stolen, lame, and sick and offered it as a sacrifice (v. 13b). Thus, Jehovah said, &ldquo;Cursed be the deceiver who has in his flock a male, and when he makes a vow, he offers what is blemished to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 14a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah&rsquo;s Abhorring of Their Offerings</h2>
<p>Jehovah did not have any joy in receiving their blemished offerings. On the contrary, He abhorred them (vv. 9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Greatness of Jehovah&rsquo;s Name<br />
among the Nations</h2>
<p>In verses 11 and 14b we have a word concerning the greatness of Jehovah&rsquo;s name among the nations. In verse 11 He said that His name would be great among the nations, and in verse 14b He declared that His name was feared among the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Priests&rsquo; Breaking of<br />
Jehovah&rsquo;s Commandment and<br />
Their Corrupting of Jehovah&rsquo;s Covenant</h2>
<p>The priests broke Jehovah&rsquo;s commandment and they corrupted Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant. This brought Jehovah&rsquo;s curse to them (2:1-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Treachery of Judah among the Brothers<br />
and Their Profaneness toward Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 10 through 12 speak of the treachery of Judah (actually the priests, who lived in Judah and served in Jerusalem) among the brothers and their profaneness toward Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah&rsquo;s Hatred of the Treachery<br />
of Man toward His Wife</h2>
<p>In verses 13 through 17 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s hatred of the treachery of man (mainly referring to the priests) toward his wife.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Treachery of a Priest<br />
toward His Wife Damaging His Priesthood</h2>
<p>Verses 13 and 14 indicate that the treachery of a priest toward his wife damages his priesthood. Probably some of the mistreated wives came and wept at the altar (vv. 13a, 14). Because of this, Jehovah no longer regarded the sacrifices or received them with pleasure from the priests&rsquo; hands (v. 13b). Here we see a very important matter. If a servant of the Lord cannot have a proper life with his wife, his service will be annulled.</p>
<p>Every young person must consider his or her marriage very carefully. All the brothers and sisters are priests. If we cannot live well with our spouse, how can we serve the church? If our married life is improper, our priesthood will be finished; it will be brought to nothing.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Making the Priest and His Wife One<br />
in Order to Produce the Seed of God</h2>
<p>In verse 15 Malachi goes on to say that in marriage God has made the husband and wife one in order to produce &ldquo;the seed of God,&rdquo; that is, godly children.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah Hating Divorce</h2>
<p>Jehovah hates divorce; and the one who divorces his wife behaves in violence (v. 16). In the sight of God, divorce is a violent act.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Jehovah Being Wearied<br />
with the Priests&rsquo; Words</h2>
<p>According to verse 17, the priests wearied Jehovah with their words. They wearied Him by saying, &ldquo;Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and He delights in them; or, Where is the God of justice?&rdquo; Such words were wrongful accusations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. To Refine and Purify the Priests<br />
by His Coming as the Messenger of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Levi is to refine and purify the priests by His coming as the Messenger of Jehovah (3:1-4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. This Prophecy Having a Threefold Fulfillment</h2>
<p>This prophecy has a threefold fulfillment.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. In the Coming of the Prophet Malachi</h2>
<p>First, this prophecy was fulfilled in the coming of the prophet Malachi, the type of Christ as the coming One.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In the First Coming of Christ<br />
with John the Baptist as His Forerunner</h2>
<p>Second, this prophecy was fulfilled in the first coming of Christ with John the Baptist as His forerunner (Matt. 11:7-13). In His first coming, Christ came as a Messenger and even as the message sent by God to adjust, refine, and purify the priests. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus frequently rebuked the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In the Second Coming of Christ<br />
with Elijah as His Forerunner</h2>
<p>Third, this prophecy will be fulfilled in the second coming of Christ with Elijah as His forerunner (Isa. 40:3-5, 9-11; Matt. 17:11; Rev. 11:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ Suddenly Coming<br />
as the Angel of the Covenant</h2>
<p>Christ will come suddenly as the Angel of the covenant, whom the people of Israel seek and whom the people of Israel desire (Mal. 3:1; Hag. 2:7a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. To Execute upon Israel the Covenant<br />
That He Enacted through His Death</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s coming suddenly as the Angel of the covenant will be to execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death (Matt. 26:28). He came in the sense of an Angel to serve God in forming the new testament. When He established His table on the night in which He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus told us that He was enacting the new covenant: &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant established in My blood&rdquo; (Luke 22:20). Thus He formed the new testament, in which God is obligated to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, our life law, and our everything as our content. Although the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant nearly two thousand years ago, generally speaking the Jewish people have not benefitted by it. Instead, the benefit has gone to the Gentiles. However, when Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews. At that time they will become beneficiaries of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. To Refine and Purify the Sons of Levi</h2>
<p>Christ will come also to refine and purify the sons of Levi, mainly the priests, like a refiner&rsquo;s fire and like fuller&rsquo;s soap that they may offer to God the proper sacrifice (Mal. 3:2-4). In the millennium the repentant Jews who are regenerated through the new covenant will be the priests to take care of all the nations. For this they will need much refining and purifying. Therefore, in His second coming Christ will renew, sanctify, and transform Israel to be His refined and purified priests.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON MALACHI</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN HIS TWO COMINGS<br />
AS REVEALED IN MALACHI</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mal. 3:1-3; 4:1-3</h1>
<p>The book of Malachi is on Christ directly. In this message I have the burden to give a further word on the revelation of Christ in Malachi.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST COMING AS THE MESSENGER OF GOD</h2>
<p>The book of Malachi reveals Christ in His first coming and in His second coming. In His first coming He is the Messenger of God. As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God&rsquo;s people; He Himself is the living message. This is fully proved by the four Gospels, which are a complete and perfect record of Christ as the living message sent by God to His chosen people. While the Lord Jesus was living on earth, as He traveled through the cities and as He spoke to the people, ministering Himself into the intrinsic part of their being, He Himself was the message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST COMING AS THE ANGEL OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Enacting the New Covenant</h2>
<p>In His second coming, Christ will be the Angel of the covenant, the Desire of nations (3:1), and the Sun of righteousness (4:2). Actually, Christ was the Angel of the covenant even in His first coming. As the Angel of the covenant, Christ enacted the new covenant. Before going to the cross, the last thing He did was to establish the new covenant at His table (Matt. 26:26-30).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers, as Sons of God,<br />
Being One with God in His Life and Nature</h2>
<p>Based upon this new covenant (Heb. 8:10-12), we are forgiven by God, who even forgets our failures. God is then able to dispense Himself into our intrinsic being to be our life, to be the law of life, and to be everything to us as our inward content that we may live Him. This means that the new covenant is to make us absolutely one with God. He becomes us, and we, being constituted with Him, are one with Him in His life and nature. The New Testament reveals that He and we form a mutual abode (John 14:20, 23). What a miracle this is!</p>
<p>We need to have the proper understanding of what it means to say that God has been constituted into us to become us and that we have become one with God in His life and nature. The New Testament reveals that God is our Father and that we are His sons. We are not sons who have been adopted by God but sons who have been born of God. God is our Father because He has begotten us, and we are His sons because we have been born of Him. Just as a child shares the life and nature of his father but not the fatherhood, so we as sons born of God share God&rsquo;s life and nature but not His fatherhood nor His Godhead. We are the same as God our Father in life and nature, but we surely are not God in His Godhead or the Father in His fatherhood. This is the intrinsic revelation of the Bible, especially of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In our daily living, we need to remember our status as sons of God possessing the life and nature of God. For example, if a brother and his wife both realize this, knowing that they are not only human but also divine, they will respect each other to the uttermost. Instead of disputing, they will honor each other and be kind to each other. Also, this realization will keep them from losing their temper. When we are tempted to lose our temper, we need to remember that we are sons of God. Even in such a matter as shopping in a department store, we should not forget our status as sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST COMING AS THE DESIRE OF THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>In His second coming, Christ will also be the Desire of the nations (Mal. 3:1; Hag. 2:7). Christ is the One whom we desire. Day by day we desire Him to be our love, our humility, our meekness, and our joy. Nothing is better than joy. This joy becomes our strength, our healing, our feeding, and our nourishment. Real joy comes from Christ being our life, our virtues, and our everything. I can testify that I have been loving this One for over seventy years, and I love Him today much more than ever. Daily I desire Him, love Him, and consider Him. He surely is our Desire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST COMING AS THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br />
WITH HEALING IN HIS WINGS</h2>
<p>As the Sun of righteousness, Christ will come with healing in His wings (Mal. 4:2). Today the Pentecostal people practice what is called divine healing. Actually, Christ Himself is our healing. He is the Sun that heals us as it shines upon us.</p>
<p>In His first coming, the earth rejected Christ; therefore, the earth lacks His healing. But because we have received Him in a secret, hidden way, we receive His healing every day. His healing causes us to have joy so that we forget our anger and anxiety. We are sick from sin, death, and many deficiencies and imperfections. Only this healing Christ can make us whole. To be healed is to be saved. To be healed, to be saved, is to be made whole. He will heal us, but we must give Him the freedom to use His wings to fly above us, around us, and within us.</p>
<p>In His first coming, Christ healed the degraded priesthood, but in His second coming, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel. Then He will be everything to the earth and to us. This healing Christ will come suddenly. Thus, we need to be alert, ready to receive Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTER OF THE BOOK OF MALACHI</h2>
<p>The center of the book of Malachi is the healing Christ. This healing Christ is the Messenger of God, the Angel of the covenant, and the Desire of the nations. Christ&rsquo;s being our healing is based upon His being the Sun of righteousness. The word &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; indicates life, and the word &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; indicates justice. The whole earth is filled with death and injustice, but with the healing Christ we have life and justice. We are waiting for Him to come as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON MALACHI</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALING<br />
WITH THE SONS OF JACOB</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mal. 3:5&mdash;4:6</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider Malachi 3:5&mdash;4:6.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALING<br />
WITH THE SONS OF JACOB</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah&rsquo;s Judgment by His Drawing Near</h2>
<p>Malachi 3:5 and 6 speak of Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment by His drawing near. In our experience, every time the Lord appears to us, He rebukes us. His rebuking is His judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. On Those Who Do Not Fear Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verse 5 tells us that Jehovah would be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired worker, the widow, and the orphan, against those who turn the stranger aside, and against those who do not fear Jehovah. Jehovah&rsquo;s concern for the stranger indicates that He is very human and that He is not happy when His people ill-treat a stranger instead of giving him hospitality.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Because of Jehovah&rsquo;s Not Changing,<br />
the Sons of Jacob Not Being Consumed</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says that Jehovah does not change; therefore, the sons of Jacob are not consumed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah&rsquo;s Advice to the Sons of Jacob</h2>
<p>In verses 7 through 12 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s advice to the sons of Jacob.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Instructing Them to Return to Him<br />
so That He Would Return to Them<br />
That They Might Be Blessed by Him</h2>
<p>&ldquo;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (v. 7). Here Jehovah instructed the sons of Jacob to return to Him so that He would return to them that they might be blessed by Him (vv. 10, 12). To be blessed by God is to be healed (4:2), and to be healed is to be made whole.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Not Robbing God in Tithes and Offerings</h2>
<p>Whereas Haggai touches the laziness of God&rsquo;s people in their not working to build God&rsquo;s house, Malachi speaks concerning their robbing God in tithes and offerings. &ldquo;Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me. But you say, How have we robbed You? In tithes and offerings. With the curse you are cursed, yet you, even the whole nation, rob Me&rdquo; (3:8-9). Here we see that after advising the sons of Jacob to return to Him, Jehovah charged them not to rob God in tithes and offerings that the curse would not be brought in to them. To rob God is to not give Him what He is due. He established the principle that of all the produce from the land, one tenth should go to Him (Lev. 27:30). The top tenth must go to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Bringing the Whole Tithe to the Storehouse<br />
That There May Be Food in God&rsquo;s House</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it&rdquo; (Mal. 3:10). Here we are told that when the first tenth is brought to the storehouse, God opens the windows of heaven and pours out a blessing until there is no room for it.</p>
<p>This verse speaks of food in God&rsquo;s house. This food is not for us&mdash;it is for God. God is hungry and needs food. What is God&rsquo;s food? God&rsquo;s food, the divine food, is the offerings, especially the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. The peace offering is enjoyed mutually by God and His people. We enjoy this offering before Him and with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jehovah Rebuking the Devourer for Their Sake</h2>
<p>In verse 11 Jehovah went on to say that He would rebuke the devourer for their sake, not allowing the devourer to destroy the fruit of the ground and not allowing the vine to lose its fruit in the field before it ripens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. All the Nations Calling Them Blessed,<br />
and They Being a Land of Delight</h2>
<p>According to verse 12, all the nations will call them blessed, and they will be a land of delight.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah&rsquo;s Encouragement<br />
to Those Who Fear Him and Serve Him</h2>
<p>In verses 13 through 18 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s encouragement to those who fear Him and serve Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Words of Some of the Sons of Jacob<br />
Being Strongly against Jehovah</h2>
<p>The words of some of the sons of Jacob were strongly against Jehovah (v. 13a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Saying That It Was Vain to Serve God</h2>
<p>They said, &ldquo;It is vain to serve God,&rdquo; and they asked, &ldquo;What profit is it that we have kept His charge and have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?&rdquo; (v. 14). They worshipped and served God, but they did it mournfully, not at all happy that they were required to do these things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Calling the Arrogant Blessed</h2>
<p>Those who spoke strongly against Jehovah also said, &ldquo;Now we call the arrogant blessed; not only have those who act wickedly been built up, but they also try God and escape&rdquo; (v. 15). This indicates that these opposers of God seemed to be saying, &ldquo;The way to be blessed is not to be humble but to be arrogant. The ones who act wickedly not only are built up, but they try God, not believing Him and not giving Him the tithe, and they escape from any kind of calamity. Instead of suffering, they escape tribulation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Word of Encouragement by Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 16 through 18 are the word of encouragement by Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Those Who Feared Jehovah Speaking to One Another</h2>
<p>Those who feared Jehovah spoke to one another, each to his neighbor, and Jehovah gave heed and listened (v. 16a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. A Book of Remembrance Being Written before Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verse 16b tells us that a book of remembrance was written before Jehovah of those who feared Him and considered His name. We today consider, love, regard, respect, and sanctify God&rsquo;s name, and He keeps a record of this. We may not remember our fellowship concerning Christ and the church, but God keeps a record of this fellowship in His book of remembrance.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Sons of Jacob<br />
Being Jehovah&rsquo;s Personal Treasure</h2>
<p>According to verse 17, the sons of Jacob will be Jehovah&rsquo;s. They will be a personal treasure in the day that He prepares (the day of His anger), and He will spare them, as a man spares his son who serves him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Sons of Jacob Returning<br />
and Discerning between Him Who Is Righteous<br />
and Him Who Is Wicked</h2>
<p>Finally, in His word of encouragement to those who fear Him and serve Him, Jehovah said that they will return and discern between him who is righteous and him who is wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him (v. 18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah&rsquo;s Warning by the Day of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Malachi 4:1-6 is Jehovah&rsquo;s warning by the day of Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Day Coming, Burning like a Furnace</h2>
<p>The day of Jehovah comes, burning like a furnace, and all the proud ones and all the ones who act wickedly will be stubble. The coming day will set them ablaze, so that it will not leave them root or branch (v. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Unto Those Who Fear<br />
Jehovah&rsquo;s Name the Sun of Righteousness<br />
Arising with Healing in His Wings</h2>
<p>Unto those who fear Jehovah&rsquo;s name the Sun of righteousness&mdash;the healing Christ&mdash;will arise with healing in His wings. They will go forth and leap about like well-fed calves. They will trample the wicked; for the wicked will be ashes under the soles of their feet in the day that Jehovah prepares (vv. 2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Charging the Sons of Jacob to Remember<br />
the Law of Moses, the Statutes and the Judgments</h2>
<p>In verse 4 the sons of Jacob were charged to remember the law of Moses, that is, the statutes and judgments. The law is the Ten Commandments; the statutes are detailed items of the law; and the judgments are ordinances. When a judgment is added to a statute, that statute becomes an ordinance. For example, the commandment to keep the Sabbath and not to profane it, lacking any mention of judgment, is simply a statute. But when a judgment is added, perhaps the sentence of death by stoning, the statute becomes an ordinance.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Promising to Send Elijah the Prophet to Them<br />
before the Great and Terrible Day<br />
of Jehovah Comes</h2>
<p>Finally, in verses 5 and 6, God promised to send Elijah the prophet to them before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes (Matt. 17:10-11; Rev. 11:3-4). Elijah will turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers, lest Jehovah comes and strikes the land with a curse. This is the closing word of Malachi and the last word of the Old Testament.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE REVIVAL REVEALED IN THE MINOR PROPHETS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hab. 3:2a; Hosea 6:2; Joel 2:28-29; Hag. 1:14; Mal. 3:1b; Hag. 2:7a; Heb. 7:22; Acts 26:18b; Col. 1:12; Mal. 4:2a; Rom. 8:20-22</h1>
<p>In this concluding message to the life-study of the Minor Prophets, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the revival revealed in the Minor Prophets. We may say that this matter of revival is the &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; within the &ldquo;shell&rdquo; of the books of the Minor Prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ASPIRATION OF GOD&rsquo;S ELECT</h2>
<p>Habakkuk 3:2a speaks of revival: &ldquo;O Jehovah, revive Your work / In the midst of the years.&rdquo; Among God&rsquo;s elect there has always been an aspiration to be revived. As long as you are a saved one, every day, consciously or unconsciously, there is an aspiration with a spontaneous prayer within you: &ldquo;O Lord, revive us.&rdquo; Although we may not realize it, such an aspiration has been within us through all the years of our Christian life.</p>
<p>We may think that Habakkuk&rsquo;s prayer for revival was good for him but has nothing to do with us. However, regarding his prayer, we need to realize that with God there is no time element. In the eyes of God, one person among His elect represents the whole. God always considers His elect as a corporate Body. This means that Habakkuk and we are one in the unit of God&rsquo;s elect. Thus, when Habakkuk prayed for revival, we also prayed. We prayed for revival twenty-six hundred years ago. Such a prayer is an everlasting prayer.</p>
<p>Many times in the last six years I charged the saints to put the God-ordained way into a living practice, but without a revival, how could we have anything living? If we endeavor to practice just the first step of the God-ordained way&mdash;to visit people for the gospel&mdash;without being revived, this will be a heavy burden that no one can bear. We all need to realize that we have been saved and kept on earth to do one thing&mdash;to go to disciple the nations, beginning from &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; and spreading to &ldquo;Judea,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Samaria,&rdquo; and to the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8). If we live for our education, a career, a good marriage, or a nice house, that is vanity of vanities. We are living here for the spreading of the Lord Jesus, not merely to our neighborhood but to the entire world. If we would do this, we need to be revived. This is why the Lord has led us to practice the morning revival.</p>
<p>This matter of morning revival is according to the natural law in God&rsquo;s creation. God created the universe so that there is a sunrising every twenty-four hours. We believers should follow the sunrising to be revived every morning. Every day we need a &ldquo;sunrising,&rdquo; and this sunrising is a revival. If we experience a daily revival, then we will be living and qualified to practice the God-ordained way and to help the church to take this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE DESOLATION OF THE &ldquo;TWO DAYS&rdquo;<br />
AND THE RESURRECTION ON THE &ldquo;THIRD DAY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Habakkuk prayed for revival; on the other hand, Hosea spoke of the desolation of the &ldquo;two days&rdquo; and the resurrection on the &ldquo;third day&rdquo;: &ldquo;He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up&rdquo; (6:2). Since to God a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8), these &ldquo;two days&rdquo; may refer to a period of two thousand years. For almost two thousand years, from the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70, Israel, our representative, has been desolate. From that year Israel lost the priesthood, the sacrifices, the prophets, the king, and the temple. Eventually, there will be the &ldquo;third day&rdquo;&mdash;the thousand years of the millennial kingdom&mdash;when Israel will be raised up, that is, restored.</p>
<p>The principle is the same in our Christian life. At a certain time we became desolate. After the two days of desolation, there is the third day, which signifies the pneumatic Christ in resurrection. Today we may receive the pneumatic Christ in resurrection and thus enjoy the reality of His resurrection. If we have the resurrected Christ, we are in the morning, the sunrising, and this is a real revival to us.</p>
<p>In 1984 I realized that the recovery was in a dormant condition, like the desolation of the two days in Hosea 6:2. However, if we experience a real revival, we will be in the third day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Joel 2:28 and 29 speak of the outpouring of the Spirit. Every day we need the outpouring of the all-inclusive, consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God. This all-inclusive Spirit includes Christ&rsquo;s divinity and humanity, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection. This Spirit is our portion, our inheritance.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESPONSE OF GOD&rsquo;S ELECT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people&rdquo; (Hag. 1:14a). Here we see the response of God&rsquo;s elect, who were stirred up by the Lord in the order of God&rsquo;s authority. When they responded by being stirred up in their spirit by the Lord, we all were included.</p>
<p>In the Minor Prophets there are both the divine Spirit, the consummated Spirit of God, and the human spirit, the stirred-up spirit of God&rsquo;s elect. The divine Spirit has been poured out, and our human spirit (the key to experiencing and enjoying Christ) responds to such a Spirit by being stirred up.</p>
<p>We may feel that our spirit was stirred up early in our Christian life but that it is no longer stirred up. However, this is not true. Unconsciously, the spirit of every regenerated believer is stirred up. If we go to a place of worldly entertainment, our spirit will be stirred up to tell us to leave that place. Whenever we grieve the Spirit (Eph. 4:30), we have no peace. This is the stirring up of our spirit. When we read the Bible, we feel calm and peaceful. Even in this calmness, our spirit is under the stirring up by the Spirit. Every day we cannot avoid the stirring up of our spirit. The Bible reveals that once the consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit comes into us, He will never leave. As He dwells in us, He is often a &ldquo;troublemaker,&rdquo; stirring us up either negatively or positively. If we take care of this negative or positive stirring up, we will be revived, and we will be strengthened and encouraged to carry out the God-ordained way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Minor Prophets also reveal that God&rsquo;s Christ is our enjoyment. The enjoyment of God&rsquo;s Christ is actually the enjoyment of God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. As the Desire of God&rsquo;s Elect</h2>
<p>We may enjoy Christ as the Desire of God&rsquo;s elect (Mal. 3:1b; cf. Hag. 2:7a). Whether we are hot or cold toward the Lord, we desire Christ. Can you say that you have no desire for Christ? Every day we desire Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. As the Angel of the Covenant</h2>
<p>We may enjoy Christ also as the Angel of the covenant (Mal. 3:1b). For Him to be the Angel means that He is a serving one. In His coming back, Christ will be the Angel of the covenant. He enacted the new covenant with His blood at His table (Matt. 26:26-29; Luke 22:20). In the new covenant, God is imparted into us as life and as our life supply, and we have the forgiveness of sins (Jer. 31:31-34).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Execute as Its Surety<br />
the New Covenant Enacted through His Death</h2>
<p>Christ not only enacted the new covenant through His death, but in resurrection He executes the new covenant as its surety (Heb. 7:22), making it real to us. In particular, He assures us that our sins have been forgiven and that we have Him as our life and life supply signified by the bread at the Lord&rsquo;s table. Day by day we may enjoy Him as the surety of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Dispense the Riches<br />
of the Covenanted Triune God into His Elect</h2>
<p>As the Angel of the covenant, Christ dispenses the riches of the covenanted Triune God into His elect. According to Acts 26:18b, we have received not only the forgiveness of sins but also &ldquo;an inheritance among those who have been sanctified.&rdquo; This inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people. The Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ, who is &ldquo;the allotted portion of the saints&rdquo; as their inheritance (Col. 1:12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. As the Sun of Righteousness</h2>
<p>Finally, Malachi 4:2 tells us that we may enjoy Christ as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. For Growing in Life,<br />
in the Dispelling of the Darkness</h2>
<p>As the Sun of righteousness, Christ is our enjoyment for growing in life, in the dispelling of the darkness. Just as the shining of the sunlight enables plants to grow, Christ&rsquo;s shining as the Sun of righteousness is for our growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. For Healing in Life,<br />
in the Effacing of Unrighteousness</h2>
<p>As the Sun of righteousness, Christ is our enjoyment also for healing in life, in the effacing of unrighteousness. Before we enjoy this healing in life, unrighteousness prevails, but through this healing unrighteousness is effaced and is replaced by righteousness.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2>
<p>At this juncture, I would like to give an additional word on the matter of revival.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Universal Aspiration for Revival</h2>
<p>The revival revealed in the Minor Prophets can be applied to the family, to the church, to the nations, to the entire human race, and even to the whole universe. In principle, everything and everyone on earth are in the desolation of the two days spoken of in Hosea 6:2.</p>
<p>Since the fall of man, there has been in all of creation an aspiration for revival. Concerning this, Romans 8:20-22 says, &ldquo;The creation was made subject to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.&rdquo; As a result of Adam&rsquo;s fall, corruption, slavery, and death have come into the whole creation. Today everything is decaying and is under the slavery of corruption. All the things that are under this slavery aspire to be revived.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ&mdash;the Reality of the Third Day</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s fall brought in corruption, and with corruption there is slavery. Because of this corruption and slavery, there is the need everywhere for revival, for restoration. This need can be met only by Christ and in Christ. Christ was resurrected on the third day, and as the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, He is the reality of the third day. Christ, therefore, is the element of the revival for which all of creation aspires. The corruption and desolation can be swallowed up only by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>Unbelievers as well as believers aspire to be revived, to have a new beginning. Everyone wants something new. Only Christ is the renewing factor. Only Christ, who rose up on the third day, is the renewing power. For the whole universe and for all of mankind, Christ is the reality of the third day.</p>
<p>When we received Christ, we received Him as the One who is Himself the resurrection (John 11:25). Immediately after receiving Him, we had a new beginning in our human life. That new beginning was a revival. However, eventually we again entered into a state of desolation and thus needed another revival. This cycle of desolation and revival, revival and desolation, has been repeated again and again.</p>
<p>The way to have the revival we need is to contact Christ, repenting and confessing our sins, failures, and darkness. By doing this we are brought from the desolation of the two days to the resurrection of the third day. Whenever we are in desolation, we need such a revival. We need to come to the third day, and the third day is nothing other than the person of the resurrected Christ with the reality of revival. In addition, we have the outpouring of the Triune God as the consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, and our spirit responds by being stirred up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ as the One Desired by Mankind</h2>
<p>When our spirit is stirred up in response to the outpouring of the Spirit, we enjoy Christ not only as the resurrected One but also as the One desired by all of mankind. He is mankind&rsquo;s unique need. Everyone, the believers and the unbelievers alike, desires Christ.</p>
<p>The Christ we desire has enacted the new covenant and He, as its surety, is now executing it. Through this covenant God has been allotted to us as our legal portion in Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings. Apart from Him, we have darkness and unrighteousness, but with Him everything is light and righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Restoration</h2>
<p>When we have such a Christ, we not only have revival&mdash;we have restoration. The millennial kingdom will be a time of restoration. This restoration will consummate in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center. That will be the ultimate, the consummate, restoration accomplished by the resurrected Christ.</p></body></html>
