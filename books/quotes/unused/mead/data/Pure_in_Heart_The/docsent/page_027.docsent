   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN SOME NECESSARY DEALINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SERVICE OF GOD DISCERNING DESIRE, INTENTION, AND ABILITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One who serves God must learn to discern three things: desire, intention, and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that a desire is something which man longs for.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An intention, to many people, refers to what man hopes for.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And of course, we all know that ability refers to the strength we need to accomplish a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person who serves the Lord must be dealt with in these three matters, or there will be a lack in his service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The desire to serve God is indispensable for every serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What God treasures the most is man s desire to serve Him and man s desire for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created the universe and all things, but His heart is not on the sun or the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither is His heart on the angels or on all the other things, because none of these things are for God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible tells us that man is the center of the universe cf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Zech 12:1 , and that without man the purpose of God cannot be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, even though God has created all things, His real concern and focus is man alone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The hardest thing for God to gain in man is his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This may be likened to a father who loves his son more than anything else but is not able to gain his son s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For us to cooperate with someone, our heart must be open to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has a great deal of work that He desires to do in the universe, but He must gain the cooperation of man to accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, to do this, He has to touch man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD DESIRING MAN S HEART TO LOVE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How does God touch man s heart?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What method does He use to move our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He uses His love to move our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is love?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Love is God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The heart is really a special thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we talk about the heart, we usually refer to love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The heart does not respond to thinking; it must be touched by love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God created us with a heart that we may feel such love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, when we are thirsty and someone gives us a glass of water, we drink it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when we are not thirsty, no matter how much water people give us, we would not drink it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s heart is like the glass of water, and our heart is the thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone responds to love because in man there is a heart of love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have a body without and a spirit within, and in between our spirit and our body is the soul, which includes the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s heart desires that man would love Him, but man s heart always loves something other than God, something that he should not love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of our age old or young some love their families, some love their pets, some love movies, some love to play mah-jongg, some love their reputation, some love position, some love knowledge, and some love money.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems that without love, man has no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wonderful thing is that once man has love, he is willing to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without love, however, it is difficult for him even to lift a finger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how dirty a child is, his mother is willing to take care of him because she loves him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A maid, however, may not be able to render the same care.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we read the Bible in a serious way, we should know that God s first demand on man is his heart, and second, his love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the very beginning until the end, God just wants man to be for Him, and God desires that man would love Him with his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The most legitimate love is the love for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our heart loves anything else, sooner or later we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people who love money are eventually bitten by money.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people who love others are cheated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible tells us that only those who love God really taste the sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Psalm 43:4 says, And I will go to the altar of God, / To God my exceeding joy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To those whose heart is turned to God, God is their joy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people love God so much that just hearing the name of God causes them to feel like they have received an electric shock.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the kind of heart toward Him that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, once we turn our heart to God and we are prepared to live for God, a problem will come.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a person has love, then he will also have an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may use as an illustration a time when I went to a certain place, and the saints there loved me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When they ate, they liked to put sesame oil in every single dish of food or bowl of soup.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, the more sesame oil they put into your dish, the more they welcomed you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, I did not like sesame oil; whenever I smelled sesame oil, I could not stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet at that time I had no choice but to eat it because we who work for the Lord have to keep a principle that wherever we go, we eat whatever people serve us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not only did they put sesame oil in my food, but regardless of whether I slept or went out, there was always a brother with me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result, I could not rest well or come near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They really loved much, but this kind of love was unbearable.</S>
