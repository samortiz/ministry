        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING TO BE THE LAMB WITH THE DOVE<br />
BEING BEYOND MAN&rsquo;S RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is beyond man&rsquo;s religious concepts. It is beyond the concepts of those in the Jewish religion of the Old Testament and even among many Christians in the New Testament age. A Christian may appreciate the Lord Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion, including His death on the cross and His shedding of blood for our sins. According to this understanding, however, the Lord Jesus is merely a kind and merciful Savior who delivers sinners from afflictions and rescues them from the lake of fire. The thought that the Lord died on the cross only out of a compassion to rescue condemned sinners from the lake of fire originates from deformed religious concepts. Many genuinely saved Christians have only a religious understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s work of redemption because they do not see clearly that God desires to mingle Himself with man and man with Himself. This desire was in God before man ever sinned.</p>
<p>In order to carry out His intention, God was incarnated and entered into man; the Word became flesh (v. 14). This is a marvelous, extraordinary matter. The Word became flesh and entered into man to fulfill God&rsquo;s original desire, which is to work Himself into man. Hence, there was a genuine man on the earth, and God was tabernacling in Him; the name of this man was Jesus. As the incarnated and tabernacling Word, God came to bring God into man and to bring man into God. This is the purpose of the Word becoming flesh in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In creation man was outside of God, and God was outside of man. This separation increased and, apart from a sacrifice for sin (Heb. 10:12; 9:12), was made irreconcilable because of sin. After the fall, man and God were even enemies (Rom. 5:10), and there was also a barrier between them related to sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self. All these items created an insurmountable distance between man and God. Given this distance, there was no possibility for God and man to be mingled together; God was truly unapproachable. In order to carry out His intention, God Himself came through incarnation in the person of Jesus. He came to bring God into man and man into God. In order to fulfill His purpose, the distance between man and God, created by sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self, had to be eliminated. The first step in eliminating this separation involved the incarnation. The second step involved the Lord Jesus, as the Lamb of God, shedding His blood on the cross and accomplishing an all-inclusive death that terminated sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self. His death eliminated the distance between man and God caused by sin. Then, in His resurrection from the dead, the Lord became the life-giving Spirit to enter into man and to bring man into God. As the Spirit, He brings man into God so that God can be in man and man can be in God. The Lord Jesus spoke of this in John 14, saying, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (v. 20). John also says, &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit&rdquo; (1 John 4:13). These words, which are altogether according to God&rsquo;s revelation, cannot be understood by a religious mind.</p>
<p>Our minds are full of religious concepts, especially the thought that the Lord Jesus is merely a kind and merciful Savior who delivers people from afflictions. According to God&rsquo;s revelation, however, we need to see that the Lord dwells in us and we dwell in Him. Hence, we need a change in our concept.</p>
<p>At the time of John the Baptist, Judaism was filled with religious concepts concerning the Messiah, the Prophet, Elijah, a Rabbi, and the King of Israel. The Lord Jesus was indeed the Messiah and the Prophet, and He was also a Rabbi who taught people, and John the Baptist even resembled Elijah. However, those who heard John the Baptist were full of religious concepts, and few saw that the Lord&rsquo;s coming was related to being the Lamb of God with the dove. The Gospel of John shows how the Lord turned His followers from their religious concepts so that they could see Him as the Lamb with the dove.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD TURNING HIS DISCIPLES&rsquo; CONCEPTS<br />
SO THAT THEY WOULD KNOW HIM<br />
AS THE LAMB WITH THE DOVE</h2>
<p>When two of John the Baptist&rsquo;s disciples heard his testimony, they followed the Lord Jesus. One of them was Andrew, Peter&rsquo;s brother, and the other was John (John 1:35-37, 40). Later, Peter and James, John&rsquo;s brother, also followed the Lord (vv. 41-42). Peter, Andrew, James, and John are mentioned first among the names of the twelve disciples in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke (Matt. 10:2; Luke 6:13-14). Peter and Andrew were a pair; James and John were another pair. Philip, who found Nathanael (John 1:43, 45), and Nathanael, who was also called Bartholomew (cf. Matt. 10:3), can be considered as another pair. These were the disciples who first followed the Lord.</p>
<p>When these disciples first met the Lord, they all had religious concepts. Their minds were filled with thoughts concerning the King of Israel and the Messiah. Andrew told Peter, his brother, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (John 1:41), and Philip said, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth&rdquo; (v. 45). Nathanael also said to the Lord, &ldquo;You are the King of Israel&rdquo; (v. 49). They spoke these words according to their religious concepts. However, the Lord is not presented in the Gospel of John as the Messiah or the King; rather, He is revealed as the Lamb of God with the Holy Spirit as a dove. The Lord Jesus came to be the Lamb of God in order to shed His blood for man&rsquo;s redemption and reconciliation to God; the Lord Jesus came also to be the dove so that redeemed and reconciled man could receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Beginning in chapter 2, every case that is recorded shows how the Lord Jesus did things contrary to religion so that the disciples would be turned from their religious concepts. In chapter 2 He is not spoken of as the Messiah or the King of Israel but as the One who can change water into wine, death into life (vv. 1-11). In chapter 3, when Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came to see the Lord Jesus, he addressed the Lord as Rabbi, thinking that the Lord came to be a teacher. However, the Lord Jesus responded, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God...You must be born anew&rdquo; (vv. 5, 7). The Lord also said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). The Israelites thought that the Lord Jesus came to be the Messiah or a teacher, but the Lord said that He came to be a bronze serpent. He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh (Num. 21:4-9; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>In John 4 the Lord asked a woman for water so that she could receive the living water of life (vv. 6-30). In chapter 5 He enlivened a man who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years, causing him to immediately rise up and walk (vv. 5-9). After doing this, He said, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life...The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo; (vv. 24-25).</p>
<p>In chapter 6 He performed a miracle by feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish. The Jews who saw it said, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world&rdquo; (v. 14). Then they tried to take the Lord Jesus by force to make Him King, but the Lord withdrew to a mountain by Himself (v. 15). When they found the Lord Jesus the next day, He said, &ldquo;You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled&rdquo; (v. 26). Then He said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever...He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life...The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (vv. 51, 54, 63). The Lord turned them to see Him as living bread that man can eat in order to live by Him.</p>
<p>In chapter 7 the Jews were celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles. On the last day of the feast, the Lord Jesus stood and cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). In chapter 8 the Lord Jesus was face to face with a sinful woman who was caught in the act of adultery, but He did not condemn her; instead, He empowered her to be freed from her sin (vv. 3-11). In chapter 9 the Lord Jesus anointed a blind man&rsquo;s eyes with clay made of spittle. When the man washed in the pool of Siloam, he came away seeing (vv. 6-7). In chapter 11 Lazarus died and was buried for four days and even smelled (v. 39). The Lord Jesus said only a brief word, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; (v. 43), and Lazarus was resurrected and came out of the tomb (v. 44). In all these cases, the Lord did not reveal Himself as the King, the Messiah, or the Prophet. Rather, His actions showed His desire to eliminate the distance between man and God by taking away the sin of the world as the Lamb and by giving man the Holy Spirit as the dove. Because the Lord Jesus is the Lamb with the dove, man can receive the Holy Spirit, and God can enter into man and man into God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to be the Lamb of God to die on the cross. Like many of us today, however, none of the disciples understood the Lord&rsquo;s intention. When He was on the road to Jerusalem to be killed, James and John asked Him, &ldquo;Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory&rdquo; (Mark 10:37). Although they had followed the Lord from the beginning of His ministry, they still had a concept that the Lord Jesus came to bring in the kingdom and to be the King of Israel.</p>
<p>On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, He told His disciples that it was time for Him to depart from the world and return to the Father. This filled His disciples with sorrow. Then the Lord Jesus told them not to be disturbed or sorrowful; furthermore, He said, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you&rdquo; (John 16:7). The Comforter is the Holy Spirit. When the Comforter came, He entered into the disciples, and when the Holy Spirit entered into the disciples, the Lord Jesus entered into them. The Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (14:18-20). He also said that in that day their heart would rejoice (16:22). However, at that time the disciples could not receive His word because of their religious concepts concerning the coming Messiah and King. This is the reason that they asked about sitting on His right and on His left. Since they did not understand the preciousness of being in Christ and of Christ being in them, their hearts were filled with sorrow (v. 6).</p>
<p>Even though the disciples did not understand or treasure what the Lord revealed, He still came among the disciples after His resurrection, showing them His pierced side and breathing into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (20:19-22). The Lord&rsquo;s pierced side spoke of Him being the Lamb, and the Lord&rsquo;s breathing into them spoke of Him being the dove. The end of the Gospel of John altogether reveals that the accomplished work of the Lord involves the Lamb with the dove, which the disciples did not understand.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came to the disciples in resurrection in Acts 1, they still asked a question according to their old concept, saying, &ldquo;Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo; (v. 6). Immediately the Lord Jesus interrupted and said, &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set by His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). The Lord told them not to ask concerning the restoration of the kingdom of Israel. Rather, He wanted them to know that they would be empowered to be His witnesses, because He had died for them as the Lamb and would come upon them as the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the disciples received a revelation in the Holy Spirit (2:1-4). On the day of Pentecost, Peter, James, and John no longer spoke of sitting on the Lord&rsquo;s right and left. When they stood and preached, they spoke of the Lord as the Lamb with the dove. When the crowd heard these words and were pricked in their heart, they asked Peter, &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; (v. 37). Peter&rsquo;s reply did not mention the Messiah or the kingdom of Israel; rather, he said, &ldquo;Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 38). The forgiveness of sins was accomplished by the Lord as the Lamb, and the giving of the gift of the Holy Spirit was accomplished by the Lord as the Lamb with the dove. From the day of Pentecost, the disciples turned from their religious concepts, and they preached, testified, and cried out according to the revelation of the Lamb with the dove. They did not strive for the throne; instead, they were willing to suffer death for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. The first martyr among them was James, the brother of John. This shows that the disciples turned from their religious concepts.</p>
<p>When Peter wrote his Epistles, he did not speak of the Messiah or the kingdom of Israel. Rather, he says that the believers were &ldquo;chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:2). The sprinkling of the Lord&rsquo;s blood refers to the work of the Lamb, and the sanctification of the Spirit refers to the work of the dove. In chapter 2 Peter says, &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness&rdquo; (v. 24). Then in chapter 3 he says, &ldquo;Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit&rdquo; (v. 18). In chapter 4 Peter says, &ldquo;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you&rdquo; (v. 14). This is Peter&rsquo;s testimony in his last days. All of his speaking is related to the Lord being the Lamb with the dove.</p>
<p>The testimony in the Epistles of the apostle John also clearly speaks of the Lamb and the dove. First John 1:7 says, &ldquo;The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&rdquo; In chapter 2 he says, &ldquo;If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sin&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). These verses refer to the Lamb. However, in verse 27 John speaks also of the anointing, saying, &ldquo;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you.&rdquo; This refers to the Holy Spirit, the dove. In 3:24 he says, &ldquo;He who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&rdquo; This also speaks of the dove. In 1 John there is no reference to the Messiah or the kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the disciples dropped their religious concepts and received revelation. They saw that the Son of God is the Lamb with the dove, bringing God to man by solving the problem of sin and removing the distance between man and God so that man and God can draw near to each other and God can be wrought into man and man can be wrought into God.</p>
<p>The disciples not only had revelation but they also had experience. The Lord Jesus solved their problem of sin, the Spirit entered into them, and they dwelt in the Holy Spirit, in God. There was no barrier between them and God; they were mingled with God as one. Their problem of sin was solved because of the Lamb, and they received God because of the dove. Their experience was altogether related to the Lamb with the dove, not the Messiah, the King of Israel, or the Prophet. The Lamb delivers man from sin, and the dove enables man to receive God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
