   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All those who would come before God to minister to Him must answer to God's holiness, righteousness, and even His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, focuses on these three things: God's holiness, God's righteousness, and God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's glory refers to God Himself; God's holiness refers to His nature; and God's righteousness refers to His way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, God's way is righteous, God's nature is holy, and God Himself is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every time we come before God, we must first realize how we are able to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is holy and righteous!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can sinners like us meet Him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can meet Him because the blood is here, remitting and cleansing us from our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, we can approach God without any conflict because His blood has cleansed us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, He is not only holy and righteous; He is also glorious in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, there is a need to offer the fat, which is to offer up our very best to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, the blood deals with everything in the old creation, and the fat speaks of everything in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blood dispels everything of the old creation, so that we no longer have a problem concerning holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fat is of the new creation, which signifies the offering of ourselves to God, so that we no longer have a problem with God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot minister to God if we do not know death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Death is not a doctrine or a theory from the Bible; it is poured out through a genuine trust in Him and in the pouring out of His incorruptible blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When His incorruptible blood was poured out, we too were poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now our Lord has no blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He only has a body with bones and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything of the natural life was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord's blood was poured out, everything of the soul-life was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He indeed poured out His soul unto death Isa 53:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the significance of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The pouring out of the blood is the removal of everything natural.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will speak more concerning this matter later.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we want to minister before God, we need to draw near to Him, stand before Him, and wait for His will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please remember these two indispensable matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, we must continually pour out "our blood" we must continually acknowledge that everything we have by birth and lose by death has been poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many frequently ask me what the natural life really is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I often answer them by saying that everything that comes with birth and goes with death is of the natural life; everything that exists between birth and death is the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has already poured out everything of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, He has poured out everything that we obtained and everything that came by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord poured out His blood, He did not only pour out His own life, but ours as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we have to continually stand on this fact and deny our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, this is altogether not a doctrine but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything of the natural life is thus dropped before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, this is a goal that we can attain to because, in Christ, everything of the soul has been poured out so that it is now possible for us to be selfless.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord, we can be selfless because Christ poured out our self when He poured out His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By ourselves, this is impossible; we cannot crucify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank the Lord that the Son of God has accomplished this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By Him we can die, and by Him we can give up our self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it is not sufficient just to die, because death is only the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our focus before God is not only on death but also on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He arose, we were in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Him, we became a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He not only died but also rose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He lives unto God; therefore, all that He is, is for God's satisfaction and not for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, this is what God wants to show us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what it is to minister to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must offer Him the fat and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 16 says, "They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This verse tells us that there is a place to minister to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ministry to the Lord is in the sanctuary a hidden, quiet place not public like the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, may He grace us so that we would not consider it a suffering to be in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually, a day there is better than a thousand days in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet we are always afraid of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How good it is to be in the outer court!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone can see us there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How good it is to be in the outer court!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They all know us there.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How good it is to be in the outer court!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our names are well known, and there is no attack or slander there, only a welcome and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But God wants us to be in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we are in that place, others may say that we are lazy and not doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In reality, what is done there is far superior to the work of ministering to the people in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Have you heard others criticizing you for being small and narrow?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Have you heard others say that you will not do this or that?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Others may say that you are too lazy to work and that you have left many things undone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But brothers and sisters, our hearts are not narrow at all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not asking anything of men, and we do not want to stand at the gate for many to see.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have only one goal, which is to minister to the Lord in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brothers and sisters, we are not willing to minister in the house because our hope and our task are greater than this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>No one here is as ambitious as Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He had one ambition, which was to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The things we are seeking here are greater than many other things, and our labor here is greater than that of many who do great works.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The fact is that our heart is broader than anyone else's. Brothers, do not think that we are too small and narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are very broad, for we are not only ministering to the house but to the Lord as well.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Of course this is not that great in the sight of man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brothers and sisters, we would rather let others criticize us than to move without God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have only two positions here: one is that we are dead and have dropped everything of the old creation; the other is that we are resurrected and are serving God, learning to stand before Him, listening to His order, and waiting in His presence to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We do not care for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>O brothers and sisters, is God's will enough to satisfy you?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Is it enough to do His will?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Is His will good enough?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Or are you still pursuing other things?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Are all of God's plans for you good enough?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Oh, you must learn to minister to God in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since time is so short and we also have to cover Luke 17, I cannot share in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I have said earlier that I wanted to mention three things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One is the difference between ministering to the house and ministering to the Lord; another is the way to minister to the house and the way to minister to the Lord; and the third is the requirements and condition of one who ministers to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Now let us consider the requirements of one who ministers to the Lord.</S>
