   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. The Position of the Church in God's Plan</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's purpose concerning the church must be viewed from eternity, from God's desire and from God's plan, for everything in God's plan is related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In eternity, God had a plan, and this plan is to produce in the universe the church, which comes out of the created beings, the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This church is to be His mystical habitation and a Body for His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the position of the church in God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Nature of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The nature of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as the nature of a table is wood and the nature of a microphone is metal, so the nature of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ Himself is the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, if someone asks you what is the nature of a book, you would answer that its nature is paper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he brings you some clothes and asks you what is their nature, you would answer that they are made of cloth or of silk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose someone asks you about the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The elders must be able to tell right away what the nature of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have to know it themselves, and they have to help the brothers and sisters to know it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Function of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the function of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The podium here has the nature of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The blackboard also has the nature of wood, as does the chair.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, although their nature is the same, their functions are different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The podium is used by people to speak from.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The blackboard is used by people to write on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The chair is used by people to sit on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The nature of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But what is the function of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In simple terms, it has two functions: on the one hand, it is the Body of Christ, for the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, it is the habitation of God, for God to have a dwelling place in the universe, and particularly on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the God-ordained functions of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, God wants to express Himself in the universe among His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This expression is in His Son and through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church here is the Body of His Son, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such, it has become a means of God's expression in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A man is expressed through his body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you take the body away and leave the soul there, there is no way for him to express himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the same way, the church is the Body of Christ and the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, it is God's expression in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, the church is also the habitation God has secured for Himself in the universe and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is God's house.</S>
