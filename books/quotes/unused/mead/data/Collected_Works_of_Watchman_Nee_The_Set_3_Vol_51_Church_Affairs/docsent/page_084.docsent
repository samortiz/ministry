   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Purpose Being for Service</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A certain brother asked me if it is good to have a second job.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time I answered that it is good and that it is all right to take up a second job.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this is not the question.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The question is what is your primary work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before God a person must have an intention and a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said that his intention, his desire, or we may say, ambition, and goal were to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What was his purpose and ambition?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said, "To gain the honor of being well pleasing to Him'' 2 Cor 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first question you need to answer today is, "Why are you doing business?''</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Is it to earn money or to be rich?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people want to become rich and not just earn money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even many physicians in Shanghai are not simply for earning money but for becoming rich.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our purpose before God is not to become rich, but to earn money, to have a little income, and to support the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This foundation must be established first.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must make a decision within yourself as to what you really want before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul said he wanted to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today before the Lord I have only one purpose: I want to serve Him, and I want His work to be done well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Occupation Being a Minor Issue</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today all the brothers and sisters must deal with this issue we must give all to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I tell you, if we do so, the matter of occupation is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What you do is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are not strong before the Lord and your service to God is not strong, your situation is like a work of silk weaving which cannot be touched without rending it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once you touch it, there will be a tear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If before the Lord your service to Him is strong, even if you go back to work, the way is still open.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps certain brothers may return to be physicians, to embroider, or to make hair nets.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if this is something you do on the side in order to support your service, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will not cause a problem for your ministry, because you are not in that occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, soon our brothers will go back to take care of a linen or embroidery business.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are prepared to sell the product in order to use all that they have to support their office before God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their function before God is so pressing and critical that everything else they do is to help their function.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again, there may be a person who has a hair net or embroidery business.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has set his heart and mind to become rich, yet he says, "I am the same as the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because I want to be rich, I assume that the other brothers also desire to be rich and that there is no difference between us.''</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I tell you, before God his way is wrong, and the carrying out of his office will be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His purpose is to become rich, but our purpose is not to become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All occupations can be carried out in the same manner, but our way is for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Serving God in Whatever We Do</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I want to serve God, I must serve God in whatever I do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to give all to this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only not making tents is for being an apostle, but even making tents is for being an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only not fishing is for being an apostle, but even fishing is for being an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, I hope none of the brothers who are apostles would change their priority before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I also hope that none of the brothers who are serving God in the localities would change their priorities either.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Serving God is our career, our basic career.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever I do is for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not making money is to serve God, and making money is also to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Designating a certain portion of my time is also for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I walk in this way without an obstacle, I am serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I walk in this way, find an obstacle, and change my means of walking, I am also serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I would even give my life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, the issue is settled.</S>
