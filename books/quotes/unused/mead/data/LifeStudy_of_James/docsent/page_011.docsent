   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEMPTED BY LUST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>James 1:13 says, Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, and He Himself tempts no one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word for tempted here also means tried, tested.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word for trials or trial in verses 2 and 12 is peirasmos, and for tempted is peirazo.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The two words are very close, both meaning to try, to test, to prove.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be tried, tested, proved, by outward environmental suffering is a trial v. 2 . To be tried, tested, proved, by inward lustful enticing is a temptation v. 14 . The trial is dealt with in verses 2 through 12; the temptation is dealt with in verses 13 through 21.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As for the trial, we should endure it by loving the Lord to obtain the blessing the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As for temptation, we should resist it by receiving the implanted word to obtain salvation, the salvation of our soul v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 13 James says that God cannot be tempted of evil and that He Himself tempts no one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here tempted in Greek is apeirastos, untried, hence, not temptable, not to be tempted, incapable of being tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word for tempt here is peirazo.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Devil, not God, is the tempter Matt 4:3; 1 Thes 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 14 and 15 James continues, But each one is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own lust; then the lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin; and the sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tempter, the Devil, is the begetting father of sin 1 John 3:8, 10 , who has the might of death Heb 2:14 through sin 1 Cor 15:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He injected sin into Adam, through which death passed to all men Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our Christian life we are tried by two categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first category is positive, and the second category is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first category includes trials and sufferings that test and prove us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Persecution, suffering, and a poor environment try us, test us, and prove where we stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second category, which is negative, includes temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, your colleagues at work may be used by Satan to tempt you to engage in a certain form of worldly activity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may also be tempted in many other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps a neighbor has bought a new car.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you see that car, you desire to have one like it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Like trials, temptations also test us and prove us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be tested by outward environmental suffering is a trial, but to be tested by the enticing of inward lust is a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The invitation to engage in worldly activities or the sight of someone s new car may stir the lust within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not a trial; it is a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to endure trials, but we need to resist temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to endure trials, we need wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, wisdom is not sufficient for us to resist temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to resist temptation, we need the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our Christian life temptations are more frequent than trials.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may have trials periodically, but we may have temptations daily, even hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes temptations come one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For instance, at school a young person may be tempted when he sees a classmate with a special kind of pen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Immediately, he is tempted and desires to have a pen like that one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason something like a pen can become a temptation to us is that we have the germs of lust within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we did not have these germs in us, nothing could be a temptation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the lust in us that causes so many things to be temptations to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What we need to resist is not actually the thing that tempts us, but the lust within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we have pointed out, wisdom is not sufficient for this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may have wisdom, yet not have the power to resist lust.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would resist the lust in us, we need another life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>REBORN THROUGH THE WORD OF TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we shall see, verse 18 says that our Father has brought us forth, regenerated us, by the word of truth, which is the word of divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we heard the gospel, we heard the word of God s reality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we received this word, we were reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through the divine birth the divine life was imparted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we not only possess the divine life, but we are enjoying this life with its divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This life is the strength, the inner power, by which we can resist the germs of lust that are within us.</S>
