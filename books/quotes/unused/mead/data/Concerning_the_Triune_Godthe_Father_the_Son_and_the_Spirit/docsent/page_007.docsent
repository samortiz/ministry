   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Besides Matthew 28:19 and the Gospel of John, the following places in the New Testament also reveal to us the trinity of the Godhead either implicitly or explicitly:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 6:9-10: Here the Lord teaches the believers to pray by expressing a threefold wish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is without a doubt due to the fact that the God to whom the Lord wants the believers to pray is one-in-three.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The name for which prayer is made in the first place is related to God the Father; the kingdom for which prayer is made in the second place is related to the Son; and the will for which prayer is made in the third place is related to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This can be easily realized according to the teachings elsewhere in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 12:4-6: Here we read that the "Spirit" of gifts, the "Lord" of ministrations, and the "God" of workings all three are related to God's inspiration upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Corinthians 13:14: Here we read that the grace of the "Lord Jesus Christ," the love of "God," and the fellowship Gk. of the "Holy Spirit" all three are with us at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Peter 1:2: Here we read that the election of "God the Father," the sanctification of the "Spirit," and the sprinkling of the blood of "Jesus Christ" all three have caused us to obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Each of the three passages above, whether it is concerned with the inspiration of God upon us, the apostle's benediction for us, or the salvation which we obtain, mention God, the Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This proves not only that all three are God, but also that the three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 1:4-5: Here we read, 1 "From him who is and who was and who is to come"; 2 "from the seven Spirits that are before his throne"; and 3 "from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This clearly reveals that God is three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 4:8: Here we read that the four living creatures in the heavens give threefold praise to God, saying, "Holy, holy, holy."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Old Testament, the priests on earth blessed the people with a threefold blessing, and the seraphim in the heavens praised God by uttering "holy" three times; likewise, in the New Testament, the believers on earth pray by expressing a threefold wish, and the four living creatures in the heavens praise by saying "holy" three times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This evidently is because the God to whom they pray and whom they praise is one-in-three.</S>
