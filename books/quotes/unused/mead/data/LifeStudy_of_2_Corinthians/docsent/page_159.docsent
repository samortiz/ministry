   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN PAUL S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 8 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 12:19 13:10 SPEAKING BEFORE GOD IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 12:19 Paul says, All this time you are thinking that we are defending ourselves to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before God, in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, are for your building up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Along with the Corinthians, we may think that in these chapters Paul is defending himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The title of this group of messages even speaks of Paul s vindication of his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apparently in these chapters Paul is vindicating himself; actually, he is neither vindicating himself nor defending himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this verse Paul says that he speaks before God and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ denotes the life by which the apostles speak; it refers to the means and substance of their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before God denotes the atmosphere in which the apostles speak; it refers to the sphere of their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It may seem that Paul is not consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 11:17 he says that he speaks not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now he says that he speaks before God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not think Paul would defend himself against the charge of being inconsistent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Either we understand him or we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul knew what he was doing and what he was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we also are accused of being inconsistent and contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider Paul s situation in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he was speaking as it were in foolishness, he said that he did not speak according to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, Paul was saying that his foolishness, and not the Lord, was the motivation of his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in 12:19 he says that he speaks in Christ, by Christ as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He also says that he speaks before God, that is, in God as the sphere of his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here Paul seems to be saying, I am not defending myself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, I am speaking by Christ as my life and before God as my atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, I speak for the sake of your building up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All things, beloved, are not for our vindication, but are for your building up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would like to spend and be spent utterly for you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I don t care to defend myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I care for you and for your building up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the focus of my concern.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am not trying to convince you to receive me as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My concern is that you be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as you are built up, I will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am willing to give anything for this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A LIST OF NEGATIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 20 says, For I fear, that perhaps when I come, I may find you not such as I wish, and I may be found by you not such as you wish: that perhaps there may be strife, jealousy, angers, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, puffings up, disorders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul s desire for the Corinthians was that they would be in Christ, live Christ, and be built up as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Paul was concerned that when he came to them, he would find them not such as he wished.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, he realized that the Corinthians might find him not such as they wished, for it might be necessary for Paul to be bold toward them and to discipline them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, it would seem that he was not tender or loving.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 20 Paul mentions strife, jealousy, angers, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, puffings up, disorders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these are characteristics of people living in the flesh for their own interests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Greek word rendered strife also means debate, contention, quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, the word for backbitings means detractions or evil speakings, and that for whisperings means secret slanders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By puffings up Paul means inflated arrogance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Greek the word is a kindred word to puffed up in 1 Corinthians 4:6.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word for disorders may also be rendered disturbances.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse Paul is saying to the Corinthians, If you are such persons, I will be put to shame when I come to you again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have been serving you and ministering to you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have already written one epistle to you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I find that you are full of strife, jealousy, angers, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, puffings up, and disorders, I will be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God would humble me, and I would have to ask Him for mercy because of the pitiful result of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It would surely be a shame to me if these things are still among you when I come.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 21 Paul continues, Lest when I come again my God should humble me in regard to you, and I shall mourn over many who have sinned before and are not repenting of the uncleanness and fornication and debauchery which they practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this verse there is no doctrine or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we have in this portion of 2 Corinthians is something related to the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many of today s Christians do not pay attention to these chapters, because they do not feel the need for them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The reason they do not sense a need is that they do not have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But these chapters are needed by those in the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We thank the Lord that, under His mercy, we do know our need for these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be conscious of our need is a sign that we are under the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In verses 20 and 21 Paul mentions eleven negative things: strife, jealousy, angers, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, puffings up, disorders, uncleanness, fornication, and debauchery.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some may wonder how it is possible for such things to be found in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Oh, we need to wake up and not have a dream concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, we need to consider our own situation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With you is there ever any backbiting or criticizing?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Perhaps when a certain person stands up in the meeting, you may say quietly to yourself, There he is again.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is this not a kind of whispering?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do you have any strife or jealousy, any anger or rivalry?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Can you say that in the church life you have not been in rivalry with others?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The items mentioned in verse 20 may be somewhat polite sins rather than gross sins.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who are more cultured will criticize others behind their backs.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who are cultured and refined do not criticize others in a crude way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, they may whisper about them and backbite.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Furthermore, we need to check whether or not we are puffed up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Inwardly we may have a puffed-up spirit, and we may display this outwardly in our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even though you may be educated, refined, and cultured, you cannot hide your arrogant attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Along with the more refined sins in verse 20, Paul names three gross sins in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is possible for all these sinful things to creep into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This was the reason Paul said that he feared coming to Corinth and seeing such things still present among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>That would have been a shame to him and to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Chapter twelve of 2 Corinthians has no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>With the kind of practical speaking we have here, it is difficult to have a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The matter is left open for further consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Hence, in chapter twelve Paul does not give a concluding word.</S>
