   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-SEVEN THE CHURCH AS GOD S WARRIOR Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-18 VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 1 we have a general view of what the church is and how the church comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then in chapter two we see that the church is the new man created by Christ in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter three we have a clear vision of Christ making His home in the hearts of those in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For Christ to make His home in the heart of the church means that He is transfused into the center of the church s inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through such a transfusion, the church is filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way the church is mingled with divinity and saturated with it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the church is humanity mingled, saturated, and permeated with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter four we see the church as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The new man in chapter two is organically complete, but not functionally perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be functionally perfect, the church as the new man must grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more the new man grows, the more he will be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Ephesians 4 we also see the daily walk of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have pointed out, fallen mankind walks according to the vanity of the mind, but the walk of the church as the new man is in the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Ephesians 5 we see another aspect of the church the church as the Bride prepared for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In one sense, the church is the new man who needs growth, function, and a proper daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In another sense, the church is the Bride who must be beautified in order to be presented to Christ at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the church as the Bride, the problem is not with ordinances, doctrine, or the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem is with the spots and wrinkles, defects that are organic and that ruin the beauty of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to be free from such defects, the church must be sanctified, purified, nourished, and cherished by having the element of Christ wrought into her metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This element will cause the spots and wrinkles to disappear, and it will beautify the Bride for her presentation to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, through this process of metabolic transformation the church will become glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BRIDE AND THE WARRIOR</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 6 we see still another aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter the church is not the Body, the building, the family, the kingdom, the new man, or the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here the church is God s warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church should be not only the Body to express Christ, the dwelling place for God s habitation, and the new man for the fulfillment of God s economy; the church must also be a warrior, a soldier, to defeat God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Revelation 19, the church is both the Bride who is presented to Christ and the warrior who fights with Him against God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At His coming again, the Lord Jesus firstly will meet His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After receiving the Bride, Christ and the overcomers will enter into battle against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Revelation 19:11, the Lord will ride on a white horse, and the armies which are in heaven will follow Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and pure v. 14 . Revelation 17:14 also refers to this: These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Revelation 19:7 and 8 we see that the Bride is clothed in fine linen, bright and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in verse 14 we see that the armies which follow the Lord into battle are dressed in fine linen, white and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These verses indicate that the Bride s wedding garment will also be the uniform she wears as God s army to fight against His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, to have the wedding garment is also to have the uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Ephesians 5 and 6 we see the church as the Bride and as the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Revelation 19 we also have these two aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the church, we are not only the Body, the dwelling place of God, the kingdom of God, the family of God, and the new man; we are also the Bride and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Bride, we must be beautiful, without spot or wrinkle, and be clothed in fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the warrior, we must be equipped to fight against God s enemy.</S>
