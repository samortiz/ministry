   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPLACEMENTS FOR CHRIST The Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians use the Bible as a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists that they searched the Scriptures but would not come to Him for life John 5:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is a testimony to Him, but apart from Him there is no life in the letter of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because they would not go to Him for life, their search of the Scriptures was only in the dead letter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our day many are like those Jews of old.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Students of theology read and study the Scriptures, yet many fail to touch the Christ who is in the Spirit and in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many ordinary Christians, too, faithfully read the Bible, yet they will not come to the One of whom it speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are using the Bible as a replacement for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Law</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The law of Moses was given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ came, the Jews quoted from the law and would not receive Him; it was their substitute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The believers in Galatia received Christ but then went back to embrace the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul wrote the book of Galatians to rescue them from its snare.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He reminded them that they were in Christ and had all His riches and grace as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With such abundant blessing, how could they go back to Judaism?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To do that was to cut themselves off from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were like a branch grafted into Christ, receiving the riches of the life of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To turn back to the law was to disqualify themselves from their position in Christ and to be brought to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It meant that they had fallen from grace Gal 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, the law was God-given; but its use was only temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once Christ came, the law was to be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They must remain in Christ and not turn back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may feel that you are not trying to keep the law, so that what I am saying does not apply to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you not, however, have your own laws?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Especially those with a strong will have a set of laws they determine to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have certain things you do and will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You consider yourself normal with a strong will, a clear mind, and proper emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your life consists of your self-made regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These laws, as well as the law in the Bible, become a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather than living by Christ, some people cherish tongues-speaking, or the gift of healing, or some other gift.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These gifts become a replacement of Christ.</S>
