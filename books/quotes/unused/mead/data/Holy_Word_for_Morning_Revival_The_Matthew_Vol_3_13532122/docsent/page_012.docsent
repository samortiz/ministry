   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 12 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 16:18-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>18 And I 1 also say to you that you are 2 Peter, and upon 3 this rock I will 4 build My 5 church, and the 6 gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>19 I will give to you the 1 keys of the 2 kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you 3 bind on the earth shall 4 have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you 3 loose on the earth shall 4 have been loosed in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20 Then He charged the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>18 1 The Father's revelation concerning Christ is only the first half of the great mystery, which is Christ and the church Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the Lord needed to reveal to Peter the second half also, which concerns the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>18 2 Or, a stone; material for God's building 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>18 3 This rock refers not only to Christ but also to this revelation concerning Christ, a revelation that Peter received from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is built on Christ and on this revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>18 4 The Lord's building of His church began on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:1-4, 41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet the Lord's prophecy here still has not been fulfilled, even up to the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord is not building His church in Christendom, which is composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This prophecy is being fulfilled through the Lord's recovery, in which the building of the genuine church is being accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>18 5 Gk. ekklesia, meaning an out-calling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word is used in reference to a called-out congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My church indicates that the church is of the Lord, not of any other person or thing; it is not like the denominations, which are denominated according to some person's name or according to some matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>18 6 Gates of Hades refers to Satan's authority or power of darkness Col 1:13; Acts 26:18 , which cannot prevail against the genuine church built by Christ upon this revelation concerning Him as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed human being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word of the Lord's indicates also that Satan's power of darkness will attack the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, there is spiritual warfare between Satan's power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>19 1 According to history there were two keys.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter used one on the day of Pentecost to open the gate so that the Jewish believers could enter the kingdom of the heavens Acts 2:38-42 , and he used the other in the house of Cornelius to open the gate so that the Gentile believers could enter Acts 10:34-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>19 2 Kingdom of the heavens is used here interchangeably for church, which is used in the previous verse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is confirmed by Rom 14:17, in which the kingdom of God is mentioned in obvious reference to the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>19 3 This Gospel is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church revealed in this book represents the kingdom with its reign.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself 18:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>19 4 Whatever the church people bind or loose on earth must be something that has already been bound or loosed in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can bind or loose only what has already been bound or loosed in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church that is built upon the revelation concerning Christ is the genuine church, and it is not sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we see this, we will be saved from division.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Any group that is built upon doctrines, views, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>567-568</S>
