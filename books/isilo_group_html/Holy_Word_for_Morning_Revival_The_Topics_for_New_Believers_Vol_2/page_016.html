<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Gen. 1:2 ...The Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Judg. 6:34 And the Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isa. 63:11 ...He who put in their midst His Spirit of holiness.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit</h2>
<p>According to the entire revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is for God&rsquo;s dispensing....God&rsquo;s desire with His strong intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their life, as their life supply, and as their everything. To carry out this dispensing He needs to be triune.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 2:13 God refers to Himself as the fountain of living waters; in John 4:14 Christ is the fountain of water springing up in the believers into eternal life; and in Revelation 22:1 the Spirit is the flow, the river of water of life. The Father is the fountain, the source, and the Son is the spring as the course to express the source. This course, this spring, issues in a flow, which is the Spirit as the reaching, the application, of the Triune God.<sup>72</sup></p>
<p>Among the three of the Trinity, the Spirit is the most important in the sense of His being the realization, application, and reaching of the Triune God to us.<sup>73</sup></p>
<p>God&rsquo;s move in man is altogether a story of the Spirit. Without the Spirit, there is no history of God because God is totally a matter of Spirit. The difference between God&rsquo;s move, God&rsquo;s act, God&rsquo;s work, and religions is that religions do not have the Spirit. They may have some spirits, but those spirits are demonic, devilish, and satanic. There is only one genuine, divine Spirit; that is God Himself.<sup>74</sup></p>
<p>In [this portion] on the Spirit we shall [only be able to cover in part] the Spirit&rsquo;s person, symbols,...and work.<sup>75</sup></p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Old Testament</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of God</h2>
<p>Every story in the Old Testament is related to God. The first story is concerning God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens and the earth, with millions of items, and His creation of man. In this story the Spirit of God is mentioned. Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Then the following verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.&rdquo; Thus, we see that the Spirit was the Spirit of God in God&rsquo;s creation of the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Jehovah</h2>
<p>After His creation, God began to work on man. In God&rsquo;s work on man, His name is <em>Jehovah.</em> The Spirit of Jehovah is in God&rsquo;s reaching of men and in His care for men (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; Gen. 6:3a)....<em>Jehovah</em> simply means <em>to be.</em> God was, God is, and God shall be forever. He is the great I Am.</p>
<p>God told Moses that His name was &ldquo;I Am Who I Am&rdquo; (Exo. 3:14). This means, &ldquo;I am always the thing which should be.&rdquo; If there is the need of light, He is the light. If there is a need of life, He is the life. He is everything. The Lord Jesus Himself told us that His name is &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; (John 8:58). The name <em>I Am</em> means that the very One who works on man is everything to man. He takes care of man and He comes upon man. This is <em>Jehovah</em> in His reaching of man and in His care for man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Holiness</h2>
<p>God is caring for man mainly to make man holy. To be holy means to be separated unto God.<sup>76</sup> <em>The Spirit of holiness</em> refers to the nature and essence of God....[Moreover,] <em>the Spirit of holiness</em> is a description of what God is.<sup>77</sup> Man&rsquo;s fall caused him to depart from God to become common, worldly, secular, and even dirty. So God needs to take care of man, making man separate from all things other than Himself. This is to make man holy. Thus, the Spirit in the Old Testament is the Spirit of holiness in God&rsquo;s making His chosen people holy unto Himself (Psa. 51:11; Isa. 63:10-11). This is not the same as <em>the Holy Spirit,</em> which is used in the New Testament. The Holy Spirit is more intensified than the Spirit of holiness.<sup>78</sup></p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
