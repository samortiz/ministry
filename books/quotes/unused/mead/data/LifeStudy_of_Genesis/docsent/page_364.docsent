   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was hard work for a young woman to draw water out of the well and pour it into the trough for ten camels to drink, but she did it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the young sisters want to be under God's sovereignty, especially with respect to their marriage, they need to be kind and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any young woman who is unkind and sloppy should remain single.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When people ask you to do one thing, you must do two things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And the second thing should far surpass the first thing.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Rebekah had never seen Isaac, she was willing to go to him without hesitation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She did not say to her mother, "Mother, I have never seen Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps I should correspond with him first and afterward have him pay us a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I could decide whether or not to marry him."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rebekah did not talk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although her brother and mother were hesitating, wanting her to stay for at least ten days, she said, "I will go."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She was absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the past forty years, I have seen a number of young sisters who developed mental problems as a result of considering marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some spent days, weeks, months, and even years considering whether a particular brother was the one whom God had prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When such sisters came to me, I said, with a rebuking tone, "If you feel he is the brother, marry him blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if he is not the one, forget about him and don't talk about it.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can I tell you yes or no?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I say yes, you will say that I do not know him well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I say no, you will feel unhappy because you have already fallen in love with him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Don't think about it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Either marry him or forget about him."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I was serious in telling them this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Young sisters, if you want to be married, you must learn to be kind, diligent, and absolute.</S>
