   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As for the translation of the New Testament, I think we need at least four different versions.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first is a paraphrase version, in which we use our own words to express the text.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not a word-for-word translation, and its emphasis is on the overall meaning of the text.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second is a revised version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will render a new translation of the present New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This version emphasizes the accuracy of the words as well as their meaning within the text.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This will be a proper translation of the text.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The third is an even more literal translation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, it will put the word and in front of a sentence when the Greek word kai is present e.g., Matt 15:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This version will be a Chinese rendering that is strictly based on Greek grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But these three versions are not enough; there is the need of a fourth version.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the fourth version we need to highlight some special words, such as the articles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Greek, some nouns have articles attached to them, while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In English, this would be rendered, for example, as "the Paul" in some instances.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to spend ten years to take care of these special expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a version will have a one-to-one correspondence between every Greek word and Chinese word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we can finish these within a few years, our next generation will be able to study the Bible better because they will have reference books in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who come after us will only need to compare the four versions to arrive at the proper meaning of a passage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is lacking today are reference books and proper versions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps Brother James not James Chen should stay with us to participate in the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It would be best to have a Chinese translation of the Bible which establishes proper spiritual terms.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are involved in the literature work must be very diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They cannot be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They must familiarize themselves with the expressions and styles of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the past we have published many spiritual writings, but we have not put out enough reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dictionary of the Bible by Mr. Wood is out of print.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can write him and ask him to reprint it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Chou Shing-yi and Brother James should give themselves to this literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Kuling we are working on two kinds of people specifically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first are the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second are the responsible brothers of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We expect those who stay in the dormitories to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The scattered bungalows can be prepared as lodgings and rest houses for the trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The weather can be unfriendly here on the mountain only during the months of December and January; the rest of the year it is very suitable for our training.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that Miss Kuo and Miss Zuo can stay here on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here on the mountain, we hope to meet according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone can say something, and at the end we can have some kind of judgment on a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The above is a general sketch of the work; it is not a kind of final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, we have the corporate view, but on the other hand, we take care of the individual's feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There needs to be a balance between the corporate and the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A FEW OTHER CONCERNS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Concerning the relationship between apostles and elders: If the elders in a locality are strong, they can join the apostles in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Concerning the places that are considered as centers: When the work grows to a certain point, the brothers and sisters have to be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We believe that as soon as some are sent out, more will come in to fill their places.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, Hong Kong has experienced a constant shift of population in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet its number has not decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning the gospel and the edification of new believers: We should have prepared over fifty topics for the gospel by now.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the coming days we hope to add more material to cover other areas.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We hope that the material used in the gospel meeting and the edification of new believers meeting will be unified throughout the country.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This will ensure that the brothers and sisters will continue along the same lines without any overlap or interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who are responsible for preaching the gospel and edifying the new believers must themselves live in the reality of their messages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, their messages will become like the formal prayers of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the work of edifying the new believers, the important thing is to track down the brothers and sisters one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not let them get away easily.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Concerning migration: If a church sends out saints for the migration, its number will not diminish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should encourage the matter of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Concerning serving together as the church: Before the war, there were a little over one hundred thousand converts to Catholicism, plus over five hundred thousand had been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This number equals the total number of Protestants gained during the past one hundred years, but the gospel work among the Protestants and the Catholics alike in China is far too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the whole church will rise up to preach the gospel today, the Lord will do a new thing in China.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you return to your locality, you must break through in this one thing get all the brothers and sisters in the church to rise up to work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Unless you can do this, your work is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have to make every piece of work in the church the responsibility of every brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The whole church has to be involved in the preaching of the gospel, the visiting of saints, or the edification of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the one-talented ones have to put in their share.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The whole church has to rise up to serve, and the whole church has to rise up to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Unless we do this, we are a big failure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to be very busy, yet at the same time, we have to make everyone else busy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I know this is very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are the only ones who are busy, and if all the works are in our hand, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the future if someone writes to us and says that the affairs of the church are on the shoulder of one person, we will say that of the seventy who were sent out by us for the work, this particular one has fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will all be clear about our way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must mobilize all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The whole Body has to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the testimony that the Lord is after.</S>
