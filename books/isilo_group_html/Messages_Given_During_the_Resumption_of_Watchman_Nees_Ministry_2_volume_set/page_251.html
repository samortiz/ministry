All the money that the brothers and sisters designate for a local church should be placed in the church offering box. What is designated for the poor brothers should be marked clearly as such. What is designated for individuals or for the work in another region should likewise be clearly marked. You can separate the offerings for local use and for the work by using two offering boxes, or the two can go into the same offering box. The church has full liberty to distribute these offerings in whatever way it chooses, and individuals have full liberty to give according to their faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEANING AND THE SPHERE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the meaning and the sphere of the church?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Aspects of the Church</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: There are two meanings to the word "church." The first is the universal church, and the second is the local church. The universal church is the general church, which includes the church of yesterday, today, here, and elsewhere. It even includes the church in the future. The local church is the church that appears in each locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Aspects of the Universal Church</H2><P>As to the universal church, there are also two aspects to it. One aspect refers to the church that includes all God's children both yesterday and today, both here and everywhere. However, we have to realize that today we are neither in yesterday, nor in the future. God's children are living on earth today. When all these children of God are added together, we also have the general church. What was there yesterday was past, and what will be there in the future is not here yet. Between the past and the future, there are all the children of God on earth today. God's children must not only practice the oneness in the locality, but they must learn to be one with all God's children on the whole earth today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Maintaining the Local Testimony<br>and God's Testimony on Earth As Well</H2><P>If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth. Today, we must not only maintain a local testimony; we must also maintain God's testimony on earth. We cannot isolate Shanghai and try to keep it out of trouble. Shanghai belongs to the general church on earth. The Body mentioned in 1 Corinthians is different from the Body mentioned in Ephesians 4. The Body in Ephesians 4 includes all the believers past and present, here and everywhere, but the Body in 1 Corinthians only refers to all the believers on earth at that time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning to Be One</H2><P>The church is local, whereas the work is regional. A local church cannot encompass the work of a region, because a region involves more than one local church. However, all the local churches plus all the regional works equal the general church. In order for us to practice the oneness of the church, we must practice the oneness of the general church. This requires that we learn to follow others and learn to be one.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_250.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_252.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 251</div><br></body></html>
