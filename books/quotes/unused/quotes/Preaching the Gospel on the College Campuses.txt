We have been opposed because we have dropped the creeds and the traditions of men to take the entire Word of the Bible
Martin Luther was also greatly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church because he refused to go along with their traditions and councils
We also must come back to the Word because the creeds are incomplete in their presentation of the divine revelation
If the opposers believe in the Bible, the truth will vindicate you, and the pure Word will convince many of them
We have to exercise our faith to believe that, according to the New Testament revelation, we are in the Spirit
The resurrected and ascended Christ as the Head of the church has already baptized all His believing members in the Spirit
In these two steps, all genuine believers in Christ have been baptized in the Holy Spirit into one Body once for all universally
In charismatic meetings, they sometimes use rock music, dramas, and all kinds of performances to attract people
On the island of Taiwan, no Christian work can compare or compete with the work of the Lord's recovery in the preaching of the gospel
The crucifixion of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit have been accomplished
If we are going to receive Christ's redemption accomplished through His death on the cross, we do not need to fast and pray
We can say, 'Lord, thank You for Your accomplished work of redemption and for Your resurrection and ascension'
When we say this by faith according to the written Word of God, we get redemption, resurrection, and ascension
The Spirit is here because the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have all been accomplished, and the Spirit has been poured out
The Lord is the Spirit , and according to Revelation 5:6 the Spirit has been intensified sevenfold and sent into the whole earth
You do not need to fast and pray, but you do need to open yourself to the Lord and have a renewed consecration
Exercise your faith to believe that the Spirit is in you and that you are in the Spirit, under the outpouring of the Spirit
You may think that you are too young, that you do not know very much, and that you do not have much experience in life
We should just exercise our faith to apply the word of the truth which says that we have been baptized in the Spirit
All the people who went back to Jerusalem under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah in the Old Testament were able to rebuild the temple
Those who remained in Babylon could not help with this rebuilding work because they were not on the proper ground
In the divisions, Christians may enjoy the Spirit a little, but there is no possibility of having the real Body life in any division
The young people's preaching of the gospel on the campuses, however, should be in coordination with all the saints
Since we may not have that many young ones, we need many homes of the saints for coordination in the gospel work
A young person who catches eighteen new ones should be able to bring all eighteen into the living rooms of the saints
It would be good for the older ones to buy the groceries, cook the food, and wash the dishes to serve the young people and their contacts
The young ones should go to the campus and the middle-aged saints should serve the young people in the living room
If all the churches practice preaching the gospel in the campus work in this way, we will have a prevailing church life
The older saints can stay home to prepare snacks refreshments and the best dinners to gather the new contacts at least once every four weeks
We need a young army that can be sent to the campuses to bring in more young people but all the older and middleaged saints are also needed
Because the local churches in the Lord's recovery are standing on the genuine ground of oneness, we can have a very good coordination
We have spent a great deal of time to discover the ways that the early apostles and disciples took to preach the gospel
Before the Lord departed, He instructed them to wait in Jerusalem until they received the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost
On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit came upon the disciples after much prayer and they were filled with the Spirit to speak the word of God
According to the New Testament, we should drop the Sabbath and other Jewish rituals , but we should not drop the prayer hour
After Peter and John were released by the Sanhedrin, they reported to the saints what the chief priest and the elders had said to them
The church prayed in one accord and 'they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness'
In an effort to stop the bold preaching of the apostles, the Sanhedrin arrested them again and threw them into prison
The Lord came to the imprisoned apostles and said, 'Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life'
In 1948 and 1949, when we were forced to leave mainland China and go to the island of Taiwan, we were very disappointed
After much prayer, however, we picked up the burden to fill the city of Taipei with the preaching of the gospel
There were many slogans, such as, 'Jesus is the Savior,' 'Jesus loves you,' 'Jesus saves,' and 'God so loved the world'
The brothers endeavored to take care of every section by filling the mail boxes with tracts and by putting the tracts on every door
In Matthew 12:29 the Lord Jesus clearly said that if the strong man were not bound, no one could plunder his house
In 1980 the Living Stream Ministry published Gospel Outlines, containing two hundred sixty-six outlines for gospel messages
The Apostle Paul had a great deal to speak because the Old Testament was a rich source of light and truth to him
We should put them on our breast and shoulders , bearing them in love and in power into the presence of the Lord
We are priests, so we can pray for the sinners to bring them to God, and we are kings so we can bring God to the sinners
It would be good if each church could set aside at least one evening a week to come together to pray and learn the truth in the Word
Eventually we found that this list of verses was inadequate to meet all the needs of the people we contacted in our gospel preaching
Sometimes we needed an understanding of chapters and even of whole books of the Bible for our preaching to be effective
Before he was put into prison, Paul rented a house for the purpose of preaching and speaking the word to people
If you preach a gospel message in a cathedral, it will not be as attractive as the same message preached in your home
Once a young person graduates from high school, he usually begins to think about the goal and meaning of his life
A person may have the financial ability to rent or purchase a house but not have the ability to afford food and refreshments
One brother may make an offering so that snacks can be served to the seeking young ones that come to another brother's house
We do not need any gimmicks, but we must have two basic things-prayer and the word-with the additional help of our homes
We must follow the early apostles and disciples by taking the way of prayer, the word, and the homes for the preaching of the gospel
In the previous two chapters, we have seen some crucial matters relating to the preaching of the gospel on the campuses
In chapter two we saw the importance of prayer and the Word in our gospel preaching with the additional help of our homes
For our gospel preaching we need not only the words spoken out of our mouth, but also a life that shines before men
It is a shame to the Lord to His name and to His gospel when Christians preach the gospel while their living is not according to the gospel
We must have the highest daily life to match our preaching, but this does not mean that we should have strict, legal standards of conduct
When the pastor found out, he went to the brother's house and admonished the brother not to wear the narrow-brimmed hat
We should not have legal standards in the church life regarding the length of a brother's hair and the length of a sister's skirt
While little babies do not have any knowledge of outward regulations, they still have the human nature that regulates what they eat
Verse 4 says that through God's precious and exceedingly great promises, we 'become partakers of the divine nature'
In the Lord's recovery, we do not need any outward regulations concerning the style of our clothes or the length of our hair
When the young people go to the campus to preach the gospel, the Christ you bear witness to depends upon the life you live
When you partake of the divine nature and are inwardly regulated you will gain fruit not only by your words but also by your life and living
In Philippians 1:27, Paul charged the saints in Philippi to conduct themselves worthily of the gospel of Christ
If the Lord never touches our conscience through prayer, we are not praying in the Holy of Holies in His presence
If we pray to the Lord in the Holy of Holies, in His holy presence, He will touch whatever we are and whatever we do
We should open every part of our being to the Lord in prayer so that He can touch us through His inward regulation
Because the early apostles were solid converts in the Lord's salvation, their gospel preaching produced solid, remaining fruit
If the young people are told to have their hair the same length, that would be only an outward form of legality
When the young people go to the campuses to preach the gospel, they need not only a proper daily living but also a universal love
They may even say that our beliefs are a form of superstition, but deep within many of them appreciate our love toward the Lord
Idolatry, which includes the enjoyment and love for sinful things, brings people into fornication and lowers their standard of morality
The love in human society is often a deceiving love, but the love among the saints is real, genuine, convincing, and attractive
In 2 Peter there is a progression from the divine nature to brotherly love and eventually to the divine love, a love that is toward all men
All of the early disciples were surprised, and many of them did not believe that Saul of Tarsus had turned to the Lord
After his son, daughter-in-law, and daughter sent him many letters and telegrams asking him to attend a meeting, he finally came
In 1943 he turned this way and Brother Nee eventually appointed him to be one of the elders in the church in Hong Kong
For the sake of the truth, we should be strong, but we should also love everyone, even the top opposers and evil persecutors
We need a universal love, loving the Lord Jesus, loving all the saints, and loving all people, including the opposers
