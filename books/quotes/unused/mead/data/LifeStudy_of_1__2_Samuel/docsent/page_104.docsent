   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Declaring to David</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That He Would Make Him a House</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jehovah declared to David that He would make him a house v. 11b . When we love the Lord, we may feel that we should do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, when we resolve to do something for the Lord, we may have the sense deep within us that we need the Lord to do more for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we will see, we are short of Christ and we need more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God Raising Up David's Seed</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Referring to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and Establishing His Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Referring to Christ's Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God said to David, "I will raise up your seed after you, which will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom" v. 12 . Here "your seed" refers to Christ and "his kingdom" refers to Christ's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His response to David's desire to build God a house, God in a sense came in to stop David by indicating that before David could do something for God, he needed God to do something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we would think to do something for God, God within us would tell us that we are short of something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our shortage is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this point I would ask you to consider some lines from a hymn that speaks of how much we need Christ Hymns, #1024 :</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You need Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You need Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Men and women all need Him!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For redemption you need Him,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For salvation you need Him!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And for everlasting life,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yes, you need Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need more and more of Jesus; we can never get enough of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are short of Christ, God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need God to make His Son our seed; that is, we need Christ as our heritage and our treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a sinner turns to God and believes in Christ, he may then have the heart to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, to such a person God would say, "Do you intend to do something for Me?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have a great need for Me to do something for you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What I want to do for you is to constitute My Son into your being to be your treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless I do this for you, you will never have the capacity to do anything for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Christ whom God desires to constitute into us is not only our treasure He is also our home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where do we live today?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before Christ the Son of God was wrought into our being, we were homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be homeless is to be Christless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without Christ, we do not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, without Christ we do not have righteousness, justification, or satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need God to build Christ into our being to be our righteousness, justification, food and drink, clothing, satisfaction, dwelling place, and home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order for this to happen, God has put us into Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , and now Christ is becoming everything to us.</S>
