BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>After we are saved, we have the Lord&rsquo;s life. From that time onward, our relationship with the Lord is altogether a matter of union in spirit. Hence, we should not neglect the spirit by relying merely on messages. We should use our spirit to listen to a message, and we should use our spirit to digest the message that we understand with our mind. When giving a message, the speaker&rsquo;s words should open the listeners&rsquo; mind and understanding so that the Spirit, through the spoken words, can pass through the listeners&rsquo; mind and enter into their spirit. This must be the goal of giving a message. The words spoken in a message serve as an opener, a forerunner, and a lead into the spirit. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit&rdquo; (John 6:63). In this verse the Lord&rsquo;s words are a guide and herald of the Spirit. Although the Lord speaks the words, they become spirit and life to us when they pass through our understanding and enter into our spirit. Hence, if we desire to contact the Lord and be joined to Him, we cannot rely merely on our mind to understand His words. We must allow the words to open our mind and enter into our spirit through our mind. Next, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s words with our spirit. Once the Lord&rsquo;s words enter into our spirit, they become the Spirit, and as soon as the words become the Spirit, they are life to us. When this is our experience, the words that the Lord speaks are Spirit and life to us.</p>
<p>Why does the Lord, who is the Spirit, have to enter into us through His words? The Spirit becomes words because human beings have a mind, and everything that is not physical enters into us through our mind and thoughts. Without passing through our mind and thoughts, nothing spiritual can enter into us. In order for the Lord who is the Spirit to enter into us, He must pass through our mind. To this end, as the Spirit, He becomes words that can open our mind and our understanding. Once our mind and our understanding are opened, that is, once the gate to our person is opened, the Lord&rsquo;s words can enter into our inner chamber, our spirit. As soon as these words enter into our spirit, they become the Spirit. Once these words become the Spirit, they are life to us. Hence, we should not be satisfied with the young people merely listening to a message. The message must open their understanding, change their concept, and leave a clear impression in their thoughts. This will open the gate to their spirit so that the words that they receive in their spirit will become the Spirit and be life to them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS BEING THE SON&rsquo;S, AND<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT RECEIVING ALL THAT THE SON<br />
HAS AND DECLARING IT TO THE DISCIPLES</h2>
<p>At this point we need to consider John 16:15, which is important, even though it is not easy to understand. In this verse, the Lord said, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He [the Holy Spirit] receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; This verse often is neglected and put aside. It states that the Holy Spirit receives all that the Lord Jesus has and discloses it to us. In this short verse, there are four main points. First, <em>all that the Father has</em> refers to <em>all the fullness of the Godhead</em> in Colossians 2:9. Second, <em>is Mine</em> refers to <em>in Him dwells</em> in Colossians 2:9. <em>All that the Father has is Mine</em> means that all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ. Third, in reference to the Holy Spirit <em>He receives of Mine</em> means that the Spirit receives all that the Son has. Hence, according to John 16:15, all that the Father has is given to the Son, and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit. We also can say all that is of the Father is in the Son, and all that is of the Son is in the Spirit. In order to have a complete understanding of verse 15, we must look at some preceding verses. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&rdquo; In verse 7 the Lord Jesus told His disciples, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter [the Holy Spirit] will not come to you.&rdquo; This means that if the Comforter does not come, all the reality that is in the Son will not be able to enter into the disciples. All that is of the Father can only be in the Son, but all that is of the Son cannot enter into the disciples unless the Holy Spirit, as the Comforter, comes. In order for all that is of the Father to not only be in the Son but also to reach the disciples, the Holy Spirit must come, because He receives all that the Son has. Fourth, <em>will declare it to you</em> in verse 15 corresponds to <em>guide you into</em> in verse 13. All that is of the Father is in the Son, all that is of the Son is received by the Spirit, and all that the Spirit receives is declared to us and revealed in us by the Spirit&rsquo;s guiding us into all the reality.</p>
<p>We must clearly tell the young people that they must touch the Spirit if they desire to touch God and gain Christ practically. We need to touch the Spirit because all that is of the Father is given to the Son, and all that is of the Son is received by the Spirit. Without knowing and touching the Spirit, we cannot touch anything of the Son. This is the reason we say that we need to use more than our mind when we listen to a message. We must let the words open our mind, pass through our mind, and enter into our spirit to become the Spirit. All that the Son has, which is all that the Father has, is in the Spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
