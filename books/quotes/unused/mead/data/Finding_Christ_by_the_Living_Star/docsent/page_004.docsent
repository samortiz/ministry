   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOTHER WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They saw Christ and they worshipped Him; then we read in the Bible some significant words they were warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, so they departed into their own country "another way."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I like this term "another way."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After you have seen the living Christ, you will always take another way; you will never go the same way as you came.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact, you should have come this way in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You came the wrong way; now the Lord has adjusted you so that you will go on by the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Don't go back through Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Forget about Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Don't go back to religion take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By your former way you can never meet Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But, hallelujah, there is another way!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Los Angeles there is another way!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In San Francisco there is another way!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the United States there is another way!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have not seen Christ, go back to religion, go back to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if you have seen Christ, be warned you must take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PHILIP AND NATHANAEL</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Based upon the same principle, let us look at the case of Nathanael in John 1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Philip found Jesus and came to Nathanael and said, "Oh, I have found Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have found the one of whom Moses and the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may say that Philip gave the right information, and you may also say that it was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Philip called Him the "son of Joseph" is this right?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you say that Jesus is the son of Joseph, I will say that He is absolutely not the son of Joseph He was born of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if you say He is not the son of Joseph, I will say that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank the Lord for Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Philip was really good and so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He just answered, "Come and see!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, "I don't know if I gave you the right information or not just come and see!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I don't know what to say, I don't know what is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just come and see!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nathanael was a godly person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He asked, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a sense, Nathanael was right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He learned from the Bible that Christ should not come out of Nazareth, but from Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May the Lord allow me to use a word which is not inherently good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God told His people in His holy writings that Christ would be born in Bethlehem; so all His people received this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God did something in a "sneaky" way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ was conceived not in Bethlehem, but in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And during Mary's pregnancy He was brought to Bethlehem just for a short time, not in an ordinary way, but in a very extraordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God sovereignly worked: He used Caesar Augustus of the Roman Empire to issue an order for a census, forcing Mary and Joseph to travel to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Immediately upon arriving in Bethlehem, Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But just a short time later, He was brought away from Bethlehem to Egypt, and then from Egypt to settle and grow in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So you see, Jesus really fulfilled the Scripture by being born in Bethlehem, but we may say that it was in a "sneaky" way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you just knew the letter of the Word, you would miss it altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has a way of circumventing clever people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus was truly born in Bethlehem, but He was also Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not simply trust in the letter of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you do, you will miss something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You need the Word, but you still need God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There not only was the prophecy in the Old Testament, but also the sovereignty of God, and the sovereignty of God in a sense is rather "sneaky."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is not so open, so public, so greatly advertised.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The little child Jesus just "sneaked" in. If you are so legal, so scripturally legal, God in your case is rather "sneaky." You must be on the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You should not say, "I know the Bible; the Bible says such and such."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do, you will be fooled by your knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The scribes knew the Scriptures backwards and forwards, but it profited them nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need to be in the presence of God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not despise the Scriptures; I honor and respect them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But be careful, the Scripture is the Scripture, but it is not God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Scripture is God's holy writings, but you still need God's holy presence.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we have His presence, we will really know when He is in Bethlehem, when He goes away, when He comes back, and where He is raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to follow the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What the Lord has been doing through history, towards the worldly and religious people, is always hidden and "sneaky."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is really difficult to explain it to people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you ask who Jesus is, outwardly speaking, He is just a man; He is Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is really so.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no glory, no boast, no display.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Philip really gave Nathanael the best answer: "Come and see!"</S>
