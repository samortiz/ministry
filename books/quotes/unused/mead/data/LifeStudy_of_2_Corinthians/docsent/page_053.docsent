   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY COMPETENT OF CHRIST AS THE ALPHABET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO WRITE LIVING LETTERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE LIVING GOD 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3-6</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 3:3 Paul says, Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here Paul speaks of a letter of Christ ministered by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a letter is written, inscribed, with the Spirit of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All those who are co-workers and leading ones in the churches must look to the Lord for His mercy and grace in order to carry on the work of writing Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of merely teaching doctrines to others or only teaching the Bible, we must do the unique work of writing living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>CHRIST IN OUR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would inscribe Christ into others, we must first have Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not have Christ in an experiential way, then with what shall we write a letter of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We shall, of course, have nothing with which to write.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we try to do any writing, it will be like trying to type with a typewriter that has a dry ribbon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day I was typing and discovered that nothing was on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then I learned that the ribbon was completely dry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was no ink on the ribbon to transfer the letters to the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I use this to illustrate the fact that in order to write a living letter of Christ, we must first have the experience of Christ ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>HEAVENLY INK</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Living letters of Christ are written with the life-giving Spirit of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The life-giving Spirit is the heavenly ink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would have this kind of ink, we need to experience Christ and be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we must be thoroughly saturated with the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are persons full of Christ, saturated with the life-giving Spirit, we shall have the riches of Christ to use in writing Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We shall also have the life-giving Spirit of the living God as the heavenly ink.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The ink is the Spirit, the essence of the ink is Christ, and we are the pen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any kind of ink must have a particular essence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ink is different from plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not possible to write a letter using only water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There must be a certain substance added to the water to make ink.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise the Lord, the heavenly ink is the Spirit, and the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others should always find us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Philippians 3:9 Paul speaks of being found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He wanted to be found by others in Christ, not in anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul did not want to be found in himself, in his culture, or in his particular way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also should aspire to be found in Christ, to be one with Christ, saturated with Christ, and even constituted of Christ and reorganized with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, being anointed with the Spirit and filled with the life-giving Spirit, we shall have the Spirit as the ink to write Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then as we speak to others, we shall spontaneously write upon them with the life-giving Spirit of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The element of the riches of Christ will be infused into them, imparted into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, Christ will be inscribed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To write Christ into others in this way is truly to live Christ for the church.</S>
