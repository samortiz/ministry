[2]  CHAPTER ONE BEING APT TO TEACH AND HOLDING THE MYSTERY TWO ASPECTS OF SPIRITUAL LEARNING
[3]  First Timothy 3:2 says that overseers must be "without reproach" and "apt to teach," and verse 9 says that deacons must hold "the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."
[4]  Then 2 Corinthians 4:1-2 says, "Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart; not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God."
[5]  The Supply of Spiritual Reality Being Dependent on Our Learning and Experience in Our Daily Life
[6]  Without learning we will not have anything stored up within us, and without anything stored up within us, our inner content will not be rich.
[7]  Holding the Mystery Understanding the Truth Taking the Scriptures as the Basis and Principle in Everything
[8]  Furthermore, everyone who has a heart to learn to serve must understand the divine truths.
[9]  While reading the Scriptures, he must enter into the spiritual reality of the Scriptures and allow the Holy Spirit to enlighten him before God so that he may see the mystery of the faith.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO HOW TO DISCUSS THE MATTERS OF THE CHURCH
[11]  When we encounter a difficult matter in our service in the church, how should we discuss it and make a decision concerning it?
[12]  Sometimes in the meetings of the elders and co-workers, the majority of those in the meeting may not say anything, as if they have no opinions.
[13]  "Therefore it is my opinion" Speaking according to One's Observation of God's Work in the Church
[14]  Acts 15 also shows us how we should speak.
[15]  A FEW POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP FOR THE ELDERS AND DEACONS WHO ARE NEW IN THE COORDINATION Being Responsible and Accurate in Speech
[16]  First, you must learn to speak accurately among the children of God.
[17]  CHAPTER THREE HOW TO LEAD THE NEWLY SAVED ONES THE NEWLY SAVED ONES NEEDING TO ADVANCE IN THREE MATTERS
[18]  A newly saved one should steadily advance in three matters.
[19]  Needing to Use the Scriptures in Helping People Become Clear about Their Salvation
[20]  We have to learn to be able to use the words of the Bible in helping people, especially those who have been listening to messages for years and are still not clear about their salvation.
[21]  Helping Them to Know that Dealing with the Conscience Is for Them to Walk the Path before Them
[22]  In order to advance, a Christian must have a conscience without leaks.
[23]  Next, we need to help the newly saved ones to be rooted in the reading of the Word.
[24]  For these ones we need to have a systematic, section by section reading of the Word of God, studying it as if we were studying a science.
[25]  For about two thousand years there have been various disputes in the church concerning the qualifications for believing in the Lord and being saved.
[26]  RECEIVING PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE Believing and Being Baptized
[27]  When we receive people by baptizing them, we must do it not according to the practices in traditional Christianity but according to the Bible.
[28]  There is a story of a person who had been a preacher for many years.
[29]  All of us who have had the experience of salvation and have been brought through it by God know what it is to be saved, to repent and turn to God, to contact the Lord, and to have the presence of the Lord.
[30]  Because we often do not see people's inward condition, we may receive someone who has the doctrinal understanding but does not have the Lord in him, or we may reject someone who has the Lord within but is confused concerning doctrine.
[31]  The service of the Body in the church is a matter of coordination and a matter of authority.
[32]  In serving, one may have the deep experience of feeling isolated.
[33]  We all know that in the service of the Body the first thing is coordination, and the second thing is authority.
[34]  If we have been dealt with properly before the Lord and have properly learned our position, we will know who is before us as our authority and who is behind us the ones to whom we are the authority.
[35]  CHAPTER SIX A FEW QUESTIONS CONCERNING REVELATION AND RELIGION SERVING ACCORDING TO REVELATION
[36]  Suppose a person already has the concept of serving God before he is saved.
[37]  While preaching the gospel, if we speak about escaping the vanity of life, yet we ourselves have not had the experience of escaping the vanity of life, is this not also being religious?
[38]  In John 3 Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus in the night and said, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher" v. 2 . Yet the Lord Jesus said to him, "Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" v. 3 . Nicodemus said in surprise, "How can a man be born when he is old?" v. 4 . The Lord Jesus said, "So must the Son of Man be lifted up" v. 14 . It is no wonder that on the day the Lord Jesus was crucified, Nicodemus came to the Lord while all the disciples fled.
[39]  Originally man lived before God in the garden of Eden and had a face to face relationship with God.
[40]  If we want to live out Christ in our Christian living, we need to have fellowship with the Lord.
[41]  In the same way, the more we draw near to God, love God, and consider God, the more we will spontaneously have a sense of affection toward God.
[42]  THE ALTAR REMOVING THE BARRIER BETWEEN MAN AND GOD, ENABLING MAN TO COME NEAR TO GOD AGAIN
[43]  In the Old Testament we can see a picture of man's fellowship with God.
[44]  THOSE WHO COME TO THE ALTAR BEING THE HELPLESS ONES
[45]  The sparrow and the swallow are not only small but also without a definite dwelling place and safeguard.
[46]  In chapter one of the Song of Songs the Lord tells those who follow Him not to forget to pasture their young goats by the shepherds' tents v. 8b . This also corresponds to Psalm 84, which says that not only do we ourselves find rest at the altar, but we can also "lay our young" there for the multiplication of our spiritual life.
