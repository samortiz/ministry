   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Anything Not Initiated by the Holy Spirit Is Not the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Shanghai many people can establish an evangelistic mission, seminary, Bible institute, or Bible study class.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a mistake is minor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But no one can establish a church!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are not able to obey the Holy Spirit, and man's authority and man's things come in, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If it is not started by the Holy Spirit, it is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not know whether we have seen the seriousness of this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is possible for a few of us to establish a factory; this is comparatively easy to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Allow me to say that we are men who have the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people in the world who do not have the leading of the Holy Spirit can open a factory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the church cannot be started like this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regardless of whether we are a believer or an unbeliever, whether we have the life of God or not, we cannot establish a church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If it is not started by the Holy Spirit, it is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is quite a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one can start a church, because in the first place, no one has the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is no authority of the Holy Spirit, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regardless of the situation, we cannot establish a church if the Holy Spirit does not start it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, we must ask, "What about the start?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Holy Spirit is not the initiator, we cannot start anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must submit ourselves to the mighty power of the Holy Spirit and put ourselves under the authority which operates according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be wholly restrained and not seek our own freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must let the authority of the Holy Spirit pass through all of us freely.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Boundary of Locality</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to the above, a church has to have a second ground.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the second element, there also is no ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will probably ask: Is it not enough to express and live under the authority of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this not enough to establish the church?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No, it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible clearly shows us two things which must exist in order to establish the church: first, the authority of the Holy Spirit, and second, the boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not see this, we do not understand the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Does this seem strange?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Does this seem like falling ten thousand feet from heaven to earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yes, but remember that the church is also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is part heavenly and part earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The heavenly part concerns the authority of the Holy Spirit; the earthly part concerns the boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a very wonderful matter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible clearly shows us this one thing: The church absolutely belongs to a locality, such as the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , which is a place; the church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 , which is a place; the church in Antioch Acts 13:1 , which is a city; and the church in Ephesus Rev 2:1 , which is a seaport.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Bible the ground of the church is the locality where the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The churches all take locality as the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here is a special point; please pay attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the brothers and sisters in Shanghai desire to stand on the church ground, they can only stand on the ground of the Holy Spirit and the ground of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They must stand on the ground of the Holy Spirit and also on the ground of Shanghai because Shanghai is the locality in which they live.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once we disregard locality, we immediately lose the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let me give a few illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Church and the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts 9:31 speaks of the churches in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church spoken of here is plural in Greek, English, and Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the churches in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is plural in number because at that time Judea was a province of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since a province included many localities, there were many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the Bible does not speak of the church in Judea, but the churches in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Scriptures there is only a local church, not a provincial church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The same is true of Galatia, which was a province consisting of many localities; therefore, Galatians 1:2 says, "The churches of Galatia."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesus is a seaport, a locality; therefore, the church in Ephesus is referred to in the singular.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This point is very clear in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Philadelphia was a city, and only one church existed there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Asia, which is Asia Minor today, was a large province; therefore, the Bible says, "The seven churches which are in Asia," not the church which is in Asia Rev 1:4 .</S>
