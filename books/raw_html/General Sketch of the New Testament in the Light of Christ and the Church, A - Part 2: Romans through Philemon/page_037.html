<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>WALKING BY THE SPIRIT IN GALATIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gal. 3:16, 29; 5:16-17, 22, 25</h1><p>In the order and the arrangement of the books of the New Testament, there is the sovereignty of the Lord. It is appropriate to have 1 and 2 Corinthians follow Romans. The two Epistles to the Corinthians show us that the Christian walk and the church life are a matter not of gifts or knowledge but of Christ being wrought into us by the working of the cross. They deal with gifts and knowledge on the negative side and with the living Christ working within us through His cross on the positive side. This is the central thought of these two books. Then following 1 and 2 Corinthians, we have Galatians. This is the right order.<h2 class=head1>THE PROBLEM OF THE LAW AND JUDAISM</h2><p>In the realm of religion, the law is a prevailing problem. For thousands of years of human civilization, there has never been anything as prevailing and prominent as the law given to man. Among the human race, many philosophies and ethical systems have been invented. According to the human thought, not only philosophy and ethics but also certain religions formed among people are helpful to some extent. The most outstanding item in this realm is the law given to man by God. This is a significant matter. Among all the races in human civilization, the law given by God is the greatest item. It is greater than all the other human elements. It is greater, better, and higher than all philosophies and teachings of ethics and all forms of religion on the earth.<p>Based upon the law given by God, the Jewish religion was formed. Judaism is the highest and the most genuine religion. However, Christ has now come, and the church has come into existence. Now in the universe, particularly on this earth, there is the universal man. How can the law given by God with the Jewish religion based on this law coexist with Christ and the church? How can we have the law with its religion together with this universal man? Are these two contradictory to one another, or can these two be reconciled? This was the first and greatest problem that the church faced. Immediately after the birth of the church, the church faced its biggest problem, the law and its religion. Judaism and the law were the biggest deterring factors to the building up of the church. Therefore, after Paul’s two Epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians deals with this matter of the law. We need to be very impressed with the matter of the law. We must understand where the law stands in relation to God’s economy. We must know what kind of position God has given the law and what the function and purpose of the law are.<h2 class=head1>THE POSITION OF THE LAW</h2><p>The Jewish people believe that besides God nothing is as great as the law. Only God Himself is higher and greater than the law. In their understanding they give all the ground to the law; it is second only to God Himself. Now we ourselves must deal with the problem of the law. In our understanding and according to God’s revelation, what is the position assigned by God to the law?
