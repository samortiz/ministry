[2]  The events of world history have been sovereignly arranged by God for Him to carry out His purpose.
[3]  As Acts 17:26 says, He "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation."
[4]  Whether we speak of His becoming flesh through the incarnation, or of the spread of the gospel, or of the raising up of the church life, or of the preparation of the bride, all these aspects of His move require the proper environment, as far as the world situation is concerned.
[5]  We trust that these messages will make the reader more aware of God's arrangement of world affairs, more concerned about the crucial time in which we live, and more burdened for His ultimate move in what might be the ultimate world situation.
[6]  We like to tell You how much we love You.
[7]  In You we see God, we find God, and we obtain God.
[8]  For these great things to be accomplished, there had to be the right situation.
[9]  In the Old Testament there was the prophecy which hinted that the Lord Jesus would hang on a tree Deut 21:22-23; Gal 3:13 .
[10]  After I was saved I was interested in studying world history and comparing it with the Bible so that I might know more concerning the spiritual things.
[11]  What God uses, Satan also comes along to use in order to cause damage.
[12]  With the coming of the Reformation the Bible was released.
[13]  This, coupled with the free thinking that developed once Catholicism's hold on the mind was broken, led Christians to the discovery of many new truths in the Bible.
[14]  There was still the need for the gospel to be spread to Africa and to Asia.
[15]  There was also the need for the spread of the light seen by the Brethren to every part of the earth.
[16]  CHAPTER TWO THE WORLD SITUATION IN RELATION TO GOD'S MOVE ON EARTH 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 17:26-27; 1:8 THE PRESERVATION OF AMERICA
[17]  I love Britain, but how pitiful she is today!
[18]  We must live Christ, be filled with Him, and have Him as our daily living and as the practical, actual contents of the church life that we may be His living Body to express Him.
[19]  Just a few years before Christ was born, the Roman Empire became fully established.
[20]  When Britain saw that Russia had gained ports in the Far East, she influenced Japan to fight Russia.
[21]  This agreed with Japanese interests, since Japan wanted the areas of China that Russia was controlling.
[22]  The situation in the Middle East is also under God's sovereignty.
[23]  It is for us to live Christ, to have Christ as our living, to have Christ as the reality, the real contents of the church life, making every local church a golden lampstand.
[24]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD'S ULTIMATE MOVE TO CARRY OUT HIS ETERNAL INTENTION Scripture Reading: Matt 28:18-19; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47; John 15:16a; Acts 1:8; Rev 1:2, 12, 20; 19:7
[25]  What is God's ultimate move to carry out His intention?
[26]  God wants us to have Christ as life to us, flowing in us, saturating and permeating us, transforming us, conforming us, and making us fit to be built up into His Body for His expression.
[27]  Today, at the end of the Twentieth Century, this is what our God is after.
[28]  He wants Christ as the embodiment of God to become your life, and you as a member of Christ to become a part of His Body.
[29]  Even if our gospel preaching is adequate, our Bible teaching accurate, and our meetings scriptural, we still need to ask ourselves: Do we have the ultimate move of God among us?
[30]  The continent of North America was created by God along with all the other continents.
[31]  Then it was found by a new people, many of whom were God-loving and Bible-loving.
[32]  After the four Gospels, there is the fifth book, Acts.
[33]  Acts 1:8 says, "Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me.
[34]  When He was about thirty, He came out among the people.
[35]  He was like a great magnet, drawing others after Him.
[36]  Colossians 1:25-27 says, "Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
[37]  If you ask Christians about Christ making His home in their hearts or about the church as His Body being the fullness of Him who fills all in all, many will wonder what you are talking about.
[38]  The Bible clearly tells us what God's ultimate move is.
[39]  God's ultimate move is to have Christ as the mystery of God enter into us as our life.
[40]  Then we become His living members and together form His Body, which is the very fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[41]  We do not understand this in an adequate way, but this is what is in the Bible.
[42]  This is Paul's completing ministry, telling us that Christ is God's mystery and Christ has become our life; that we are the church, which is Christ's mystery Eph 3:4-6 ; that the church is the Body.
[43]  No other writer of the Bible besides Paul tells us that the church is the Body of Christ.
[44]  Even before his death, a decline had set in. Different teachings came in. Thus Paul wrote in 1 Timothy about holding the mystery of the faith 3:9 . What is the mystery? "Great is the mystery of godliness, Who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory" 3:16 . This was Paul's declaration to bring the degraded Christians back to his completing ministry.
[45]  He also said that we may eat Him as the living bread John 6:51 and live because of Him v. 57 . In his Epistles he tells us repeatedly that God dwells in us 1 John 3:24b; 4:13, 15, 16 .
[46]  Such preaching will be largely limited to these points: Christ is the Son of God; He became a man, lived on this earth, then died on the cross for our sins; He was buried, then arose from the dead, and is now on the throne; He is our Redeemer and Savior, soon to return to take us to heaven; by believing in Him we have forgiveness of sins and are children of God; while we are on this earth, we have to improve our behavior that our lives may glorify God.
[47]  They had no hymn saying that Jesus, after resurrection, became a life-giving Spirit to live in me to be my life that I might be His member and all of us might be His Body, the church, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
[48]  I hope some hymns could be written, saying that Christ is now the life-giving Spirit, even the seven Spirits, in me to make me His living member; this I know because the Bible tells me so!
[49]  That is, He wants to recover Christ, the mystery of God, becoming the indwelling Spirit to infuse, impart, the Triune God into the tripartite man, thus making us who believe in Him members of His Body for His expression.
[50]  What the Lord is going to recover is simply this: Christ as the mystery of God to live in us as the indwelling Spirit, making us His members that we may become the church, the mystery of Christ, as the Body to express Him.
[51]  Then you will see that all the Life-studies are on the same subject: the two great mysteries, the mystery of God Christ and the mystery of Christ the church .
[52]  The Lord raised up Great Britain and used her for more than two centuries to spread the gospel and the spiritual teachings.
[53]  No historian has said this, but my answer is that God arranged this so that America would be preserved for His ultimate recovery.
[54]  CHAPTER SIX GOD'S ULTIMATE RECOVERY AND THE WORLD'S ULTIMATE SITUATION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1, 2, 11-18, 20; 2:7; 3:12; 4:5; 5:6; 19:7-8; 22:1-2, 14, 17 THE IMPORTANCE OF PAUL'S WRITINGS
[55]  God's ultimate move was fully revealed through one apostle, Paul.
[56]  He was the one who received the stewardship to complete the word of God Col 1:25-27 , that is, to complete the revelation of God's move.
[57]  This Spirit is the consummate expression and reaching to man of the Triune God, that He may constitute His chosen people both the sons of God with the divine life and nature and also the members of Christ organically united to Him, so that God may have a family and Christ may have a Body to express Him corporately.
[58]  The Bible was completed by the end of the first century.
[59]  Revelation opens with "the revelation of Jesus Christ" 1:1 .
[60]  Revelation is not only an objective term; it has a subjective aspect as well.
[61]  In Colossians Paul revealed a Christ who is everything He is all-inclusive; He is all-extensive; He is the portion of the saints; He is the image of God; He is the first item of all the creatures; He is the Firstborn of resurrection; He is the reality of all the shadows!
[62]  Recently some of the leading ones asked me how the churches should go on.
[63]  I told them frankly that to ask for a way to go on is to ask for more religion.
[64]  If Brother Lawrence's Practice of the Presence of God is merely a way, it is a religion.
[65]  When I came to this country in 1958, there were some who were predicting the downfall of the United States.
[66]  They said that the United States was following the pattern of the Roman Empire, becoming corrupt and bankrupt.
[67]  CHAPTER SEVEN OUR ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY Scripture Reading: John 15:5, 16a; Acts 1:8; 1 Cor 2:1-2; 6:17; Phil 1:20-21a; Eph 4:4a; Col 3:10-11; Rev 1:2, 11, 12; 19:7, 8 GOD'S HAND IN WORLD AFFAIRS
[68]  Now we have to realize our responsibility related to these three things.
[69]  My burden is not to talk about politics but to show you that since God has a purpose to accomplish on this earth with mankind, He surely has the sovereign authority and power to arrange the situations in human history.
[70]  From the spiritual heavenly point of view, human history has seven stages, with the present stage being the last, that is, before the millennium.
[71]  Just a few days ago I came across an old book by A. T. Pierson.
[72]  At the end of the last century he visited Philadelphia and, while there, gave a series of messages which he called The New Acts of the Apostles.
[73]  This is a good title, reminding us that the book of Acts does not really have only twenty-eight chapters.
[74]  In this book Pierson says that God kept a continent veiled for five thousand years, rending the veil only when a reformed church with an unchained Bible was ready to enter it.
[75]  Our responsibility is to live Christ, to bear a living witness to Him in our daily life, to know nothing but Christ, the all-inclusive One revealed in the completing ministry of Paul and the mending ministry of John.
