   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What does it mean to stand?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It means to wait for a command, to wait upon the Lord to speak His will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Countless numbers of works have been set up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am not speaking of the work in factories and offices.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christians ought to be absolutely faithful to their earthly masters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to be very faithful in serving our earthly masters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when it comes to spiritual work, we need to be more than just efficient.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I speak in particular to all the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers, is your work fully set?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is your work carried out efficiently?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can you not stand still and wait for awhile?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Has much of your work been arranged and listed in order?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do you methodically work according to the list?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Are you complete in everything?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers, can you wait for another three days?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Can you stand still for a moment and not move around?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to stand before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone who does not know how to draw near to the Lord will surely not be able to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Similarly, everyone who does not know how to stand before the Lord will surely not be able to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible for them to minister to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers, should not a servant wait for an order before he does anything?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let me reiterate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since this is a spiritual matter, I am not afraid of repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are only two types of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One is rebellion against His command.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He gives an order and you refuse to do it, it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there is another type of sin, which is doing something without the Lord's command.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One is the sin of rebellion, and the other is the sin of presumption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One ignores what the Lord has said; the other does what the Lord has not said.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Standing before the Lord is the way to deal with the sin of doing what the Lord has not commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, how much of your spiritual work is done only after you are clear about God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How many really work as a result of the Lord's charge?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps you work out of your zeal or because you consider it a good thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me tell you that nothing damages God's will more than good things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Good things hinder God the most.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can easily recognize that as Christians we should not take part in evil, unclean, and lustful things and that these things are intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, it is unlikely for these things to be a hindrance to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The things that hinder God's purpose are the good things, the things that are similar to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may think that such a thing is not bad or that there is nothing better, and we may do it without asking if it is the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Good things are God's greatest enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Indeed, every time we rebel against God, it is because we presume that something is good, and we go ahead and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As children of God, we all know that we cannot sin and that we should not do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But how often have we done something just because there was no conviction from the conscience or because the conscience thought it is all right to do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No doubt, such a thing may be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But have we stood before the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to stand before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Standing means to not walk or move; it means to remain in a place, to stand still and wait for the Lord's order.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brothers, this is the ministry to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The killing of cattle and sheep in the outer court is done whenever someone comes to offer a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in the Holy of Holies, there is utter solitude and no man in sight.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Holy of Holies, no brother or sister has any authority over us, neither will a conference make decisions for us, nor does a committee have the authority to commission us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Holy of Holies, there is only one authority that will govern us, and that is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will only do what the Lord directs us to do; otherwise, we will not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers, can we really stand before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we want to minister to the Lord in the Holy of Holies, we must spend time before the Lord and pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, we will be inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to pray to be ushered into God's presence and to draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, to pray is to stand before God; it is to seek His will before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank the Lord that although every believer does not do this, some are standing before the Lord and following Him in the journey ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to stand before the Lord, it is necessary "to offer unto me the fat and the blood" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>44:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We know that God is holy and righteous in the Holy Place and that God is glorious in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's glory fills the Holy of Holies; God's holiness and righteousness fill the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The blood is for God's holiness and righteousness, while the fat is for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The fat is for God to gain something, while the blood deals with God's holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We all know that God is holy and righteous and that He absolutely cannot accept anyone sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without the shedding of blood or the remission of sin, without man paying a price for his sin, God will never be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, there is the need for the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no way to approach God without it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Old Testament time, man was put aside and could not come forward to God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But we can come before God because we have the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Not only so, but we also have to offer the fat, which means to offer the richest and best.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We know that the blood deals with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the fat is for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The fat is the richest and best part, and it satisfies God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, it is for God's glory.</S>
