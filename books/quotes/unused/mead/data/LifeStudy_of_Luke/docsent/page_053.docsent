   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Faith Coming before Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this case we need to pay attention to the three matters of faith, love, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When as a young Christian I read this chapter, I thought that the woman s love for the Savior was the cause of the forgiveness of her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I thought that He forgave her because she loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This understanding is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 50 the Lord said to the woman that her faith, not her love, had saved her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, regarding the two debtors who were forgiven by the moneylender, the Lord asked, Which of them therefore will love him more? v. 42 . This indicates clearly that love is the issue of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning this, we need to pay attention to the word therefore in verse 42.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word proves that love comes after forgiveness instead of preceding it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What, then, is the cause of the forgiveness of sins?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From verse 50 we see that the cause is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was the woman s faith that saved her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Her sins were forgiven not because of her love but because of her faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, faith comes before forgiveness, and love follows faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love Coming out of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very important for us to see that forgiveness comes before love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not think that our love is the cause of the forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, love is the issue, the outcome, of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we believe in the Lord, our faith becomes the cause of the Lord s forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then as a result of having our sins forgiven, we begin to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, love comes out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Love Issuing in Peace</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Love issues in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First we believe in the Lord Jesus, having faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we are forgiven of all our sins, and this brings in love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we love Him, this love issues in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We, then, may walk in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To walk in peace means to live in peace, to have a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we walk in peace, we have our being in peace and live a peaceful life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that when we believe in the Lord, we love Him and live a life in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 7:36-50 we see faith, love, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have faith in the Lord, we have love toward Him, and we have peace in following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we have believed in Him, we have been forgiven of our sins, and now we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This love issues in a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As those who love the Lord, we live, walk, and have our being in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AN ATMOSPHERE OF AFFECTION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The atmosphere in 7:36-50 is an atmosphere of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is affection both on the side of the Man-Savior and on the side of the sinful woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s affection is an aspect of His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once again in His human virtues we can see His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In particular, we see the attribute of divine authority to forgive a person s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to verse 49, those who were reclining at the table with the Lord said among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This One is the very God, for He alone has the authority to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Man-Savior s divine attributes are also shown in His giving peace to the forgiven sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only God can give peace to a forgiven sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are you able to give peace to others?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not in our hand to give others peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peace is in the almighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only He can forgive sins and give peace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the forgiving of sins and the giving of peace are two attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here these attributes are expressed in the Savior s human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 7:36-50 we see once again that the Man-Savior saves people in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the emphasis in the Gospel of Luke, the highest standard of morality is a matter of the human virtues of the Man-Savior expressing His divine attributes.</S>
