Instead, we should be filled in our spirit. Our spirit needs to be filled with the processed Triune God, with the transcending Christ, with the consummated Spirit. Then we will be full of praise, singing and speaking one to another (vv. 19-20). The melodies, the songs, are not only good for singing but also good for speaking. As we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, as we are praising God, we will spontaneously be submissive to one another (v. 21). The wives will be submissive to the husbands, and the husbands will love the wives (vv. 22, 25). Then we will have the proper church life, full of submission and full of praising to the Triune God, with no quarreling, no murmuring, and no complaining.</P><P>Ephesians 6 tells us something further. On the one hand, the church life is a praising life and a submitting life; at the same time it is also a fighting life. While we are praising and submitting to one another, the enemy is here fighting, so we have to fight against him by prayer. Verse 18 says that whenever we pray, we should pray in our spirit, not in our mind. If we are going to walk, we need to use our feet. No one can walk by his nose. Even for someone to walk on his hands is awkward. To walk by our feet is the right way. In the same way, we should not pray merely by our mind. We must pray by our spirit and in our spirit.</P><P>Our spirit mingled with the Spirit has been mentioned six times in the book of Ephesians. This indicates that to know God's economy, to receive His dispensing, and to participate in Christ's transmission, we must know, we must use, and we must exercise our spirit. We should not be persons in our mind but persons in our spirit.</P><P>We may be exercising our spirit to worship the Lord at His table, but afterward we may immediately turn to our mind. The wife may begin to think about how badly her husband treated her the previous evening. Then her emotion gets stirred up and her will makes a decision to threaten him. This is the result of her not exercising her spirit. She should not think about her husband. Instead, she should praise the Lord in the spirit and pray in the spirit. If we do this, we will be victorious. When we exercise our mind in an independent way, we are defeated. When we turn back to our spirit, we become the victor.</P><P>We should not consider or talk about the things of the church life by our mind. If we exercise our mind to consider and speak of the church life, we will say that the elders are not that good. We will also say that the old saints and the young people are not good and that the children are naughty. Eventually, to our mind nothing is good in the church life. Even when we are praying, a negative thought may come into our mind that a certain brother is not so good. Quite often in our good prayer, we are stopped by just one thought. Right away we have to shout, "Praise the Lord! Jesus is Victor!" We need to chase away the enemy in our mind and continue to pray. Sometimes we may have to rise up from our knees and say, "Satan, get away! Praise the Lord! Lord, You are the Victor!"</P><P>If we have any problem concerning the church, we must exercise our spirit to pray. Then we will have the vision to see and the wisdom to understand. Then we will understand why there is the need of the onefold transmission to follow the threefold dispensing of the Divine Trinity. We will see that this transmission is by the One who transcended from Hades through the earth, through the air, and through the third heaven to become higher than the heavens.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
