   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 NON-SECTARIANISM.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Christians think they know better than to say, "I am of Cephas," or "I am of Paul," or "I am of Apollos."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They say, "I am of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such Christians despise the others as sectarian, and on that ground start another community.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their attitude is "You are sectarian; I am non-sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are hero worshippers; we worship the Lord alone."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God's Word condemns not only those who say, "I am of Cephas," "I am of Paul," or "I am of Apollos."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It just as definitely and just as clearly denounces those who say, "I am of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not wrong to consider oneself as belonging only to Christ; it is right and even essential.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nor is it wrong to repudiate all schism among the children of God; it is highly commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not condemn this class of Christians for either of these two things; He condemns them for the very sin they condemn in others their sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a protest against division among the children of God, many believers seek to divide those who do not divide from those who do, and never dream that they themselves are divisive!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their ground of division may be more plausible than that of others who divide on the ground of doctrinal differences, or personal preference for certain leaders, but the fact remains that they are dividing the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even while they repudiate schism elsewhere, they are schismatic themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you say, "I am of Christ," do you mean to say others are not?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is perfectly legitimate for you to say, "I am of Christ," if your remark merely implies to whom you belong; but if it implies, "I am not sectarian; I stand quite differently from you sectarians," then it is making a difference between you and other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The very thought of distinguishing between the children of God has its springs in the carnal nature of man, and is sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we look on other believers as sectarian and consider ourselves to be non-sectarian, we are immediately differentiating between God's people and thereby manifesting a divisive spirit even in the very act of condemning division.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter by what means we distinguish between the members of God's family even if it be on the pretext of Christ Himself we are guilty of schism in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What then is right?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All exclusiveness is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All inclusiveness of true children of God is right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Denominations are not scriptural, and we ought to have no part in them, but if we adopt an attitude of criticism and think, "They are denominational; I am undenominational.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They belong to sects; I belong to Christ alone" such differentiating is definitely sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, praise God I am of Christ, but my fellowship is not merely with those who say, "I am of Christ," but with all who are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is of vital importance is not the confession, but the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although these other believers say they are of Paul, of Cephas, and of Apollos, yet in fact they are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not so much mind what they say, but I very much mind what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not inquire whether they are denominational or undenominational, sectarian or unsectarian; I only inquire, "Are they of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they are of Christ, then they are my brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our personal standing should be undenominational, but the basis of our fellowship is not undenominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We ourselves should be non-sectarian, but we dare not insist on non-sectarianism as a condition of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our only ground of fellowship is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our fellowship must be with all the believers in a locality, not merely with all the unsectarian believers in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may make denominational differences, but we must not make undenominational requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We dare not differentiate between ourselves and them, because they differentiate between themselves and others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are the children of God, and because they make distinctions between themselves and other children of God, they do not on that account cease to be the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their denominationalism or sectarianism will mean that severe limitations are imposed upon the Lord as to His purpose and mind for them, and this will mean that they will never go beyond a certain measure of spiritual growth and fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Blessing there may be, but fullness of divine purpose never.</S>
