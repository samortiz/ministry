   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What should our attitude be as Christians towards all these problems?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the midst of all these debates and arguments, where should Christians stand?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we have to see that God has already prepared the solution to all these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has also set the schedule for the fulfillment of the solution.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is very clear about these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can see from the Bible that no one is as clear as God towards these issues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason you need not fret, worry, or hastily propose your own suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Christ came the first time, He saved us individually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not deal with the world or its systems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not touch any social problems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His first coming was to settle the spiritual issues, not the material ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this does not mean that He ignores the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ will take up these problems; He will deal with each in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But our work and responsibility as Christians are only to concentrate on that which God concentrates.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We only do what Christ is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is our basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ALL PROBLEMS ORIGINATE FROM SIN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No doubt we see many problems existing in our society and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every one of them is a major issue.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every one demands an immediate solution.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we have to see that the one factor that originates all these problems is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these problems arose because man became fallen and alienated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The order in which God works out His salvation is first to save us and solve our problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After man is saved, all the problems related to him are consequently solved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TAKE CARE OF GOD'S CONCERN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the redeemed ones must first of all know God's work and concentrate on His concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What concerns God most is the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also must concern ourselves with the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since God cares for personal salvation and sanctification, we have no choice but to pay attention to the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The solution to these problems is the work of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It ought to be the work of every one who belongs to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today Christ is dispensing God's life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also have to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is His work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is also our work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because God's ordained work for the Christian today is saving sinners from sins and dispensing God's life, regardless of our rank and file, we have to do the work of saving men from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether we are kings or slaves, our commission is the same: to dispense God's life to others.</S>
