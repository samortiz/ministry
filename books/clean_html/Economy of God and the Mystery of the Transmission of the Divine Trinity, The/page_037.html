<h2 class=head1>ALL THAT THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT HAVE BEING TRANSMITTED TO US BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>After receiving all that the Son has, the Spirit comes to “declare” it to us. this means that He comes to transmit it to us. What does the Spirit do when He comes? He transmits to us all that He has received from the Son. This means that all that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit have are all conveyed and transmitted into us by the Spirit.<p>Our Christian living is often like a car that does not start. This is because we have not received enough transmission of the Spirit. Our “battery” is frequently in a low condition, so our engine does not start. Often when we want to pray, we lack the energy because we do not have the Spirit as the motivating power in us. At such a time we need the transmission of the Spirit; we need the Spirit to be transmitted into our spirit and to fill us.<p>In John 16:15 we have “Father,” “I,” “He,” and “you.” “Father” is the Father, “I” refers to the Son, “He” refers to the Spirit, and “you” refers to us. Therefore, in this verse four persons are mentioned: the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and us. The riches in the Father are transmitted into the Son; then all that is in the Son is transmitted into the Spirit of reality; finally when the Spirit of reality comes, He transmits into us all that He has obtained and all that He possesses.<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are mysterious yet very simple. In contrast, human beings are very complicated. The Lord Jesus was God, yet He became a man—a complicated man. Do not think that we are simple. in fact, it seems that the more spiritual we are, the more complicated we become. If you love the world and commit sin, this is very simple, because there is nothing but darkness in you, and you are totally in darkness and are earthly. But once you believe in the Lord Jesus, it seems you become quite “unclear.” You do not know whether you are in heaven, on the earth, or in the air. Even you yourself cannot clearly describe your situation. Sometimes you feel that you are full of the Holy Spirit and full of life, and other times you feel that you are heavenly and uplifted. Most of the time, however, you feel that you are so muddled and entirely earthly. The reason we are so complicated is that we are earthly people by nature, but we also have the Spirit within us. Once the Spirit comes into us, He brings the heavens to us; the Spirit and the heavens are very close. However, if there is not enough transmission of the Spirit within us, then we are far away from the heavens and close to the earth.<p>Thus, you see that there is a wonderful transmitting, a wonderful conveying, in this universe. You may say that it is “the transmitting of the Spirit,” “the transmitting of the Lord,” “the transmitting of God,” or “the transmitting of the heavens.” In short, it is simply the transmitting of the Triune God into us. Consequently, we become people who are of the Spirit, who are of the Lord, who are of God, and who are of the heavens. This is the spiritual significance of the “transmission.”
