The Roman Catholic Church says that all believers in the world are under her regardless of the country in which they live. The state church, such as the Anglican Church, claims that every citizen of that nation belongs to the church. Due to the dissatisfaction with the state churches, there are also the private churches. As far as the outward appearance, or boundary, is concerned, if someone claims to be a Christian, we cannot cast him out of the kingdom of the heavens, because the Lord has not permitted the collecting of the tares today. However, in the bread breaking meeting, the church may have an unsaved person or an evil person removed (1 Cor. 5:2, 11-13). Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance may include unsaved ones, just as the state churches do. However, for the church meetings, it is permissible not to receive an unsaved person. This shows that the kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance and the church are two completely different spheres. There may be tares in the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, but there cannot be any unsaved person in the church. Those who are not saved cannot enter into the church.</P><P>The parables in this chapter may be divided into several sections: (1) The parable of the sower is the introduction. (2) The parable of the wheat and the tares is in contrast with the parable of the good species and the foul species. Just as there are good wheat and bad tares, there are also good species and foul species. (3) The parable of the mustard seed is in contrast with the parable of the leaven. The mustard seed is outward, whereas the leaven is inward. (4) The parable of the treasure is in contrast with the parable of the pearl. The treasure refers to the outward, whereas the pearl refers to the inward. To show contrast is not to repeat; it is for emphasis, because one refers to the church and the other refers to the Gentiles. (5) If the word concerning the new and old treasure is also considered a parable, it is in contrast with the first parable, the parable of the sower.</P><P>Verse 3:"And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow." In this parable the Lord did not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...," because the work of sowing the seed was done by the Lord Himself. The kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance or sphere did not begin until the Lord was rejected and the disciples began to work. This parable speaks specifically of the result of the work of the Lord Jesus on the earth, which is a matter before "the kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...." If we want to be strict in our interpretation, we must interpret it in this way.</P><P>In verses 24-25 a "man" and "men" are mentioned. The man refers to the Son of Man; the men refer to the Lord's servants. The sowing was done by the Son of Man alone; no one else had any part in it. How many kinds of seeds are there? There is only one kind. This means that all the seeds are the same. But what about the earth? There are four kinds. The seeds refer to the word of the kingdom of the heavens, the earth refers to the heart of man, and the sower is Jesus Christ.</P><P>"Went out to sow." If this is not the beginning of a new dispensation, then it must be the preparation for a new dispensation. In the Old Testament God planted Israel as a vine (Jer. 2:21). The vine is planted in the vineyard, and the roots of the vine constantly absorb the moisture from the earth. Therefore, the vine typifies God's earthly people. When the children of Israel went to Canaan, the first evidence of what the good land was like was the grapes from the Valley of Eshcol (Num. 13:24). The blessings of the Israelites are always on the earth. To sow the seed is to sow wheat. After the season is over it is reaped when it has dried. This refers to Christians.</P><P>Although the Old Testament mentions the fig tree, it does not use the fig tree to represent the children of Israel. Rather, it uses the vine to represent the children of Israel. However, the New Testament uses the fig tree to represent the children of Israel (Matt. 24:32). In Luke 13 a fig tree was planted in a vineyard. Because the children of Israel were not good, God put them aside from their chosen position. The fig tree had not produced fruit for three years, but it was to be kept to see if it would produce fruit in that year. Therefore, the vine is a permanent representation of Israel, whereas the fig tree is a temporary representation of Israel. Here in Matthew 13 what is presented is the sowing of seed; it is neither the permanent representation nor the temporary representation.</P><P>What does "beside the way" refer to? (1) The "way" is land that has never been tilled, and it has the most traffic. That is, it is a place that has not been dealt with by God or sown by men. This is the place where the evil spirits dwell. The field signifies the world, so the place "beside the way" must be the air. (2) The place "beside the way" is not the way itself; it is close to the way. This shows that it is a place that is especially close to the demons. It is probably very corrupt in morality.</P><P>"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes... This is the one sown beside the way" (v. 19). A person's rejection of the Lord is due to the unwillingness of his heart. This is just Satan blinding the eyes of man's heart to keep the glory of Christ from shining in (2 Cor. 4:4). In Matthew 5-7 the Lord presented the word of the kingdom of the heavens in a way that cannot be any more clear. But the people were not able to receive it. It does not say that they did not believe, but that they did not understand. This word was spoken especially to the Jews. The Jews do not believe because they do not understand. This corresponds to the word spoken in verses 13 through 15 concerning not being able to understand. Therefore, the Lord said that they are neighbors to the evil spirits. People of this kind are not saved.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
