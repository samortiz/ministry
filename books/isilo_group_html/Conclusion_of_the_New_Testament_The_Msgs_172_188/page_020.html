The word for &#8220;expedient&#8221; means profitable (not merely convenient), advantageous, good, worthwhile. This Greek word means profitable, economical, convenient, helpful in reaching the goal quickly. It also refers to things that are good. Here Paul&#8217;s thought may be that all things are lawful but not all things help us to remain in the central lane of God&#8217;s economy. All things are lawful, but not all things help us in bearing the cross or are profitable in experiencing Christ.<p>If we would understand Paul&#8217;s use of the word expedient here, we need to have a proper realization concerning the book of 1 Corinthians as a whole. All things are lawful to us, but not all things help us to gain the profit revealed in this Epistle. Not all things help us to live the Body life. Yes, you may be free to do certain things, but those things will not help you in the church life, and they will not strengthen your prayer life. If we apply what Paul says in 6:12a according to the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians, we shall see that Paul&#8217;s word here is all-inclusive. Paul is saying that all things are lawful to us, but not all things are good, profitable, convenient, or economical for us to live the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life.<h2 class=head5>(b) Concerning Themselves, All Things Are Lawful to Them, but They Will Not Be Brought under the Power of Anything</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 6:12b Paul says, &#8220;All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.&#8221; In verse 12 Paul twice says, &#8220;All things are lawful to me.&#8221; The first use of these words is somewhat objective; the second use is very subjective.<p>Literally the Greek words rendered &#8220;be brought under the power of&#8221; mean to be brought under the authority of. All things are under my power, but I will not be brought under the power (authority) of anything. All things are permissible, allowable, lawful, to me, but I will not be ruled (enslaved) or brought under the authority, the control, of any.<p>When we consider whether or not to do a certain thing, we should ask if we are under the power or control of that thing. If a particular thing controls us or has power over us, we should not do it. For example, we may wonder if we should eat certain foods. It may be all right to eat those foods, but they should not have any power over us. We must fully deal with anything that has power over us.<h2 class=head5>(c) Concerning Others, All Things Are Lawful but Not All Things Build Up</h2><p>First Corinthians 10:23b says, &#8220;All things are lawful, but not all things build up.&#8221; The parallel verse, 6:12, ends with not being under the power of anything. This verse ends with not building up. The former concerns ourselves; the latter concerns others. In 6:12 Paul&#8217;s concern is personal, but in 10:23 it is corporate. In 10:23 the words &#8220;build up&#8221; refer not only to the edification of individual believers but also to the building up of the corporate Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:4-5, 12; Eph. 4:16). First Corinthians emphasizes the matter of building up (3:9-10, 12; 8:1).<p>In all that we do we must take care of things, ourselves, and others. Concerning things, everything we do must be a profit. Concerning ourselves, everything we do should not be a bondage, a slavery, to us. Concerning others, anything we do must build up others.<h2 class=head5>(d) Concerning God, Whatever They Do, They Do All to the Glory of God</h2><p>First Corinthians 10:31 says, &#8220;Whether therefore you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.&#8221; Glory is the expression of God, God expressed in splendor. Whatever we do must be to the glory of God, that is, to God&#8217;s expression. This means that, in particular, we need to glorify God in our body (1 Cor. 6:20b). To glorify God in our body is to let God who dwells in us (1 John 4:13) occupy and saturate our body and express Himself through our body as His temple, especially in the two matters of eating and marriage, according to the context of 1 Corinthians from 6:13 through 11:1. For this, we need to exercise a severe and strict control over our body, bringing it into subjection (9:27) and presenting it to God as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1).<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:12 and 10:23 and 31 we have four basic principles for regulating the conduct of the New Testament believers. First, all things are lawful to the believers, but all the things they do must be expedient. This means that the things must be profitable, that is, not causing the suffering of any loss. Second, the believers must not be brought under the power, the control, the authority, of anything. Third, all things the believers do must build up others. Fourth, whatever the believers do, they must do to the glory of God. Otherwise, nothing is permissible or acceptable. If a certain matter does not pass the test of these four principles, we should not do it.<p>As believers in Christ, we are free, for we are not under law. Nevertheless we still need to be regulated by the four governing principles. Concerning any particular matter, we need to consider if that thing is profitable, if it has power over us, if it builds up others, and if it glorifies God. In practice, we may find it very difficult to live according to these principles. This is why we need the dispensing of the processed Triune God. To live according to these principles is to take the narrow way that leads to life (Matt. 7:14). In order to walk this narrow way we need Christ. Therefore, we need to learn to take Christ and apply Him to every situation. Because it is difficult for us to be released from our habits, we need the Triune God, and we need His dispensing.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 172-188) &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
