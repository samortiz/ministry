   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, And the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, Paul says that the Lord is the Spirit; on the other hand, he speaks of the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the context, the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 refers to Christ the Lord 2 Cor 2:12, 14-15, 17; 3:3-4, 14, 16; 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This, then, is a strong word in the Bible telling us that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The expression the Spirit of the Lord is used both in 2 Corinthians 3:17 and in Acts 8:39.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the entire context of the book of Acts, the Spirit of the Lord refers to Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true in 2 Corinthians 3:17, where the Spirit of the Lord refers to the Lord as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in the same verse Paul says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul goes on to say, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The expression the Lord Spirit again proves that the Lord Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord, He is called the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Gospel of Mark we see Jesus, and in the book of Acts we have the Spirit of the Lord and the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in 1 Corinthians 15:45 Paul speaks of Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be sure, the last Adam is Jesus, the very Jesus presented in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul says that this last Adam has become a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He became the life-giving Spirit through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say that the Spirit of Jesus is the transfiguration of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus was the seed that passed through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In resurrection He, the last Adam, blossomed and became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we may say that the life- giving Spirit is the blossoming of the Lord as the seed that passed through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us use a carnation seed as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both the seed and the blossom are a carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The difference is that the seed is the carnation in seed form, whereas the blossom is the carnation in blossom form.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a similar way, we may say that the seed in Mark is Jesus, and the blossom in Acts is the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today do we participate in the Lord as the seed or the blossom?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The correct answer to this question is that we experience Him as both the seed and the blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We enjoy Him as the seed who has become the blossom in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Romans 8:2 Paul speaks of the Spirit of life, and in Romans 8:9, of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of Christ is related to the Lord s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the One who passed through death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now that we have this Spirit in us, we have not only Christ, but Christ in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s death was an all-inclusive termination, and His resurrection was an all-inclusive germination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His death we were terminated, and in His resurrection we were germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord that we have the all-inclusive Christ with the all-inclusive termination and germination!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of Christ, therefore, is the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we have this Spirit as the blossom of Christ, we have the all-inclusive Christ and His all-inclusive termination and germination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As those who have been terminated and germinated, we are now in this wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we have received the wonderful Spirit of Christ, we should praise Him and not merely pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us praise Him because we already have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we only pray but do not praise, in our experience we may be like the disciples in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In a sense, James and John prayed when they asked the Lord that He would grant them to sit at His right and left in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We today are not in Mark 10 nor even in Mark 16 we are in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since we are in Romans 8, we should not tell the Lord in prayer how miserable we are or how pitiful our condition is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead of asking the Lord to help us with our problems, we should praise Him that we are in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this Spirit we have life, strength, power, ability, might, and authority.</S>
