   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO DISTRIBUTE TRACTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After realizing the importance of tract distribution, we have to consider the methods of passing out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ordinary Ways</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most common way to pass out tracts is by ordinary day-to-day sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In passing out tracts this way, we have to note the following points.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, the tracts must be powerful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They must have words that clinch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tracts that are effective in saving souls should be used again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Tracts that are ineffective should be discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Tracts that are effective should be reprinted again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In passing out tracts on the streets, we should not break local laws.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, we should pray for God's blessing before setting out so that every tract will carry saving grace with it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Third, when we pass out tracts, we have to pay attention to our attire and expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our dress has to be proper; it must match our status.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should neither be too modern nor too modest; our clothes must be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, we have to be very polite.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are reaching middle-class people, we should dress like a middle-class person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fourth, in passing out tracts, we should be sincere and sober in our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not be flippant or light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not act like the street hawkers, and do not behave rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In giving out a tract, hold it out with your left hand, bow or nod at others, and then present it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If they accept it, give them another acknowledging bow or nod.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a person refuses a tract, we should not become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he throws it away, we can pick it up again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he turns around and reviles us, we should not argue with him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can do the following: 1 let him go; 2 send him away politely; 3 try to convince him with a few words; or 4 pick up the tract again and pray for the tract.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If possible, the church should pray often for the work of tract distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pray that the Lord would give us more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to get more fruit, we have to persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to pray 1 that God would bless those who receive the tracts; 2 that God would not allow the tracts to be destroyed; 3 that God would allow the tracts to be passed along; 4 that God would save everyone whose hand has touched the tract; and 5 that God would extend the days of the tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Special Ways</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second way to pass out tracts is more special.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ordinary way is non-systematic; this distribution is done anywhere and everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Special distribution is distribution according to a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can group our people by teams and distribute tracts door to door along each street.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to carry out this way of distribution, we must first divide ourselves into teams.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can put two brothers in a team or two sisters in a team.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can assign a street or highway to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the team assignment, we can tell them to give one tract to each household.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Next we pray for the tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should seek for an opening word with which to speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should also seek to know how long we should wait before visiting the same neighborhood again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Tract distributors should commit themselves to go out once every other day or once every three days or four days.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At least they should go out once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the assigned time, they should divide up the tracts according to the questions the tracts address and distribute them to each person according to need.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Finally, they have to pray for blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In passing out tracts, there are a few things to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, we should find the name of each household from the telephone book.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should write the name of each household on an envelope and send out the tracts in the envelope.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second, we should deliver tracts to some people in person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Third, in mailing tracts, we should write the names and addresses legibly and drop the mail in the mailbox.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In passing out tracts, others may ask what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can tell them that we are delivering the glorious gospel of the Son of God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some methods have been used in other parts of the world with great success.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times entire households have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fourth, we can take a street or a district as a unit and ask some brothers and sisters to be responsible for distribution along that street or in that district.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is also a very good way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Personal Distribution</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Another way of distribution is the personal way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The personal way targets our relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes it is hard to preach the gospel to our relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But it is easier to give them a tract.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to be careful in choosing the tracts we give.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must consider the condition of every case.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can show some people how sin has damaged them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can show others how money and vainglory cannot satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to pray for them and bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In presenting tracts to them, we have to be serious and polite.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to say, "There are many things which I cannot say, and there are many things which I myself do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But I would like to give this tract to you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please read it."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After returning home, we should pray for them and ask God to bless them and to make the tract fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this way, it will be easy for us to spread the gospel to our friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>OTHER MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are faithful in carrying out this burden, we will soon find that our tracts are very inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although some tracts are small, they are very effective in saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These tracts should be reprinted again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our tracts should not be for looks only.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They have to have words that catch men.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These are the useful words.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The language and content of the tract have to be clear and direct; there must not be any misspelled words.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If there is a misspelled word in a tract, it may lose its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In writing tracts, we have to be very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No one can be careless in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In preaching the gospel, we have to learn to speak the right words to the right people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In distributing tracts, we have to do the same, giving the right people the right kind of tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>For example, if you give a worldly person a tract about the vanity of the world, his chance of getting saved will be great.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some people have had contact with the church already; a tract explaining the depth of the Lord's grace may be very effective in bringing about their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>One becomes conscious of sin only after he has believed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we talk to an uninterested person about sin, we may offend him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The most direct approach to ordinary worldly people is to speak to them about the vanity of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This will easily bring them to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must carry tracts in our pocket all the time, like carrying our business cards.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As soon as we meet a person, we should give him a tract.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Sometimes it is hard to open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>A tract can take the place of our speaking, and others will not feel too much imposition.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Some people like to ramble about scurrilous things as soon as they sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A tract will shut their mouths and even give us a chance to open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we present a tract to them, we can say a few words or we can say nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we practice this faithfully, the Lord will save many people.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Finally, we have to remember that while we are the ones who are passing out the tracts, we cannot depend on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We should not think that we can save anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have to trust in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Whenever we pass out a tract, we have to pray that the Lord will bless the receiver of the tract.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have to ask God's Spirit to save men through these tracts.</S>
