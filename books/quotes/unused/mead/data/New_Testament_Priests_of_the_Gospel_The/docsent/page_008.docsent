   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preaching the Gospel Everyone Ought to Go</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 28:19 says.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Go ye therefore.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ye here does not refer only to the little company of disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It does not refer only to the hundred and twenty who prayed that day at Pentecost in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it refers to all those who believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All believers past and present are included in this ye.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We who are the disciples of the Lord should all go out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only then will this match the nature of the Body that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What God is after is not an individual gospel giant but a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the preaching of the gospel must be done by every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is like my walking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I walk, not only do my feet walk; my legs, shoulders, head, and even my whole body walks as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot find any place in the entire New Testament that the Lord charges only a minority of believers to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What we see is that the Lord commands all the believers when He says that All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations Matt 28:18-19a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All authority has been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, when our gospel teams go out to speak to others, they have to be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They should not be afraid of heaven or earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should be afraid of no one for the Lord Jesus has given us all authority in heaven and on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, every one of us can preach.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter who we see, we can tell them boldly, Repent, and believe in Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the organic functioning and the organic move.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gospel preaching in Christianity is not an organic move.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, it is an organizational movement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Pastors are hired to come and preach while all the other believers rest and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is organization.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we are the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the brothers should go and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the sisters should also go and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone should go and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do this, this will match the nature of the content of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let me say again that the content of the New Testament has nothing to do with a congregation, a denomination, or an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What God is after is a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the matter of preaching the gospel, all the members of the Body of Christ with no exception should preach and should move.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Meeting in Homes and Groups</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone Should Participate</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only should everyone preach the gospel, they should all participate in home meetings and group meetings as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the elders know that, on the one hand, they wish that there could be as many people as possible in their church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the other hand, they are afraid that there would be too many people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because the more people there are, the more problems there are, and often it becomes impossible to take care of all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Formerly we used to set up leaders to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These leaders then became another kind of pastor and preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This way does not match the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now every one of us is a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, if a small group has fifteen people, all fifteen come to speak and to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While others are speaking, I am learning, and while I am speaking, others are learning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there are some mature ones in the small group, there is all the more reason for everyone to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, it will not be only one that is teaching; instead, everyone will teach.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what is meant by everyone participating in the home and group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If five hundred people are baptized today, immediately we should have five hundred brothers and sisters come forward to claim one baby each.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although they may not be begotten through you, yet when you claim them for your own, it is as if you had begotten them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After being nourished for six months, these new ones become stabilized.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will then lead them to the small group meetings so that they will get acquainted with those in the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way, gradually they will also know how to care for people and help people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When they see you praying and caring for people and meeting their need, they will learn to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is like a big family where the younger brothers and sisters learn to do what the older brothers and sisters do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we establish a model in the group meeting, the newly baptized ones will find many lessons to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is to have all the members function together.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A small group where all the members function together becomes a body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever the church moves, all the members act together in coordination as one body.</S>
