   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Crucified to Accomplish</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the All-inclusive Death for Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus was crucified in order to accomplish the all-inclusive death for redemption John 1:29; 1 Cor 15:3b; Heb 2:14b; John 3:14; 12:31-33; Gal 6:14; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20a; 5:24; John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus died an all-inclusive death, and His death dealt with six main negative items: sin including sins John 1:29; 1 Cor 15:3b , Satan Heb 2:14b; John 3:14 , the world John 12:31-33; Gal 6:14 , the old man Rom 6:6 , the flesh Gal 5:24 , and the "I" Gal 2:20a , which includes our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, the Lord's all-inclusive death accomplished one positive thing: it released the divine life from within His humanity John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the Lord's death was at least sevenfold in its accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus' all-inclusive death became a strong factor in His consummated triune Being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through such a death, He obtained an eternal redemption for His redeemed people Heb 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being Resurrected to Bring Humanity into Divinity,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Making the Believers of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sons of God and Members of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After He passed through death, the Triune God entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In resurrection, He brought humanity into divinity, making the believers of Christ sons of God and members of Christ 1 Pet 1:3; John 1:12; Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To bring humanity into divinity is to bring man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The incarnation of the Triune God brought God into man, and His resurrection brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through this kind of traffic, a wonderful mingling takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now, in His resurrection, God is mingled with man and man is mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, man and God, God and man, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this mingling, God made the believers of Christ sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These sons of God are human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God can say to His believers, "I am divine and human," and His believers can reply, "Praise You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are divine and human, and we are human and divine."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was accomplished through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we live in resurrection, we bring humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that when we live in resurrection, we bring ourselves into God, and when we do not live in resurrection, we are outside of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, resurrection is still going on today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 6:4-5 says that we were buried through baptism into death and were raised to walk in newness of life v. 4 , which is the likeness of Christ's resurrection v. 5 . As we are living in resurrection, we are one with God and are being brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being Consummated to Be the Compound,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All-inclusive, Indwelling Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the steps of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God has been consummated to be the compound, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit Exo 30:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Exodus 30, an ointment was prepared, and this ointment was called a compound ointment because it was made from oil compounded with four different spices vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This compound ointment is a type of the compound Spirit, who is the Triune God compounded with humanity, the all-inclusive death of Christ, the all-powerful resurrection of Christ, and the transcending ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This compound Spirit is the consummated Triune God.</S>
