   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO PROPHESY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wording of this verse is very emphatic, stressing the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is indicated by the phrase "but rather that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the word rather means especially.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul encouraged the saints to pursue love and to earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but he especially encouraged them to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The stress here is altogether on the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 14:31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words learn and be encouraged are placed together in this verse to show that learning leads to encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to prophesy we must first learn ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"That all may learn" refers to the hearers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the hearers should learn what the speaker says, the speaker also must learn a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prophesying requires much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we have learned something, we are able to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then through our prophesying, others will learn from us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To prophesy according to 1 Corinthians 14:31 is not something which comes down upon a person suddenly in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That kind of experience does not require any learning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prophesying requires learning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to help the saints to learn how to prophesy, we published the books entitled The Holy Word for Morning Revival.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In these books only a few verses are given for each day, and we encourage the saints to digest these verses through reading and pray-reading them again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have provided some space within these books for writing down the inspiration one receives each morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After six mornings, one may have six inspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then these six inspirations can be used to compose a prophecy to speak in the church meeting on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a very good way to learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today in the churches, we are still learning how to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One thing which I practice to enrich my prophesying is to read diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My riches come from my diligent reading.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the past sixty-six years, I have been diligently reading the Bible and the best writings concerning the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The notes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study messages can help us to enter into the divine revelation in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Learning to prophesy requires our labor on the Word with the help of the proper exposition that opens up the Word.</S>
