   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This became a prophecy in typology.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather he said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave" v. 38 . Eventually, due to the severity of the famine, Jacob was forced to send his youngest son with his brothers to Egypt to buy grain 42:4, 36; 43:1-15 . What a suffering this was to Jacob!</S>
