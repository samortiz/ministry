   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE SPIRIT BEING DIFFERENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE MIND AND THE EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brothers and sisters, it is a fact that we have a spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our spirit is different from our mind, our emotion, and our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible does not tell us to walk according to the heart; instead, it tells us to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to follow the spirit, to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I often tell people that today you may love a person but in the future you may hate him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those whom you hate are usually those whom you have loved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without marriage there cannot be divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why is it that love can turn into hate?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is because this love was from the emotion, or at most it was only from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The heart is so unreliable; it changes faster than the weather in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, all the wives need to know that none of the husbands is trustworthy, and all the husbands need to know that none of the wives is truly gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She might be gentle in this hour, but in the next hour she will strongly lose her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This proves that the human heart is not trustworthy; it is capricious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But, praise the Lord, there is one thing that is constant, and that is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you love someone with your spirit, your love will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not he loves in return or if he is good or bad, you will still love him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>RETURNING TO OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TO GET OUT OF THE REALM OF SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our spirit was created uniquely and especially for us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would like to tell you something that we know from our experience, though it is not explicitly mentioned in the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fact is that because man fell, his spirit is now influenced by his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, it seems that God has drawn a line and said to Satan, Don t go beyond this point.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is as though God said, You can enter into man s body and usurp man s soul, but you cannot enter into man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His spirit is off limits to you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, whenever you return to your spirit, you get out of Satan s realm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you remain in your mind instead of returning to your spirit, you will enter the kingdom of Satan and be under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we must learn to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of what people say to you, your mind should not dwell on what they say; regardless of how much people are angry with you and try to provoke you, you still must return to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah, as long as you remain in your spirit, Satan cannot do anything to you!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, when you remain in your spirit, you are in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you contact the Lord in this way, He will flow more abundantly into you to be your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way you can eat and enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TWO WAYS OF READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we will consider the matter of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know that there are two ways to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first way is to read with our mind; this is the common way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we read with the mind, the more deadened we become.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we read like this, the drier and emptier we are and the more depressed we become.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then what is the right way to read the Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is by the second way, which is to read with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After reading a sentence, you call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By calling on the Lord while reading, you receive all the words of the Scriptures into you as life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord said, It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we cannot receive the word with our mind; we must contact the word with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word is spirit, and we touch the word by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we pray with our spirit and read the word with our spirit, we absorb and receive the Lord abundantly into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the time of our believing, the Lord regenerated our spirit, changing our old spirit into a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From that time onward the Spirit of the Lord has been remaining in our spirit; that is, the two spirits have now become one spirit and witness together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today this spirit in us is a mingled spirit, a wonderful spirit, and a rich spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You simply need to learn to turn to your spirit and to exercise your spirit moment by moment; then spontaneously you will touch the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result, you will enjoy the riches of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have a spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Exercise your spirit!</S>
