   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SPREADING Meeting the Need in Every Place</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After this visit I feel that the situation of Christians in the West is disappointing, that their questions and their situation confirm that the way we know and are taking is the right way, and that the urgent need in every place is God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In light of this situation, I ask whether we should limit what God has entrusted, measured, to us to the island of Taiwan?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Or will God enlarge our borders because of our growth in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to spread, but how should we spread?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What are the borders for our spread?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Should we be limited to the Far East, or should we spread also to the West?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In terms of needs, every place has needs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The brothers in Tokyo have repeatedly asked for some workers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They requested that I present their need to the brothers here and ask that some workers be sent to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The brothers from Bangkok sent me a letter in which they asked us to send more than two workers to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was there, they said that if I cannot go there, I have to send some workers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is also a need in America.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The saints there requested that we send several brothers to them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The question that we must ask is whether we should spread abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Should we limit ourselves to the Far East, or should we go to the West?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what I want to fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am also willing to hear your feeling concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to spend time in the Lord s presence to see how we feel about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not Being Limited by</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What We Have Learned and Are Doing</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>but Having a Feeling for the Body</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I also have a feeling about the overall situation in Taiwan and the situation of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord in His mercy has used the brothers and sisters in every place to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, several factors limit our usefulness in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One factor is that our spiritual view is narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are two aspects to our narrowness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are limited by what we have learned, and we are limited by what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The help we can render others is only according to what we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot go beyond this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are also limited by what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This also narrows our view.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are useful, but we are limited in our work by these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not have a feeling for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our work must not be limited by what we have learned or by what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our work is to build up the Body of Christ, which has a local aspect and a universal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not merely helping individual believers to be spiritual or helping a group of believers to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, our work is for the churches in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the same time, we are building up the Lord s universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord grant us another opportunity to fellowship further concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Lord s work we should not be limited by what we can do or by what we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must have the view and the measure of the local and universal aspects of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, Hudson Taylor was not a gospel preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was a person who learned to abide in the Lord because of what he saw in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, he received a burden to evangelize the whole of China.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While China was still under the Ching Dynasty, Hudson Taylor said that he would use the Lord s gospel to evangelize imperial China.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His burden testified that his work was not limited by what he had learned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The burden that he received was beyond what he had learned and experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the reason that he was blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every believer who is limited by what he has learned is under the influence of the mystics, who were not productive in relation to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The evangelicals were raised up to make up the lack of the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord must enlarge us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not be ambitious to be great; we must remain humble.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must also allow the Lord to enlarge us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This will affect whether our work will spread.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Other Reasons for Our Work Being Restricted</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some workers are useful but restricted by what they have learned and by what they are doing because they are not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The work in some places is restricted, or even suffers loss, because we are not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Another factor that restricts the work is our lack of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not coordinate because we are not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, there is a lack of harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Another factor that restricts the work is that we still have a problem with our skills.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In some places there is not enough perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We even replace the saints in their service.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is also a factor that restricts the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In summary, there are several factors that restrict the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are limited by what we have learned and are doing, we are not broken, we lack coordination and harmony, and we replace the saints instead of perfecting them because we lack skills.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord has still used us, and our work has some results, but these factors limit the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the Lord was not limited, the work would be stronger, and it would have reached more places.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Spreading and Strengthening</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the one hand, we need to spread abroad, but on the other hand, we still have some weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not have a strong model because of our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It may be of the Lord that believers regard us too highly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On this trip I felt that the Lord opened a door that no one can shut.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord has opened the door and done the work; hence, we should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whether in the Far East or in the West, the Lord values our meetings and people regard them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the reason that believers came to us and asked for instructions and help.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is true that believers regard us too highly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They consider the meetings in Taiwan or a brother who says that he is from Taiwan to be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Wherever we went, we said that the situation in Taiwan is not so good and that there are many saints who are dormant and many saints who are still childish.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even though we said this, wherever we went, the believers waited for us to speak, they asked us for help, and they expected us to lead the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They regarded us too highly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are not that high; we have many weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This fellowship is for us to consider which way the Lord is leading us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Should we strengthen the work and establish a model, or should we spread abroad?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May the Lord enlighten every one of us.</S>
