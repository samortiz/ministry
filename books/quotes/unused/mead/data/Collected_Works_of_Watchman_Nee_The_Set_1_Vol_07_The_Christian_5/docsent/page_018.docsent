   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WORLD CONVENTION OF JEWISH YOUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A world convention of Jewish youths was held in Paris recently.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eight languages were used, and many problems were discussed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This time, sixty persons attended.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They hope to have the next convention in 1929 on a larger scale.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the new Hebrew University in Jerusalem has only sixty students, the funding of the school is on a solid financial foundation, and the school organization is fairly satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The school itself is the highest expression of Jewish nationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>MISCELLANEOUS EVENTS IN PALESTINE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Jewish silk factory in Vienna is about to open up a silk farm in Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Palestine will soon have its own coins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HEBREW CONVENTION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of June this year, there was a Jewish convention in Buffalo in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will quote the report of the New York Report:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was the twenty-ninth convention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The most open demonstration of their meeting was their mass congregation at the concert hall with two thousand in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most of them are delegates to the convention and local Jews from Buffalo.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The meeting was held on Sunday evening, and the hall was adorned with Zionist decorations, which filled the ceiling and the four walls with blue and white colors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These two colors are a symbol of Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their leader, David Yellin, gave a speech in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While he was speaking, the audience would applaud intermittently.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This showed their appreciation of his words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yellin described the changes that had taken place in the Jewish land within the past six years, that wars had turned Palestine into a rubble, and that other factors had caused the Palestinian population to dwindle to forty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But now they are beginning to walk out of these tribulations, and a young and strong colony is being formed, with a population of more than one hundred fifty thousand and growing faster year by year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yellin also said,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In my opinion, our work toward the Hebrew language and in Palestine during the past six years exceeds that of the last thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now the time is near; through this material and spiritual growth, the Palestinian Jews are able to attain a strength undreamed of ten years ago and to build up a Jewish nation with five hundred thousand Jews closely knitted together....I send you greetings on behalf of the Congress of our Jewish homeland.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This homeland is advancing day by day before our eyes, and its hidden life is being made manifest...These three days as I sat together with you, I felt like I was sitting together with all the Israelites in the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your faith has been strengthened through your contact with each other and with your leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have set your minds to make the coming year shine with splendor, so that the work done in Palestine in previous years would be pale by comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should press on as you have resolved to do, and perhaps you will receive more than you have hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After reading this speech, we can see how earnest were his words and how full of life they are!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Jews have high hopes indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the prophecies in the Bible, the Jews will be revived before Christ comes back again, and they will return to their homeland and will prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Christ comes, they will receive Him as the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In observing the vigorous and prospering condition of the Jews, we have to admit that the recovery of the nation of Israel must be a reality before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fig tree has indeed sprouted, and summer is near.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors" Matt 24:33 .</S>
