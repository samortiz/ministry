<h2 class="head2">God's Mercy</h2><p>Every spiritual thing is received by men who are balanced and who are just right in everything. We can neither be too much nor too little. Those who are over-zealous in their pursuit will not receive anything. Neither will those who are lazy receive anything. When we ask, we have to ask in a proper measure; we cannot ask for nothing, and we cannot ask for too much. Sometimes when we ask more, it will be too much, and when we ask less, it will be too little. We need God's mercy. Spiritual growth does not depend on a person's running. But then, those who do not run will not receive anything either. If God grants you mercy, you will run according to just the right measure. For this reason, everyone has to commit himself to the God of all mercies (Rom. 9:16). If we do this, we will become just right in everything.</p><p>Today we can only say that we are those who have experienced God's mercy. Spiritual growth is something that is totally beyond man's power to control. God has to put us in a place of total inability and total helplessness before He can have a way in us. If the Lord is merciful to us, we will get through. If the Lord is not merciful to us, we can do nothing. Many people receive frequent chastisements, yet their outward man is not broken at all. In order to become a minister, the only way is for us to look to God's mercy. No one can be in haste in this matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Deeper Knowledge of the Lord's Life<br />through the Lord's Dealings</h2><p>Yu Cheng-hwa: Can we say that the content of the ministry is our knowledge of life?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We know the Lord by learning the lessons through His dealings and smitings. When our outward man is broken, we will begin to know the Lord. A man knows the Lord through the process of being smitten. When we are smitten by the Lord day by day, our knowledge of the Lord will increase day by day, and we will see how His life replaces our life. This is not an increase in life, but an increase in knowledge. We have this life already. But through the Lord's dealings, we will gain a deeper knowledge of this life.</p><h2 class="head2">Passing through the Dealings<br />to Know the Riches of the Lord's Life</h2><p>The life that all the believers receive is a rich life. Yet we do not realize how rich this life is. It is only when our outward shell is broken that we realize how rich the Lord's life is and how it can achieve things that we cannot achieve.</p><p>During the war in Europe, one man was hit by forty-seven bullets, yet he still lived. A man's body can take in as many as forty-seven bullets and yet still live. Some people are very healthy, and their bodies have never been cut once. These people have not yet found out the amount of abuse the body can endure. The riches of the Lord's life are beyond any of our imaginations. Hence, no one should feel sad about the trials that come upon him. Trials are there not only to test a man's faith; the purpose of these trials is for the Lord's life to be expressed. God measures to us all kinds of circumstances and environments in order that we would receive the benefit of knowing Him. Only those who have passed through the dealings will know God, and only those who know God will be able to serve Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Paying a High Price for the Lord to Have a Way</h2><p>Today our outward man has to be broken before the inward man can be built up. We have to consecrate ourselves in a desperate way to the Lord before He will bring us through. If we do not put ourselves in His hand in a desperate way, the Lord will do nothing. There was once a sister who had an argument with her family, and she threatened to kill herself. She told everyone that she was going to jump into the river. The family followed her to the edge of the water. But when they saw her carefully holding up her skirts, they realized that she was not going to kill herself. Today, unless we are reckless in giving up everything, we will not have a way to go on. If a man worries about this and that, if he always makes sure that he is not too much, and if he is always careful and afraid, he will not be able to go on. A man has to learn to pay the price in a desperate way. If we want to be a Christian, we have to be one in a desperate and thorough way. Today is the end time. We need desperate people. Otherwise, there will be no spiritual future for us. It is difficult for those who go halfway and then are reluctant and unwilling at heart to go on. Among us, we need to have some desperate ones to rise up. Only then will the Lord have a way.</p>
