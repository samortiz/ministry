   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bearing the Sins of Many</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the cross Christ bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross God took all our sins and put them upon this Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hebrews 9:28 says that Christ has been "once offered to bear the sins of many."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ died once to bear our sins, and He suffered the judgment for us on the cross Isa 53:5, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Peter 2:24 tells us that Christ "carried up our sins in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The tree in this verse denotes the cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment for the execution of malefactors, as prophesied in the Old Testament Deut 21:23; Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sins here, as in Hebrews 9:28, refer to sins we commit in our outward conduct, whereas sin in John 1:29 refers to the sin that is in our nature by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ died for our sins, carrying up our sins onto the cross, that we might be forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Literally, in 1 Peter 2:24 "having died to sins" means being away from sins; hence, having died to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the death of Christ we have died to sins Rom 6:8, 10-11, 18 so that we might live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This living to righteousness is in the resurrection of Christ Eph 2:6; John 14:19; 2 Tim 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ carried up our sins onto the cross and died, that death accomplished many things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The death of Christ terminated us, and this termination can keep us away from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through Christ's death we can be kept away from sins so that we may live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As fallen human beings, we were dead and full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Christ put our sins upon Himself and carried them up onto the tree, the cross, where He suffered God's righteous judgment for all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ's death on the cross was a bruise, and that bruise, that death, has healed our death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we have become alive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, Christ's bruise that heals us keeps us away from sins through His death; on the other hand, this healing enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The subjective aspect of the cross of Christ continues in our experience today by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life-giving Spirit is working within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ's cross in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ's death has drawn a separating line between us and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now through His death we are being kept away from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the objective cross becoming subjective to us in our experience through the working of the life-giving Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we call on the name of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the life-giving Spirit operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Spontaneously we experience the subjective working of the cross to make a separation between us and sins so that we automatically live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Becoming a Curse on Our Behalf and Redeeming Us out of the Curse of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His work on the cross Christ became a curse on our behalf and redeemed us out of the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree" Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ as our Substitute on the cross not only bore the curse for us but also became a curse for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The curse of the law issued from the sin of man Gen 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ took away our sin on the cross, He redeemed us out of the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the problem of sin has been solved, the problem of the curse has been solved as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As descendants of Adam, all sinners are under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Romans 5 we see that Adam brought us all under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the curse was not made official until the law was given.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now the law declares that all the fallen descendants of Adam are under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the cross He was even made a curse for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the curse that came in through Adam's fall has been dealt with by Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The origin of the curse is man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God brought in the curse after Adam's sin, saying, "Cursed is the ground for thy sake" Gen 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sign of the curse is thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, after Adam's sin, the earth brought forth thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, the curse is carried out through the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the law administers the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the curse is related to the law of God; it is the demand of the righteous God upon sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Christ bore our sins, He also took our curse.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The crown of thorns indicates this John 19:2, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since thorns are a sign of the curse, Christ's wearing a crown of thorns indicates that He took our curse on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only did Christ redeem us out from the curse; He even became a curse on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This indicates that He was absolutely abandoned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God forsook Christ economically and also considered Him a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the cross Christ accomplished the great work of bringing us out from the curse of the law, working to bear our sins and to remove the curse.</S>
