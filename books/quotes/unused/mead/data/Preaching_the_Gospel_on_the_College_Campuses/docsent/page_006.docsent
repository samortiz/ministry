   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Experience of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we behave and work in the Spirit, the Spirit will direct us to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first thing we have to understand about the Body is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Body is one Eph 4:4; Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The people who are in denominations and divisions cannot realize and practice the real Body life because they are not on the genuine ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The oneness of the Body can only be maintained on the unique ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the people who went back to Jerusalem under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah in the Old Testament were able to rebuild the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who remained in Babylon could not help with this rebuilding work because they were not on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the divisions, Christians may enjoy the Spirit a little, but there is no possibility of having the real Body life in any division.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must act, behave, and work in the Body and with the Body on the genuine ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I began to talk about the young people going to the campus to preach the gospel, a number of the older saints began to think that they were being excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a wrong understanding of my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need all the saints of every age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Preaching the gospel is a work for the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not do the gospel work in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must do it in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need the young people to go to the campuses, especially those who are eighteen and nineteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the young people in the church life are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why we have to work with our high schoolers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After graduating from high school, they all will be on the campuses to effectively contact the freshmen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People over twenty-five have a more difficult time in contacting freshmen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are not as useful and prevailing as the younger saints on the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is an open door for the eighteen-year-old freshmen to contact other freshmen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A person is most effective when he contacts a person who is his same age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Someone who is eighteen may not easily talk with me because I am much older than he is, but it is so easy for an older man to talk with me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can talk because we are birds of the same feather.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Birds of the same feather can talk together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The young people's preaching of the gospel on the campuses, however, should be in coordination with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since we may not have that many young ones, we need many homes of the saints for coordination in the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every young person who goes to the campus needs a home for his contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A young person who catches eighteen new ones should be able to bring all eighteen into the living rooms of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need living rooms to receive all these new contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the ages can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one is too old.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The older saints can open up their homes to these new contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though the older saints have opened their homes, they can keep themselves in the background and invite some middle-aged saints to serve the new ones in the living room.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The younger you are, the more you should be in the front to take care of the new young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The older you are, the more you should be at the back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would be good for the older ones to buy the groceries, cook the food, and wash the dishes to serve the young people and their contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The young ones should go to the campus and the middle-aged saints should serve the young people in the living room.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our living rooms should be filled with the enjoyment of Christ, especially through singing and psalming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such an atmosphere of enjoyment and mutuality requires a great deal of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If all the churches practice preaching the gospel in the campus work in this way, we will have a prevailing church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One of the best ways for the churches to get new contacts is to send our young people to the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The best fishing ponds for the Lord's recovery are the college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should send our fishermen to the fishing ponds.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the older saints can stay home to prepare snacks, refreshments, and the best dinners to gather the new contacts at least once every four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The living rooms will catch them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need a young army that can be sent to the campuses to bring in more young people, but all the older and middle-aged saints are also needed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not be discouraged that we may be too old to go to the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church's gospel preaching needs all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because the local churches in the Lord's recovery are standing on the genuine ground of oneness, we can have a very good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all need to learn so that we can have the best coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not preach the gospel in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We also should not invite people to our homes or serve them dinner in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should do everything corporately in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This needs much fellowship and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have the faith to apply the truth in the Bible, we will have the power, and if we have the coordination in the Body, nothing will frustrate our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our preaching will be powerful and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we will gain many young people for the Lord's recovery in this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What we need is the revelation and experience of the Spirit and the Body.</S>
