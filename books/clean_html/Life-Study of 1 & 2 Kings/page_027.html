<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. His Prayer</H2><P>Verses 22 through 53 are a record of Solomon's prayer. My burden here is that we would see the intrinsic significance of this prayer. If we would apprehend the intrinsic significance of Solomon's prayer, we need spiritual wisdom and spiritual revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Asking God to Pay Constant Attention<br>to the House He Built for God</H2><P>In his prayer Solomon asked God to pay constant attention to the house he built for God (vv. 22-29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Supplicating God to Hear<br>from His Dwelling Place in the Heavens</H2><P>Solomon supplicated God to hear from His dwelling place in the heavens the prayers offered to Him by His people toward this dwelling place of His on the earth that Solomon had prepared for God. Here we see that God has two dwelling places&#151;one in the heavens and one on earth. Actually, these two are one, for they are the two ends of God's dwelling place. One end is in the heavens, and the other is on earth. Today, as believers in Christ, we are a particular people, a people who are in the heavens and on earth, on earth and in the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) In Judging God's People</H2><P>Solomon supplicated God to hear the prayers of his people in a very definite way, mentioning seven conditions concerning God's listening to the prayers of His elect. First, Solomon asked God to hear in judging His people, condemning the wicked and justifying the righteous (vv. 31-32). God exercises His ruling among His people according to His justice; that is, He condemns the wicked and justifies the righteous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) In the Defeat of His People</H2><P>Solomon went on to ask God that when His people were defeated, He would hear their supplication from the heavens and bring them back to the land He gave to their fathers (vv. 33-34).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) In Drought</H2><P>Solomon continued by praying that in drought God would forgive His people's sin and bring rain upon His land, which He had given to His people for an inheritance (vv. 35-36).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) In Famine and Pestilence</H2><P>Next, Solomon prayed that during a time of famine and pestilence God would forgive and bring to each man according to all his ways (vv. 37-40).</P>
