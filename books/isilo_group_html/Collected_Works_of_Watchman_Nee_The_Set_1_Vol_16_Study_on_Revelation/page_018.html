Revelation 5:6</H2><P>"And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."</P><P>"A Lamb standing." This is the scene at the time of the Lord's ascension to the heavens. "Having seven horns and seven eyes." Horns signify power because the horns of the ox and the ram are powerful. Hence, in the Bible there are such expressions as "our horn shall be exalted" (Psa. 89:17), "the horn of my salvation" (Psa. 18:2), and so forth. Eyes signify intelligence. The seven Spirits of God are not there to shine on God but are there as torches of fire sent forth into the dark places. The seven Spirits upon the Lord Jesus cause Him to have power, intelligence, and so forth (Isa. 11:2). The seven Spirits cause us to draw nearer to the Lord and to praise Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 5:7</H2><P>"And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne."</P><P>As soon as He took the scroll, there were praises in heaven and on the earth. The New Testament is executed through the hand of the Lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE PRAISES OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES<br>AND THE TWENTY-FOUR ELDERS<br>(REVELATION 5:8-10)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 5:8-9</H2><P>"And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints. And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation." </P><P>The purpose for the prayers of the saints (v. 8) is the Lord's coming again. Harps are for praising and "bowls full of incense" are for presenting the prayers. "A new song." Because the Lord had died only a short time before, it is a new song. "Every tribe and tongue and people and nation." Four is the number of the earth. "Have purchased...men." These "men" are not the twenty-four elders because the verse does not say "have purchased us."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 5:10</H2><P>"And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."</P><P>Based upon these words, are not all believers made kings and priests? Indeed, we can say this. Our salvation is based upon the Lord's death, but the procedure of salvation is based upon man's faith. In the same way, our being kings and priests before God is based upon the accomplishments of the Lord's blood, but the procedure through which we obtain this is based upon our behavior.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE PRAISES OF THE ANGELS AND THE CREATURES<br>(REVELATION 5:11-13)</H2><P>"And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and of the living creatures and of the elders, and their number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them, I heard saying, To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever."</P><P>Verses 11 and 12 are the praises of the angels, the twenty-four elders, and the living creatures. Verse 13 contains the praises of all the creatures in the universe and the praises of the four living creatures.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
