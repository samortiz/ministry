        <h2 class="head1">GOD MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is God mingled with man. God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to enter into man and be joined with man. God wanted man to receive Him and be joined to Him, but man failed. Hence, God became a man and put on humanity, taking the image and likeness of a man and possessing the human life and nature. Now He is one with man and inseparable from man. When He lived on the earth, He was the Son of Man who put on humanity and had a body of flesh and blood, and even after being designated the Son of God in His resurrection, He still has a body of flesh and bones and the human nature (Rom. 1:4; Luke 24:39; John 20:27). Furthermore, now that He is sitting at the right hand of God in His ascension, He is still the Son of Man with the human nature (Acts 7:55-56). Ultimately, in His second coming in the glory of God, He will be the Son of Man, still in possession of His human nature (Matt. 26:64). He is not only God joined to man in time, but God joined and mingled with man for eternity. Just as God possesses the divine life and nature, the Lord Jesus possesses the divine life and nature. Just as God possesses might and glory, the Lord Jesus also possesses might and glory. The Lord is a genuine man, and He is also God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMMANUEL</h2>
<p>Even though the Lord Jesus was a man in the flesh, He was God coming to be with man. Therefore, He was given the name Emmanuel. He was called by the name Jesus and also by the name Emmanuel. God gave Him the name Jesus, but people called His name Emmanuel, meaning &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:21, 23). As the embodiment of God, the Lord Jesus is the declaration and manifestation of God among men (John 1:18). He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15). He is God. When He was among men, God was among men. Therefore, He said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</h2>
<p>The Lord allowed people to worship Him and call Him God, because He is God manifested in the flesh, God living among men and with men (Matt. 8:2; 20:20; John 20:28). This is the great mystery of godliness (1 Tim. 3:16). God was hidden in man, His glory was concealed within human flesh, and the Creator was joined to His creatures. What a mystery! This was not only God mingled with man but also eternity joined to time, heaven united with earth, and the invisible blended with the visible. The eternal God was mingled with man in time, God in heaven was joined to man on earth, and the Creator was blended with His creatures. Hence, time, space, and creation were joined to God, were filled with God, and expressed God. Therefore, this mystery is great and godly. <em>Godly</em> means that God is manifested so that man can see Him. The Word becoming flesh was for God to be manifested in man, that is, in time, space, and creation, so that God could be seen by man. This is a great mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD REVEALING JESUS AS THE CHRIST</h2>
<p>The central revelation of the Bible is God becoming a man in order to be mingled with man. In the Gospel of Matthew God revealed to Peter that Jesus is the Son of God (16:13-17). When Peter ranked Jesus with Moses, who represents the law, and with Elijah, who represents the prophets, God came in and said that Jesus, the Son of Man, is His beloved Son (17:1-8). Even people as great as Moses and Elijah cannot be ranked with His beloved Son. The Lord told the Pharisees that He is the son of David and also the Lord of David (22:41-45). Romans 1:3-4 says, &ldquo;Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; On the one hand, as the son of David, the Lord is a man, and on the other hand, as the Lord of David, He is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PEOPLE BELIEVING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>While living as a man in the flesh, Christ repeatedly said that God was in Him and that He was in God; that is, Christ was mingled with God (John 10:38; 14:10). Although Christ was manifested as the Son of Man, He wanted people to believe that He is the Son of God (9:35-38). Christ was a man with a human body, but He wanted people to believe that He is God (20:27-29). The Bible testifies that Jesus is the Son of God so that by believing we may have life in His name (v. 31). In order to be saved we must confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in our heart that God has raised Him from the dead (Rom. 10:9). To call Him Jesus is to confess that He is a man, but to call Him Lord is to confess that He is God. When we believe and confess that Jesus is the Son of God, we abide in God and He in us (1 John 5:5; 4:15). The Bible also says, &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either,&rdquo; because the Son has declared the Father (2:23; 2 John 9; John 1:18). Believing that Jesus is the Son of God enables us to receive eternal life, because He is the true God and eternal life (1 John 5:11-12, 20). We must believe that Jesus is the incarnated God. We must believe that He is God and that He is also a man. He is God yet man and man yet God. We must believe that Christ has both the divine life and nature and the human life and nature and that He bears the likeness of a man and the image of God. Jesus Christ is God joined to and mingled with man. This is what we must believe, and this is what Satan refuses to confess.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
