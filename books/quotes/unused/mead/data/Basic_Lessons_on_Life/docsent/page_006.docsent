   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PUTTING MAN BEFORE THE TREE OF LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>INDICATING THAT GOD WANTED MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO RECEIVE HIM AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God put man before the tree of life, indicating that God wanted man to receive Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to see that at the very beginning, God had no intention to ask man to keep any law, to do anything good, or to bear any kind of burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the very beginning, right after God created man, God only put man in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicated that God wanted man to receive Him as life, signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God also warned man that he should be careful about his eating.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, what man did was altogether up to his own free will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What he chose to eat was up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But God's desire was that man would choose the tree of life, which means that man would choose God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>X. MAN BEING CREATED A VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO RECEIVE AND CONTAIN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man was created as a vessel to receive and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is fully revealed in Romans 9:21 and 23 and 2 Corinthians 4:7.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Romans 9 we are told that God is a potter, and we are the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Potter made the clay vessels, and He made us vessels of mercy, vessels unto honor, and even vessels unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our being vessels to contain God is not because we are so good and preferable to God; it is altogether a matter of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God had mercy upon us, and He wanted us to be His vessels, so we are the vessels of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are vessels of honor because we contain the God of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, we all will be filled with God's glory and glorified in the glory of God to become the vessels unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, God created us as vessels vessels of mercy, vessels of honor, and vessels unto glory to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must see that God's creation is to make us vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must stress this one point in this message that man was made a vessel with a human spirit as a receptacle to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the first message concerning life in our training.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to make it so clear and so impressive to all the trainees that the creation of man was just to make man a vessel with a receptacle, that is, our spirit, to receive God into us as our life.</S>
