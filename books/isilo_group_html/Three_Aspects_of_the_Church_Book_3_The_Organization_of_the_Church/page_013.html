HAVING TWO ASPECTS</h2>
<p>The church has both a universal and a local aspect, and its organization also has a universal and a local aspect.</p>
<p>In terms of organization, the apostles are related to the universal church. In the Scriptures none of the apostles were apostles in relation only to a single local church. The office of an apostle is universal, not local, whereas the office of an elder or a deacon is local. If an elder in the church in Kaohsiung moves to Taipei, he will not necessarily be appointed an elder of the church in Taipei. If a person has been appointed to be an elder in one locality, he does not automatically continue in that office should he move somewhere else. If a brother is an elder in Kaohsiung, he may not even be appointed to be a deacon if he moves to Taipei. However, an apostle will continue to be an apostle whether he is in Kaohsiung or Taipei. Offices related to a locality are restricted to that locality. However, apostleship is not restricted to a particular locality.</p>
<p>The basic constituents of both the universal church and the local churches are the same; that is, in both its universal and local aspects the church is constituted of people who have the life of Christ. However, there is a distinction in regard to the offices in the church. This distinction corresponds to the churches universal and local aspects. The office of an apostle is altogether related to the universal church, whereas the office of an elder or deacon is related only to a local church. The sphere of these offices should never be confused.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICES AND GIFTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Definition of Offices and Gifts</h2>
<p>According to the organization of the church, there is a distinction between the offices related to the universal and local aspects of the church. Moreover, there is also a distinction between office and gift. Being an elder or a deacon is a matter of office, not gift. However, to speak for God as a prophet is a matter of gift, not office. All offices are on the administrative side, and all gifts are on the spiritual side. In other words, offices are for administration and government, and gifts are for spiritual building up. These two aspects are closely related, yet they are quite distinct from each other.</p>
<p>According to the universal and local aspects of the church, the office of the apostles and the offices of the elders and deacons are not related to the same sphere. Apostles are universal, whereas elders and deacons are local. To be an apostle, elder, or deacon is a matter of office. However, to be a prophet, teacher, or evangelist is not a matter of office. Among the offices in the church, in the universal aspect as well as the local aspect, apostles have the highest office, then elders, and then deacons. Each has an office in the church.</p>
<p>Among the gifts there is also a distinction. Some gifts are for the church, and some are for individuals. The gifts that God gives to the church are for the church, and the gifts that He gives to an individual are related to the individual. The gifts given by God to the church are persons, as spoken of in Ephesians 4:7-16. After Christ ascended to heaven, He gave various gifts to the church. He gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers (v. 11). Christ gave these persons as gifts to the church. The church receives these gifts; thus, they are for the church.</p>
<p>The gifts that individuals receive are spiritual abilities and capabilities. Through the Holy Spirit, God gives certain individuals the ability to teach. This ability is a gift given to them by God. Such gifts are referred to as gifts for individuals. Among these gifts for individuals, some are ordinary and others are miraculous. Ordinary gifts are those spoken of in Romans 12:4-21. Love for one another is included among these gifts. Our seeing the brothers off at the train station is also a matter of an ordinary gift. According to Romans 12, the gifts that we have received are different. Some of us do one thing, and others do something else. Some may love people, and others may give hospitality. These gifts are ordinary gifts given to individuals.</p>
<p>The other kind of gifts are the miraculous gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12:9-10. These include speaking in tongues, interpreting tongues, healing, and carrying out operations of works of power. However, there is a gift that is both ordinary and miraculous. This is the gift of prophecy. To prophesy is to speak for God and speak forth God, including predicting and foretelling. The emphasis in 1 Corinthians 12 is predicting, which is miraculous, whereas in Romans 12 the emphasis is not on predicting but on speaking for God as a prophet. The Greek word translated &ldquo;prophesy&rdquo; also means &ldquo;predict.&rdquo; Every person who functions as a mouthpiece of God speaks for God and thus is a prophet. Sometimes a person&rsquo;s speaking may be a prediction, and sometimes it may be an ordinary teaching.</p>
<p>The ordinary teaching rendered by a prophet is related to his regular spiritual learning. Based on his regular learning, when he is inspired, he will rise up to speak for the edification of the saints. This is to prophesy. Strictly speaking, this is not predicting. It is an ordinary gift. At another time a person may have the instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit and rise up to speak a word of prediction. This is what happened in the case of Agabus. He rose up and predicted that there was about to be a great famine over the whole inhabited earth (Acts 11:27-28). His prediction was a miraculous gift, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12, and was the result of inspiration.</p>
<p>According to the organization of the church, there is a distinction between the offices as they relate to the universal and local aspects of the church, and there is also a distinction between offices and gifts. With respect to offices, they either are related to the universal church or to the local church. With respect to gifts, they are either for the church or for individuals. In the entire Bible only three portions speak of gifts. The first portion is Ephesians 4, which tells us that some gifts were given by Christ to the church. The second portion is Romans 12, which speaks of ordinary gifts, such as showing mercy. The third portion is 1 Corinthians 12, which speaks of miraculous gifts, such as speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, and healing. The following outline shows the distinctions between the types of offices and the types of gifts:</p>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Offices:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Universal&mdash;apostles.</li>
	<li>Local&mdash;elders and deacons.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Gifts:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>For the church (Eph. 4).</li>
	<li>For individuals:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Ordinary gifts (Rom. 12).</li>
		<li>Miraculous gifts (1 Cor. 12).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Strictly speaking, the apostleship is the only office in the universal church, but in a broader sense prophets as well as shepherds and teachers are also offices in the universal church.</p>
<p>How do we distinguish between offices and gifts? To have an office is a matter of appointment, whereas to have a gift is a matter of ability. For example, to be a carpenter is a matter of ability, but to become a foreman is a matter of office. Although two carpenters may have the same ability, one may be a senior foreman and the other a junior foreman. Even though both have the same ability, they may have different offices. Let us use another example. On one hand, to be a teacher is a matter of gift; on the other hand, it is an office. In terms of the ability to teach, a teacher has a gift, but in terms of being hired to teach, a teacher has an office. This should be very clear.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Importance of Offices and Gifts</h2>
<p>In the church both the gifts and the offices are indispensable. An office may be compared to a husband, and a gift, to a wife; we should never emphasize one and neglect the other. Nevertheless, in their spiritual pursuit, most Christians pay more attention to gifts than to offices.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries there have always been problems in regard to the organization of the church. Most of the problems have been due to offices. Gifts tend to be less problematic, but it is very easy for problems and mistakes to arise in relation to offices. If a person is not gifted yet claims to be gifted, others quickly can detect his lack of gift. However, it may be difficult to tell whether or not a person has a certain office. While it is difficult to pretend to have a gift, it is much easier to pretend to have an office. This is why the matter of having an office gives rise to more problems than the matter of having a gift. There is no human hand in the formation of gifts. People cannot arrange for someone to be a prophet or for another to be an evangelist. However, human hands are involved in the appointment of offices. The appointment of offices must pass through human hands, as in the laying on of hands by the apostles in Acts 14:23 and Titus 1:5. Church history tells us that the majority of the problems in the church are due to offices. This is why most of those who pursue the Lord desire gifts and despise offices. However, it is not sufficient to have only gifts.</p>
<p>Office is a matter of authority, and gift is a matter of spirituality. First Corinthians 12 is a chapter on spiritual gifts. When the church lacks gifts, it lacks spiritual things. However, gifts are not life. There is a difference between the two. The primary requirement for someone to speak as a prophet is that he must be spiritual; that is, he must have the Holy Spirit operating in him. In recent years many people have paid too much attention to spirituality and disregarded authority. This is to be extreme. On the other hand, in organized Christianity the emphasis is altogether related to office, to man&rsquo;s authority, and gifts are neglected. This is also to be extreme. Although some preachers have been appointed to their offices, they do not have the gift of preaching. Their appointment is merely an official arrangement, and it is a mistake. Hence, although they are appointed to be &ldquo;carpenters,&rdquo; they do not know how to use a &ldquo;hammer.&rdquo; However, if we try to correct such mistakes by caring only for gifts and neglecting offices, this will also be a mistake. In the organization of the church there must be gifts as well as offices. In the church there needs to be spirituality as well as authority.</p>
<p>If in the church there are only gifts, there will be no authority, and if there are no gifts, there will be no offices. If there are spiritual gifts in the church, there should also be authority; otherwise, the church will be weak. Under normal conditions a church should take care of both matters: spirituality and authority. When both these matters are properly coordinated, all the problems of the church will be solved spontaneously.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
