   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE A LIFE FULL OF FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT WITHOUT ANXIETY 4 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:4-7, 10-13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we emphasized the need of forbearance in our married life, family life, and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the building up of the church, the elders and all the saints need to exercise forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, for a pleasant married life and an excellent family life we need to be forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that all the saints with children will be deeply impressed with the need to exercise forbearance in their daily living at home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE MEANING OF FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word rendered forbearance in 4:5 is composed of two words: epi, a preposition which means unto, and eikos, which means seemly, fitting, or suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the preposition epi is added to other Greek words as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider, for example, the word epignosis used in 2 Timothy 2:25.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this verse Paul speaks of the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, epi added to gnosis gives a word which means full knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The use of this preposition as a component of the Greek word for forbearance in 4:5 indicates that the meaning of this word is to be fully reasonable, or fitting or suitable to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to have a full and extensive reasonableness and considerateness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, we need to act in a way that is fitting and suitable to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these meanings are included in the Greek word used by Paul in 4:5.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek word rendered forbearance in 4:5 is not actually a noun; it is an adjective used as a noun with a definite article.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This use of an adjective as a noun serves to emphasize the meaning of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, in 1 Timothy 6:17 Paul says, Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is more emphatic than saying, Charge the rich man not to be high-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 4:5 Paul deliberately uses an adjective as a noun in order to place special emphasis on forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A RICH SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the previous message we pointed out that forbearance requires understanding, wisdom, patience, and many other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would be forbearing, we need to be merciful, kind, and compassionate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, to forbear definitely requires a certain ability in a number of areas.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need the ability to understand, to be patient, to help others, and to afford them the necessary supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His forbearance toward us, God certainly has given us a rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God forbears with fallen man for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His purpose in showing forbearance is to accomplish His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God did not afford man the adequate supply and show forbearance to man, there would be no way for God to fulfill His purpose of accomplishing His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>REJOICING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that forbearance requires maturity and also satisfaction and contentment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we need to see that forbearance is also related to rejoicing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 4:4 Paul says, Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Immediately after this he says, Let your forbearance be known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not rejoice in the Lord, we shall not be able to forbear.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would make known our forbearance, we need to be happy and joyful in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who are sad or sorrowful cannot have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, they find it easy to be upset, to complain, or to lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Forbearance in 4:5 is the issue, the result, of rejoicing in the Lord, mentioned in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From experience we know that rejoicing and forbearing go together.</S>
