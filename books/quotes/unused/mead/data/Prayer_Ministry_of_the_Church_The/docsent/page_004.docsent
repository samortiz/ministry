   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE GREAT PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have said that God has a will for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet God does not act independently; He will not do anything by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even though God has a will, He wants the free will on earth to echo His will before He does anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there is only a will in heaven, God will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The heavenly move is accomplished on earth only when the earth wants the same thing as heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today this is called the ministry of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, the ministry of the church is not only the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not mean that we should not preach the gospel; it means that the ministry of the church is not merely the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ministry of the church is to bring the will in heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How does the church bring the will in heaven to earth?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is by prayer on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prayer is not as small and insignificant as some may think.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not something that is dispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prayer is a work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Prayer is the church saying to God, "God, we want Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prayer is the church knowing God's heart and opening its mouth to ask for what is in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the church does not do this, it does not have much use on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many prayers for spiritual edification, prayers for fellowship, and prayers for supplication cannot replace prayers which are in the nature of work or ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If all your prayers are prayers for spiritual edification, fellowship, and supplication, they are too small.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A prayer which is in the nature of work or ministry is one in which you stand on God's side, wanting what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, if a prayer is uttered according to God's will, it is the most powerful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the church to pray means that it finds out God's will and speaks out this will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Prayer is not just asking God for something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the church to pray means that it stands on God's side to declare that man wants what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the church declares this, the declaration will be effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now let us consider three great principles in ministerial prayer from Matthew 18:18-20.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Speaking Out God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 18 the Lord says, "Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who is the "you" here?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the church because verse 17 mentions the church, and verse 18 is a continuation of verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever the church binds on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever the church looses on earth will be loosed in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a very important principle: today God works through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God cannot do anything at will; He has to do everything through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without going through the church, God cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, this is a very sober principle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God cannot do anything by Himself today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a free will besides His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this will does not cooperate with Him, He cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The amount of power that the church has expresses the amount of power that God has because His power is expressed through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has placed Himself in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The height and extent that the church reaches is the height and extent that God's power reaches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the power of the church is small and restricted, God cannot express the height or extensiveness of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The water department's reservoir may be great, but if you have only a small tap in your house, a great amount of water will not flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you want more water in your house, you have to install a larger pipe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the capacity of the church determines the degree to which God's power is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This can be seen from God's expression in Christ; the capacity of Christ is the degree of the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today God is expressed in the church; the capacity of the church determines the degree of the expression of God and also the amount of knowledge one can have about God.</S>
