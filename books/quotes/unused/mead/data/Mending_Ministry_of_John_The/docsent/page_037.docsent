   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By Calling On His Name</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we drink of Him?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we call on His name, we have the sense that we have had a refreshing drink.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout the day, if we call "O Lord Jesus!" a few times, we shall have a good drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Oftentimes during the course of my day, I feel weary from my writing, studying, reading, and listening to people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I pause to call "O Lord Jesus," I am refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I like to tell the Lord, "Lord, I still love You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord Jesus, I still love You."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It makes a big difference to my day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>People in this country like to stop and have a cup of coffee.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The real refreshment comes, not from a cup of coffee, but from calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 10:9 says, "That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have been criticized for saying that we are saved by calling on the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is it sufficient to listen to a gospel message and believe what is preached without calling on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose an unsaved one hears the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He recognizes that he is a sinner and believes that Jesus is the Son of God who died on the cross for his sins; that He was resurrected and is now the Redeemer and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is this adequate?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 10 says further, "For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are two sides here: one is believing; the other, calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The one who believes the gospel may say, "Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe You died for me."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is calling on the Lord, though only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that he is saved, but he is scarcely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later, however, while he is alone in his room, he may call out, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You died for me!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am a sinner, but Your blood was shed for me!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now he is more saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The louder he calls, the stronger will be his experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have a friend who was an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he got saved, he was rolling on the floor, repenting and calling out that he was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one told him to roll on the floor nor to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then he called out, "Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He got thoroughly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not only sinners whose thirst is quenched by calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Though I have been in the Lord for over fifty-five years, I still find that every time I call on the name of the Lord Jesus, I am refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People may say it is not refined to call out like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Possibly this is true, but I do enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I care more for the enjoyment of eating than for table manners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this compound Spirit are the death of Christ with its effectiveness, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This Spirit is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit and the Word cannot be separated from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit is compounded with all the excellent, divine elements as well as the humanity of Christ and His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the all-inclusive Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"But ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him" 1 John 2:20, 27, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>. The more we pray-read and the more we call on His name, the more His humanity will be anointed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This compound ointment is like paint.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we have our house painted, it gets one coating of paint and then another added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By pray-reading and calling on the name, the spiritual painting will add coating after coating to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then within us there will be both the humanity and the divinity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There will be the effectiveness of His death, by which all the negative things of our natural being will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We shall also have the power of His resurrection to nourish, strengthen, and sustain us with its heavenly supply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the church life we enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We enjoy both His humanity and His divinity; His death and its effectiveness; His resurrection and its power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our enjoyment cannot be denied, even by those who criticize us as being emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us disregard such criticisms.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us keep on pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let us keep on calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The enemy Satan hates the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The pray-reading and the calling he also hates.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But to us they are an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By means of the pray-reading and the calling we experience the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This ointment within us is moving and active.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Anointing is the noun form of the verb "to anoint."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The anointing is the moving of the ointment; in other words, the action of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the New Testament this compound Spirit is called "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many times Paul uses this term rather than Holy Spirit or Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For example, he says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit" Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is by this compound all-inclusive Spirit that we enjoy Him, that we live Christ, and that we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is the Spirit who makes the church life so living, rich, and uplifting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When John spoke of the anointing in his Epistle, he must have had in mind Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This reference in Moses' writings is the source of this matter of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the time of Moses there was only the type.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today we have the reality, the all-inclusive compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We enjoy Him by pray-reading and by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then John in his Revelation, the last book of the Bible, used "the Spirit" more than other terms or titles for the Spirit of God 2:7, 11, 17, 28; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This indicates eventually the Bible stresses "the Spirit" for our experience of the Triune God with all His achievements and attainments.</S>
