The third stage is the flow, the current to flow out the water, to bring the water to all places, to reach other places with the water
In Himself, God the Father cannot reach us, and even when expressed in God the Son, He still cannot reach us today
It is as the Spirit and by the Spirit that God the Father in God the Son can reach us, visit us, come upon us, and come into us
If we are not clear about the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit, we cannot properly know the truth concerning the Spirit
The Spirit upon us as clothing is the power from on high, while the Spirit within us as the water we drink is for life
On the one hand, we have the Spirit within us as life, and on the other hand, we have the Spirit upon us as power
The Spirit within us as life is likened to water for drinking, and the Spirit upon us as power is likened to clothing
In the Old Testament, when Elijah was taken up into the heavens, he left his outer garment, his mantle, to Elisha
On the one hand, the Holy Spirit is within us as the water we drink, and on the other hand, the Holy Spirit is upon us as our clothing
Acts 1:5 says, 'For John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now'
On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came down from heaven upon the disciples, and they were baptized in the Holy Spirit
It was at the time of His baptism in water that the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit came upon Him as a dove
The first promise concerning the Spirit was that the Lord Himself would ask the Father to send another Comforter, the Spirit of reality
Before that time, the one hundred twenty disciples prayed together for ten days in one accord, and they understood how to expound the Psalms
When the Lord was going to the cross, the disciples quarreled with one another about who would be the greatest
It was on the day of resurrection when the Lord came to them and breathed on them that they received the Spirit of reality and life
They gave up their country, their home in Galilee, and they stayed in Jerusalem under the threatenings of the people
At that time in Jerusalem the people were threatening them, but they had the boldness to stay there and pray in one accord for ten days
To drink water is to take water into us, but to be baptized in water is not to drink it; it is to get into the water
Concerning the righteous law of God, however, Jesus Christ as the Advocate is the attorney in the heavenly court always pleading for us
As we saw in the previous chapter, the work of the Holy Spirit is of two aspects: the inward aspect and the outward aspect
After His ascension, however, on the day of Pentecost, the Lord poured down the Holy Spirit from heaven upon the disciples as power
We are regenerated, and we have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but we need the infilling as something further
Both aspects are illustrated by water, but one aspect is to go into the water, while the other aspect is that the water comes into us
To be baptized in water is to get into the water, while to drink water is to take the water into us; these are two different actions
We may have the inward aspect of the Spirit-regeneration, indwelling, and infilling-but we may not have the outward aspect of the Spirit
We may have the drink within but not the clothing without, or we may have the clothing without but not the drink within
There are two kinds of filling with the Holy Spirit, the inward filling and the outward filling, which are illustrated by water
In English, however, they are translated into the same word; this causes people to be unclear about this matter
Acts 22 says And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven as of a rushing violent wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
Luke 1:15 says, 'For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall by no means drink wine and liquor
Verse 41 says, 'And when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit'
When Mary, the mother of the Lord, came to the mother of John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit came upon Elizabeth
He had received the outward filling on the day of Pentecost, but at this time the Holy Spirit came down upon him once more
They were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit for power, not for life; this filling was something coming down upon them
A little disciple laid his hands on Saul, who later became the apostle Paul, that Saul might be filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly
By all these verses we can be clear about the two kinds of filling: the inward filling and the outward filling
The Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit, so we must believe that He was filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit
At the age of thirty, before He came out to minister, He was baptized in the water, and the Holy Spirit came down upon Him as a dove
After a certain period of time, the Lord sent a disciple named Ananias to lay hands on him so that he might be filled outwardly
The adjective form of pleroo is pleres, referring to the condition after one has been filled with the Spirit inwardly
Verse 5 continues, 'And the word pleased all the multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit'
All these passages make it easy to realize that there are two aspects of the work of the Spirit: the inward filling and the outward filling
The Samaritans had received the Holy Spirit inwardly as life, but they had not received the Holy Spirit outwardly as power
They already had received the Spirit as life, but they had not received the Spirit coming down upon them as power
Verse 6 says, 'And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied'
If we compare Acts 19 with Ephesians 1, we can see that what the apostle asked about was not something inward but outward
We have the Holy Spirit dwelling within us; now it is a matter of whether or not we give Him the room within us
The baptism in the Holy Spirit is absolutely an accomplished fact, just as the crucifixion of the Lord is an accomplished fact
After the Lord ascended to the heavens He baptized the first part the Jewish part of His Body into the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
After this, He ascended and poured down the Holy Spirit upon His Body so that we could have the baptism of the Holy Spirit
By His crucifixion and resurrection we have forgiveness of sins and eternal life, and by His ascension we have the Holy Spirit
The Body has been baptized into the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is now upon the Body, and now we have become members of the Body
We need a representative member of the Body to contact us so that the Holy Spirit on the Body can come upon us through that contact
The baptism in the Spirit already has been accomplished on the Body, the Spirit is upon the Body, and we are members of the Body
Sometimes the Lord does give us a feeling, and we can sense the baptism, but whether or not we sense it, we have the liberty and the release
Now we have become members of the Body, we are right with the Body, and we take this standing and claim it by faith
In the same way, we must take the fact, saying, 'Lord, You have ascended to the heavens and have poured down Your Spirit upon the Body
We have seen clearly from the teachings of the Scriptures that the work of the Holy Spirit is of two different aspects
The Holy Spirit within us as life is the inward aspect, and the Holy Spirit upon us as power is the outward aspect
In addition, this Spirit dwells within us to be the very Paraclete, the Comforter, the One who takes care of us in our daily life
We may have the Spirit within us as life, yet it is very possible that we have not experienced the Holy Spirit as power upon us
In order to have a proper life and walk as a Christian, we need the Holy Spirit within us as life day by day, even moment by moment
We may have a very spiritual daily walk, yet when we go to preach the gospel to people, we find that we are weak
We feel that we are bound by something we are not released and we do not have the boldness the encouragement to speak something for the Lord
We are nice and spiritual in our daily Christian walk, but we are weak in the service, in the preaching of the gospel, and in the ministry
Before that day, the disciples already had the Holy Spirit within them as life, but they did not have the Holy Spirit upon them as power
After that time, on the day of Pentecost, Peter and the other apostles did not manifest how much life they had or how spiritual they were
We can know how to discern the soul from the spirit, and we may know how to walk and do things in the spirit and not the soul
The infilling of the Spirit is for our spiritual life, while the outpouring of the Spirit upon us is for spiritual service
We cannot find the word release used in this way in the New Testament, but we can demonstrate it by the experience of many saints
Her speaking was even terrifying because she had the Holy Spirit upon her not only as power but also as her release
If the Spirit comes down upon us like burning electricity, our speaking in tongues is miraculous and truly genuine
We cannot exercise to speak in tongues in a genuine way at any time without having the Holy Spirit coming upon us
If we have something other than power, we should not believe it, because the main purpose for the Holy Spirit coming upon us is for power
The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes'
We have release, and third we have a gift as a manifestation, such as one of the nine gifts in 1 Corinthians 12
Once, a number of brothers were dealing with an unbelieving schoolmate, doing their best to convince him and win his soul
When the Holy Spirit comes upon us, we may not have a special manifestation, but we will have a gift, especially for gospel preaching
In the first case, all the disciples were powerful on the day of Pentecost, and they had the release, boldness, and encouragement
He had not only the power to preach but also the gift to present the gospel in a good, effective, prevailing, and brief way in a good order
In the second case, the case of the Samaritan believers in Acts 8, there is nothing concerning speaking in tongues
There is nothing mentioned by the Spirit about speaking in tongues, yet people saw that the Holy Spirit came down upon the saints
Shortly after he was saved a disciple a believer by the name of Ananias came to him and laid hands on him and Saul received the Holy Spirit
We have at least the two cases of the Samaritan believers and of Saul, in which the Scriptures do not mention speaking in tongues
At the time the people in that house were regenerated, they all received the Holy Spirit upon them, and they spoke in tongues
They received the Holy Spirit within as life, and at the same time they received the Holy Spirit without as power
When the apostle Paul came to them, he laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues
The Lord gives us the Holy Spirit first for regeneration, then for infilling, and then for power and gift, or simply stated, for baptism
On the one hand, we must be regenerated with the Spirit and filled with the Spirit, and on the other hand, we must be baptized in the Spirit
To be baptized in the Spirit means that we are not only filled with the Spirit, but we are absolutely in the Spirit
Similarly, as brothers and sisters we love the Lord, and we are concerned about the church, the saints, and the souls of others
If we would experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit, when we come to the meeting, we will have the power and the gift to pray
With all spiritual things-service, preaching, reading, and prayer-there is the need of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon us
We should forget about the different situations, different speakings, and different teachings in today's Christianity concerning this matter
We need the inward filling of the Spirit and also the outward filling, that is, the Holy Spirit as power with different kinds of gifts to us
One reason we must spend so much time to deal with this matter is that we need to see where speaking in tongues stands
Many people are careless in studying and understanding the Word simply because they are careless in their character
They are careless in all things and when they come to the Word to study and understand it they are still careless even to the utmost degree
At the start of this movement on the West Coast, they did not have speaking in tongues, but later tongues were brought in
From that time on, speaking in tongues has been a big problem among the Lord's children in this country, which has not yet been settled
Many insist on saying that speaking in tongues is the initial and necessary evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
Galatians 5 deals with the Spirit as life within us, while 1 Corinthians 12 deals with the Spirit as power upon us
Verse 22 speaks not of the fruits of the Spirit but of the fruit, singular in number and with the singular verb is
These nine aspects are the fruit of the Spirit as life within us; they are not aspects of the Spirit as power upon us
We must note, however, that these nine aspects are not all the aspects of the fruit of the Spirit as some teach today in Christianity
Since lowliness is omitted from Galatians 5, the nine items mentioned there are not all the items of the fruit of the Spirit
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
In addition, Matthew 5:5 and 9 speak of meekness and peace, while verse 6 speaks of righteousness, and verse 8 speaks of purity
According to the above verses, at least lowliness, godliness, righteousness, truth, holiness, and purity are not mentioned in Galatians 5
His intention is to tell us the difference between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit as life within us
If we read carefully, however, we can see that these are not nine fruits but nine of the aspects of the one fruit
The word of wisdom, for example, is not the manifestation of the Spirit but only one item of the manifestation
Of the five items mentioned in Mark 16, only two-speaking with new tongues and healing the sick-are included among the nine
The other three-casting out demons, picking up serpents, and drinking something deadly but not being harmed-are not included
People such as the Brethren and other fundamental Christians say that speaking in tongues is something devilish
They insist that this kind of miraculous gift ended with the apostolic times, so that today there is no more speaking in tongues
Corinthians 12 clearly says that it is one of nine aspects, and as we have seen, these nine are not all the aspects
Although the disciples on the day of Pentecost spoke in tongues, the prophecy of Joel mentions nothing about tongues
Even if those nine were all the items of the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues is only one of them
We may use the same grammatical construction to say, 'Last night at 7:30 we all came into the meeting and began to pray'
It is difficult to prove by verse 4 that all one hundred twenty disciples not only were filled with the Spirit but also spoke in tongues
Some of those places may have contained more than one dialect, but the number of dialects was probably still under thirty
All one hundred twenty disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, and many of them spoke in tongues, but probably not all did
We can be sure that they all were filled with the Holy Spirit, but we cannot be sure they all spoke in tongues
Should we believe that all twelve disciples did two things, both speak in tongues, on the one hand, and prophesy, on the other?
The logical understanding is that after receiving the Holy Spirit upon them some of the twelve spoke in tongues and some of them prophesied
Some speak in tongues as the evidence, or manifestation, of the Spirit, but others have a different manifestation
The Pentecostals say that all the early believers spoke in tongues but if they did there would have been no need for the apostle to say this
Those who have a Pentecostal background insist that everyone who has the baptism of the Holy Spirit must speak in tongues
When the people heard their voices and crowded around the disciples, the disciples began to speak actual dialects to them
There is no need to insist that speaking in tongues is the necessary and initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
If today we have the power of the Holy Spirit upon us, we may heal someone, but if we do not have the power, we cannot heal anyone
To cast out a demon by the power of the Holy Spirit today and to cast out another one next month is the same thing
We should not say that to cast out a demon is only our initial manifestation; later, we will continue to cast out demons
We will see that healing speaking in tongues and casting out demons are just some of the many items of the manifestation of the Holy Spirit
Because the Pentecostal believers insist that everyone must speak in tongues, they often force people to do it
They preach this matter they push it and they even teach people how to exercise their mouth to change their tone to speak in unknown tongues
In this country, some people teach others how to speak in tongues by exercising their mouth to change their tone of voice
As long as their speaking did not have the Chinese tone or the English tone, whatever came out would be speaking in tongues
When electricity comes into an appliance, there is no need for the various parts of the appliance to 'exercise to cooperate' in this way
Is it logical to understand that speaking in tongues is a necessary requirement for the evidence, or manifestation, of the Holy Spirit?
If we read portions of the Word such as Acts 19 in a careful way, we will find something different from these wrong teachings
Recently, many people on the West Coast of the United States have been brought to the Lord by this kind of movement
The great majority did not speak in tongues, but many were added to the Lord and are very much going on with the Lord
We conclude that there is no need to insist that speaking in tongues is the necessary and initial evidence of the Spirit
We need to be filled with the Spirit as life within, and we need to be clothed and empowered with the Spirit as power outwardly
At this point we are clear that the work of the Holy Spirit is of two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect
The way to receive the gospel of redemption and salvation is to repent, to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to be baptized in His name
The negative side is the remission, the forgiveness, of sins, and the positive side is the all-inclusive Holy Spirit as a gift to us
All the work of the Holy Spirit is included in the gospel, which we receive at the very moment we believe in the Lord Jesus
Because we do not know the proper way to preach the gospel, we have not seen many people saved through our preaching
If we know the proper way to preach the gospel, the Holy Spirit will honor this way and cause people to receive salvation
In order to preach the gospel we must preach the Lords death the Lords resurrection and the Lords ascension as the three steps of His work
Following this, we realize that Christ has resurrected, and by His resurrection He has imparted life to us through the Spirit of life
When they received this revelation and exercised living faith they received their first experience of the Holy Spirit being poured upon them
If we realize that all these are ours and we sense the need for them, we will apply them and enjoy them by faith
There is no need to pray that the Lord give us the Holy Spirit or pour Him out; He has been given and poured out already
All that remains is for us to realize what the Lord has accomplished to realize that the Holy Spirit has been given and to realize our need
The passions and lusts of the fallen person are the desires of the soul, the soulish life, related to the body
We need to be dealt with by the work of the cross so that we can give the ground, the room, to the Holy Spirit
Verse 24 speaks of the cross, and verse 25 speaks of the Spirit, saying, 'If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit'
We must ask Him to reveal to us the passions, desires, and other things of the soulish life we need to deal with
The only way to experience the infilling of the Holy Spirit is to be dealt with by the cross in the light of the Holy Spirit
When this sister prayed, she sensed that the Lord was demanding that she 'tear down the tower' on her head by cutting her hair
Eventually she made the decision to obey the Lord and cut her hair, and at that very moment she experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit
Before she was saved, a large chicken belonging to her neighbor wandered on to her farm, and she caught it and killed it
After a few years she was saved, and in the church there was much prayer for the experience of the power of the Holy Spirit
For many days whenever she knelt down to pray to the Lord for the power of the Holy Spirit, her prayer had no answer
If there is no struggle between us and the Lord, we may simply receive the experience of the Spirit by claiming it
Many people in the main hall stood up, but no one in the second room stood, although there were many people there
We must realize our need, consecrate ourselves, be obedient, and deal with the Lord until there is no struggle between us and the Lord
Day by day we apply the work of the cross to our natural life with the passions and desires related to the flesh
In the first step, the Holy Spirit comes in to regenerate us, and as the last step, the Holy Spirit comes upon us to be power
On the one hand, the Spirit is the Lord Himself to be life to us within, and since He is our Lord, we need to honor and obey Him
The Holy Spirit within us as life requires that we follow Him but the Holy Spirit upon us always follows us as the power under our direction
On one side, we obey the Lord and honor Him as the Lord, while on the other side, the Lord is under our direction for us to apply as power
We may not feel that we need to experience the Holy Spirit as power, but day by day we do need this experience
They may think that when they attend the meetings, they do not need power; they can simply go to sit, look, listen, and say 'amen'
We need power to contact others to fellowship with the saints to come to the meetings to listen to a message to pray and to praise the Lord
If we realize our need of life within and power without, day by day and moment by moment, we will claim it and apply it
We need to have the full experience of the indwelling of the Spirit and the full experience of the outpouring of the Spirit
May we pray in this way that we may be enabled to realize how much we need the Holy Spirit within and without, for life and for power
They should close their books and use more time to pray for the experience of the infilling and outpouring of the Holy Spirit
A certain unbelieving school teacher rode a bicycle past the meeting place and noticed a verse painted in large characters on the wall
The words and sentences of that prayer shook the heavens, shook the earth, shook the hearts, and shook the families
The shaking and prayer went on for more than half an hour with no repetitions but with different sentences and utterances
We have also received from others' experiences and even from the Pentecostal movement, and we have had our own experiences
They say that all the supernatural gifts and miraculous things are over and that there is no more divine healing or speaking in tongues
In the same way, whether the Brethren call what they experienced divine healing or something else, it is still some kind of divine healing
Although certain persons have realized that there is such a word in the Scriptures, they still insist that everyone must speak in tongues
They say that every believer in his or her private devotional time must have the anointing to speak in tongues
We cannot say that some are apostles only when the church comes together, but outside of the church gatherings they are not apostles
In the same way, if one has the anointing, the gift, to speak in tongues in the private hour, to be sure he will have it in the meetings
To say that we must speak in tongues creates trouble and causes many to be disappointed because they cannot obtain this gift
After speaking in tongues in a miraculous and supernatural way on the day of Pentecost, did the disciples doubt their speaking?
The reason a person doubts his speaking is that it seems even to him that it is not miraculous or supernatural
Although many people in that movement say that they speak in tongues, the tongue they speak in is something doubtful even to themselves
In chapters twelve and fourteen he indicates both that not all speak in tongues and that we should not forbid speaking in tongues
If so, we should be thankful and receive it, but if He would give us other aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit, we receive those
Some had speaking in tongues but not the power, while others did not have the speaking in tongues, but they had power
We must seek this with a sincere heart and pray more that we will experience the Holy Spirit more in the proper way
