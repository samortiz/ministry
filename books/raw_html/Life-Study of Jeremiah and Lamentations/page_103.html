<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah's Punishment<br>upon the Prophets of Judah<br>with the Priests and with the People</H2><P>Jeremiah 23 also shows us Jehovah's punishment upon the prophets of Judah with the priests and with the people. This punishment also is of five aspects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Making Their Way<br>like Slippery Paths to Them</H2><P>Jehovah will make their way like slippery paths to them. In the darkness they will be driven and fall in it. He will bring evil on them in the year of their punishment (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Feeding Them with Wormwood</H2><P>Jehovah will feed them with wormwood and will give them poisoned water to drink (v. 15a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jehovah's Wrath Going Forth<br>like the Storm Wind, Even a Whirling Tempest<br>Which Will Whirl Down<br>on the Head of the Wicked Prophet</H2><P>Jehovah's wrath will go forth like the storm wind, even a whirling tempest which will whirl down on the head of the wicked prophet. The anger of Jehovah will not turn back until it has executed and until it has accomplished the purposes of His heart (vv. 19-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Jehovah Being against the False Prophets</H2><P>Jehovah will be against the false prophets, who have perverted the words of the living God. He will punish them and their household (vv. 30-38).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Jehovah Utterly Forgetting Them<br>and Casting Away from His Presence Them<br>and the City Which He Gave to Them<br>and to Their Fathers</H2><P>Jehovah will utterly forget them and cast away from His presence them and the city which He gave to them and to their fathers. He will bring upon them eternal reproach and eternal humiliation, which will not be forgotten (vv. 39-40).</P>
