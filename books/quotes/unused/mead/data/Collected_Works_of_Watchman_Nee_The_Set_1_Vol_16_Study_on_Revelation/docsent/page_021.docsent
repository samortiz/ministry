   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Revelation 6:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"O Master, holy and true."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mr. Govett said that this was the way the Old Testament saints addressed the Lord, but in Revelation 3:7, the Lord Himself told the churches that He is holy and true.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, this is how the saints address the Lord throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Those who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such an expression is used many times in this book 8:13; 13:8, 12, 14; 14:6; 17:2, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means that the people who dwell on the earth have become settled in it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They have established themselves; everything they have is on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such men will be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 3:10 tells us that trial is about to come on the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The prayer in Revelation 6:10 is not like Stephen's; Stephen prayed for God's grace, while the martyrs in Revelation pray for the judgment on the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the prayer here is the prayer of the saints against the sinners: "Avenge our blood."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God does not forget the prayers of the afflicted Psa 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When God judges those who have persecuted the saints, He is avenging His martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>C. Revelation 6:11</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"And to each of them was given a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed, even as they were, is completed."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"A white robe" represents the righteousness which God imputes to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's justification of these persecuted ones is different from His justification of those who believed in the Lord for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The justification here is one in which God who sits on the throne announces the verdict of their victory in their appeal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All that is left to do is wait for God's execution of this verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Rest yet a little while."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This phrase can be used to prove that the church will not be raptured all at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word "until" means that there is still a very long persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the great massacre during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 7:13 through 15 speaks of political persecution, whereas 17:6 speaks of religious persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way the church takes is the way of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible shows us one thing here: in the first rapture there will be no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, the words "underneath the altar" imply that this is not the death of the sacrifice of sin offering, but that of the sacrifice of burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible never speaks of an altar of the sin offering; rather, it speaks of an altar of the burnt offering Exo 40:6, 10, 29; Lev 4:7, 10, 18; 1 Chron 6:49; 16:40; 21:29; 2 Chron 29:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What man sees first is the sin offering, but what God sees first is the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have no way of receiving life unless the Lord Jesus becomes the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, unless the Lord Jesus becomes the burnt offering offering everything to God, being obedient to Him, choosing His will, and even dying on the cross according to His will there is no way to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even Paul presented himself as a burnt offering Phil 2:17; 2 Tim 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His whole life was an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the martyrs will enter the kingdom as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Three kinds of people reign with Christ in Revelation 20:4:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1 "They sat upon them the thrones ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This refers to the overcomers in Revelation 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2 "The souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are the resurrected ones, referring to the martyrs in Revelation 6:9.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>3 "Those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This refers to the fellow slaves and their brothers in Revelation 6:11, who will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation 20:4 shows that they will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE SIXTH SEAL</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE SHAKING OF HEAVEN AND THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>REVELATION 6:12-17</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible records that when the Lord comes again, the changes in the heavens and the shaking of the earth will occur twice, once before the day of the Lord and once after the day of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, this will occur once before the great tribulation and once after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The verses in Joel 2:30-31 and 3:15-16 speak of what will happen before the great and terrible day, that is, what will happen before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Matthew 24:29 and 30 clearly describe what will happen immediately after the tribulation of those days.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the sixth seal is the situation before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Luke 21:11 also gives the situation before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first through fourth trumpets are calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fifth trumpet may be the beginning of the great tribulation, while the seventh trumpet is definitely the beginning of the great tribulation.</S>
