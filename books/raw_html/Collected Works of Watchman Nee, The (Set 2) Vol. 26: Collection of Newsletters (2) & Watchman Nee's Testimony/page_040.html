<h2 class="head1">RECENT NEWS FROM CH'ANG-CH'UN, MANCHURIA</h2><p>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Shun T'ien:</p><p>May the grace, peace, and strength of the Lord fill you.</p><p>Thank the Lord for His sweet will. He calls His children from hundreds of miles away in Feng T'ien and causes us to submit to the light of the truth. My first two months in Ch'ang-ch'un saw old opinions and prejudices blocking my heart and spirit; there was an indescribable bondage, and I felt much suffering. Looking back now, it was terrible. Thank God, He does not cast us away but gives us revelation in His Word to know our previous errors. It is very dangerous to live according to the feeling of the soul. He has also showed us that He does not want outward activity but inward submission to the small voice in our spirit; He wants us to do what He wants us to do. At the first table meeting, we could not help but submit to Him. The Lord is really among us! Therefore, we uttered cries of joy from our hearts and spirits and do not feel it is a bother to tell you. God's household now has one more obedient child, Brother Chao. We received different direction before, but God has given him extra revelation so that he is more clear and obeys the truth. Praise God, He is not a respecter of persons! We read the letter from you and Sister Chang after the table meeting. When we knew about the topic of the conference in Hangchow, we all simultaneously realized how very important and serious this matter was! In these last days God has allowed His children to see His will and to deal with Satan. We really praise the Lord! He is the Victor. If we stand in Him, we will also be overcomers.</p><p>I received your letter of the twenty-fourth on Monday. Brother Liu Wen did not come to the meeting on Tuesday because he had some affairs to take care of; he did not give it to me until Friday. I read it carefully. Thank the Lord for giving us the good news. We remember you often in our prayer. We believe that God will grace you. Tomorrow after the table meeting, we will ask each one to read the portion of the Scripture that God has asked us to read.</p><p>Now let me tell you a little about the current condition of the assembly. We read the letter from you and Sister Chang about the condition of the brothers in Shanghai and Hangchow, and we were really ashamed. We know even more that we are weak and do not live out the Lord's love. We can only pray before God that He would give us grace. If God can give this grace to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and Hangchow, He must also give it to us. After you left, this little flock of children was in fear and trembling before God asking Him to care for our meeting. We believe that our meeting is built upon the foundation of the Lord and that man cannot do anything. Therefore, every time that we meet, the Lord always sends His children to lead. Thank the Lord, in the last month and a half He has given us a quiet spirit so we could still meet. On Tuesdays and Fridays, there are not many people because it is too dark, but the Lord's Day morning meeting is still in the same condition. In the Lord's Day meetings we speak more about the aspect of salvation because there are outsiders. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>Thank the Lord, He has graced us in the past. We believe He will continue to care for us. We also believe that one of His servants will come to lead us. (We have given it to God.) All the brothers now realize that the one (you) we relied on before is no longer here! "Arise!"</p><p>We hope that the Lord will grace us. After Sister Chang and elderly Mr. T'ien return to Changchun, we would like to continue the fellowship meeting and the meeting to learn to sing hymns. Peace in the Lord! Greetings from all the brothers and sisters who meet in the Lord's name in Changchun.</p><p>Your member in the Lord,<br />Lo Ch'un P'u<br />November 3</p>
