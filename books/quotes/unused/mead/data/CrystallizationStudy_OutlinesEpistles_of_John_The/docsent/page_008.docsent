   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3-11; John 16:33.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To take God as our habitation, our eternal dwelling place, is the highest and fullest experience of God Psa 91.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To abide in Christ, taking Him as our dwelling place, and to allow Him to abide in us, taking us as His dwelling place, is to live in the reality of the universal incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with the redeemed and regenerated believers John 14:2, 10-11, 17, 20, 23: The New Jerusalem is the ultimate incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite church Rev 21:3, 22.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of the tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna; the way to be incorporated into this universal, divine-human incorporation, the mutual abode of God and man, is to eat Christ as the hidden manna v. 3; Exo 16:32-34; Heb 9:4; Rev 2:17.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we love the Lord, the more we shall have His presence, and the more we are in His presence, the more we shall enjoy all that He is to us; the Lord s recovery is a recovery of loving the Lord Jesus 1 Cor 2:9-10; Eph 6:24.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by caring for the inward teaching of the all-inclusive anointing 1 John 2:27: We abide in the divine fellowship with Christ by experiencing the cleansing of the Lord s blood and the application of the anointing Spirit to our inner being John 15:4-5; 1 John 1:5, 7; 2:20, 27.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as the Head is the anointed One and the anointing One, and we are His members enjoying Him as the inner anointing for the fulfillment of His purpose Heb 1:9; 3:14; 2 Cor 1:21-22.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The anointing, as the moving and working of the compound Spirit within us, anoints God into us so that we may be saturated with God, possess God, and understand the mind of God; the anointing communicates the mind of Christ as the Head of the Body to His members by the inner sense, the inner consciousness, of life Psa 133; 1 Cor 2:16; Rom 8:6, 27.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Head wants a member of the Body to move, He intimates it through the inner anointing, and as we yield to the anointing, life flows freely from the Head to us; if we resist the anointing, our relationship with the Head is interfered with, and the flow of life within us is stopped Col 2:19.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The teaching of the anointing of the Spirit has nothing to do with right or wrong; it is an inner sense of life Acts 16:6-7; 2 Cor 2:13.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our natural life is dealt with by the cross and if we submit to the headship of Christ and live the Body life, we will have the Spirit s anointing and enjoy the fellowship of the Body Eph 4:3-6, 15-16.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by switching on the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit Rom 8:2, 4: The Lord s abiding in us and our abiding in Him are altogether a matter of Him being the life-giving Spirit in our spirit; by the bountiful, immeasurable Spirit in our spirit, we know with full assurance that we and God are one and that we abide in each other 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; Phil 1:19; John 3:34; 1 John 3:24; 4:13.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way to abide in Christ as the empowering One so that He may be activated within us as the inner operating God, the law of the Spirit of life, is by rejoicing always, praying unceasingly, and giving thanks in everything Phil 4:13; 2:13; 1 Thes 5:16-18; Col 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by dealing with the constant word in the Scriptures, which is outside of us, and the present word as the Spirit, which is within us John 5:39-40; 6:63; 2 Cor 3:6; Rev 2:7: By the outward, written word we have the explanation, definition, and expression of the mysterious Lord, and by the inward, living word we have the experience of the abiding Christ and the presence of the practical Lord Eph 5:26; 6:17-18.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we abide in the Lord s constant and written word, His instant and living words will abide in us John 8:31; 15:7; 1 John 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We abide in Him and His words abide in us so that we may speak in Him and He may speak in us for the building of God into man and man into God John 15:7; 2 Cor 2:17; 13:3; 1 Cor 14:4b.</S>
