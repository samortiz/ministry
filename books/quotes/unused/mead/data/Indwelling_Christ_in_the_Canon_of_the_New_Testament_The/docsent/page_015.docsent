   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may feel that they know all of this already, but I am afraid that it is only a kind of doctrine to them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So many, including us, have come to know this doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there are not many who day by day, hour by hour, live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all know the doctrine, but very few live it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus told us in John 6:57, As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are such simple words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord said that He lived by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words are simple, but the effect is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To live by someone else s life is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All Christian wives know that the Bible teaches them to submit to their husband as their head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They must learn to live by their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This saying is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even a first-grader can say it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But to live it out is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe that all the sisters who are wives really love their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But how many of these sisters actually live by their husbands?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To love your husband is one thing, but to live by your husband is another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, there walked a person on this earth who said that He did not live by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He lived by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was living, but it was not Him but the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was living by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And He said, He that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that we all know this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But let me ask, in the past hour, by whom did you live?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are all familiar with Matthew and John, but not many Christians have gotten into the heart of these two books in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These Gospels show us that God intends to get into us to be our life and be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to do this, He first became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then He went to the cross, solving all negative problems.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this He was resurrected to become something so mysterious, so profound, and yet so real.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the life-giving Spirit, who is the very embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son today is the wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we call on Him, He comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the most simple thing, yet it is the most profound matter in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we call, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, the Triune God comes into us, mingles with us, and is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we call on His name, we are in Him, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not a superstition, but a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is just like the air that we breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are in the air, and the air is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we call, O Lord Jesus, we are in Him, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we read the whole New Testament, we see that God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He went to the cross to take away our sins, crucify our old nature, and terminate all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He solved everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After being put in a tomb for three days, He was resurrected to become a wonderful being the life-giving Spirit, the embodiment, reality, and realization of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we have this Spirit, we have the Son, Jesus Christ, and we have the Holy Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Triune God is realized by us in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever we call on Him, we are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Romans 10:8-9, Paul says, But what saith it: The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shall confess with thy mouth, Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both the Word and the Spirit are so nigh to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are even in our mouth and in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we will just exercise our heart and our mouth and say, Lord Jesus, immediately we are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem is that after calling on Him, we don t live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We still go back to our own ways and our own decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may even begin to talk about some of the brothers and sisters in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After we call on Him, we forget to live by the One on whom we call.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what Christians are short of today, and this is what we are short of.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are short of living by this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must all learn to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This must not simply be a doctrine to us; it must be our experience day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Matthew tells us that we have all been baptized into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that we were baptized into Christ and into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then John tells us that this Triune God has been processed into us just as water, food, and breath.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Abide in me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing John 15:4a, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To abide in Him means that we have been put into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>And to let Him abide in us means that He is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, it is just as the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 2:20, I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have been terminated and buried in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now it is no more us, but Christ that lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have been put into Him, and now He is within us.</S>
