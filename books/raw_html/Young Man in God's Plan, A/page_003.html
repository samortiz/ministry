<P>From the time of creation God has always been going on. He has a plan, and with this plan He has an aim, a goal. In order to reach this goal He has to go on and on. With every step of the Lord's going on, there is always something new. With people like Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David there was always a new step of the Lord's going on. It is hard for God to go on with older ones because they tend to be set, settled, and occupied. It is much easier for God to do something revolutionary with young people, to turn the age from one direction to another direction.</P><P>Do you think that God is satisfied with the present situation of Christianity? Do you not think that the present religious system is something too old? Do you not believe that God is waiting for a chance to do something new, to have a change, to have a transfer, to have a turn in the age? The record of the Scriptures shows us many changes. There was a change in history with Noah, with Abraham, with Moses, with David, and with Isaiah. Then there was a great change, a great turn with John the Baptist. Finally the greatest turn, the greatest change, in the history of mankind was brought in by a young man named Jesus when He was thirty years old. Then the Lord proceeded to go on further in His heavenly ministry with the apostles.</P><P>Throughout the history of the church we can see how the Lord raised up young men to turn the age. The Lord raised up Martin Luther during the reformation to bring mankind out of the dark ages. This was a transfer in the age. God is always doing something new. He is always going on. Generally speaking, God does not impart something new through the aged persons, but always through young persons. Martin Luther was young when he was called and dealt with by the Lord. Zinzendorf was a young man when he was caught by the Lord as was John Nelson Darby, the leader of the Brethren assemblies. John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield were also young men when they were called by the Lord. Missionaries that the Lord used in church history to gospelize the world, such as Hudson Taylor, William Carey, and David Livingstone, were called by the Lord when they were young.</P><P>It is hard to find a case from the Scriptures or from church history where God called an older person to do something for Him in a new way. This is because every piece of God's work is something new. God is always going on, so He always needs a new start with a new nature in a new way and for a new age. Man is so central in God's plan, yet man must be used by God while he is still young. When you become old, the time for God's calling, the time for God's use, mostly is over. I do not mean that the time for God's salvation is over. Many older persons have been saved by God, but the time for God's use is mostly over.</P>
