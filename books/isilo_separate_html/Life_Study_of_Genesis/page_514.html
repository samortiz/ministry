Another deep hurt was the defilement of Jacob's concubine by Reuben (v. 22). This also was a heart-touching and heart-rending experience. Verse 22 contains the very significant words, "And Israel heard it." You may wonder how such an immoral deed could have taken place in this godly family. Nevertheless, it happened.</P><P>The defilement of Jacob's concubine by Reuben caused the birthright to be changed (1 Chron. 5:1; Gen. 48:22). Reuben, born of Leah, was the firstborn. Actually and practically as the firstborn son he was the one to inherit the birthright. But due to the fact that he defiled Jacob's concubine, he lost his birthright, and the birthright was given to Joseph.</P><P>After the relationship between Jacob and Rachel had been fully dealt with, one of their sons was given the birthright. This is very meaningful. Deep in Jacob's heart, he felt that Rachel, not Leah, was his wife. Therefore, according to Jacob, the firstborn should not have been Reuben, but Joseph. Although it was of God that Reuben was the firstborn, it was not according to the desire of Jacob's heart. God had sovereignly caused Jacob to marry Leah and to bring forth Reuben. However, Jacob's heart was set on Rachel and Joseph. In his eyes, Joseph was truly the firstborn. God is fair. Having forced Jacob to marry Leah and to bring forth the firstborn through her, He eventually loosed His hand and let Reuben go. Reuben fell, and the birthright was adjusted.</P><P>This should come as a comfort to you. You may be concerned about God's dealing so thoroughly with your natural choice, with the desire of your heart. But God will eventually act to adjust the situation. By the loss of Rachel Jacob gained a second son who typified Christ, and by the defilement caused by Reuben the birthright was adjusted. We should not be troubled by what happens to us. Rather, we all must believe that everything is under the sovereign hand of God. The defilement of Jacob's concubine by Reuben was shameful, but even such a shameful thing was used to bring a positive result. The birthright should not have gone to Reuben, but according to natural birth he did possess it. Thus, in His sovereignty, God allowed Reuben to fall that the birthright might be transferred to the proper person. How marvelous this is! However, never use God's sovereignty as an excuse to say, "Let us do evil that good may come."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>7) Entering into Fellowship</H2><P>After experiencing these deeper and more personal dealings, Jacob entered into full fellowship with the Lord at Hebron (v. 27). The fellowship at Hebron means intimacy, peace, satisfaction, and joy. It is wonderful to be in the church life. However, at the beginning of our experience in the church life, we do not have full fellowship. This fellowship is at Hebron. Many who are in the church life today are not in a spiritual situation that is intimate, peaceful, satisfying, and joyful. Although you are in the church life, you still need to journey on, passing through deeper and more personal dealings until you come to Hebron and enter into full fellowship with the Lord. In this fellowship you will have complete joy, satisfaction, peace, and intimacy between you and the Lord.</P><P>Verse 27 says, "And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto Kiriath-arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned." Abraham had come to Shechem (12:6), had passed through Bethel (12:8), and had dwelt in Hebron (13:18; 18:1), and Isaac spent nearly his whole life in Hebron. Jacob, therefore, followed Abraham's footsteps to come to Shechem (33:18), to pass through Bethel (35:6), and to dwell in Hebron. We all need to come to Hebron. Although we are in the church life, we do not have rest, full peace, satisfaction, joy, and intimacy until we journey onward in our spirit to Hebron. Here in Hebron we enjoy wonderful intimacy with the Lord. Hebron is also the place where we mature in life. In 37:1, Jacob began to mature because he was in Hebron.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>8) Released from the Tie with His Father</H2><P>In verses 28 and 29 we are told of the death of Isaac. When Jacob was at Hebron, his last earthly tie, the tie with his father, was cut. Some may say, "We all must honor our parents. Why would you say that the tie was cut when Jacob's father died?" On the one hand, it is good to have our parents with us, but on the other hand, every relationship is a tie. After Jacob came to Hebron and entered into full rest, God took away his father and set him completely free from every earthly tie. At the end of chapter thirty-five we see a person completely transformed and set free. Jacob is now in Hebron, in full rest, joy, satisfaction, intimacy, and fellowship with the Lord. At Hebron there is nothing between Jacob and the Lord. Here he can sing, "Nothing between, Lord, nothing between." In Jacob we see a person thoroughly dealt with by God and wholly adjusted by Him. Every tie has been cut and he is fully free to enjoy intimate fellowship with the Lord in Hebron.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_513.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_515.html">Next</a> </body></html>
