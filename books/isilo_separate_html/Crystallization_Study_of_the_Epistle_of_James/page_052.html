The Standard of Such a Christian Perfection</H2><P>The standard of such a Christian perfection is much higher than the standard of that stressed by James, which resembles the kind of perfection in the Old Testament on the lower level of God's Old Testament revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SCRIPTURE BEING GOD'S BREATHING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. All Scripture Being God-breathed</H2><P>Second Timothy 3:16a says, "All Scripture is God-breathed," that is, written by the breathing of God, through the inspiration of the Spirit of God, indicating clearly that all the sixty-six books of the Holy Scripture are written through the inspiration of the Spirit of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Every Word Written<br>through the Spirit of God Being the Word of God</H2><P>The entire Scripture is written by inspiration of the Spirit of God, but this does not mean that every word written through the Spirit of God as a portion of the Holy Scripture is the word of God. Many portions of the Holy Scripture are rather the words spoken by persons (including Satan) other than God. I would like to present seven evident illustrations to show this. Three are from the Old Testament. First, there is Satan's word in Genesis 3. Second, there are Job and his three friends plus Elihu in Job 3&#151;37. The third illustration from the Old Testament is the psalmists' natural sentiment. Three illustrations from the New Testament are concerning Peter, and the fourth one is concerning James.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Serpent's Word Recorded by Moses</H2><P>Genesis 3:1b, 4-5 is the word spoken by the old serpent, the devil, but recorded by Moses through the inspiration of the Spirit of God for God's purpose to expose His enemy Satan's subtle deceiving and his devilish temptation that mankind may know that Satan is a real deceiver and devilish tempter (1 Tim. 2:14; Matt. 4:1-3; 6:13; 1 Thes. 3:5). Satan's word is recorded in the Bible, and that record is by the inspiration of the Spirit, but the word recorded is not the word of God. The serpent said, "Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?..Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil" (Gen. 3:1b, 4-5). This is Satan's word, but it is recorded by Moses as a part of the Holy Scripture. This shows that not every word recorded in the Bible is the word of God, but the record is by the inspiration of the Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
