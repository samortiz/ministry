   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE NEED OF THE SPREADING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND RESTORATION Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:15-16; Acts 8:27-37; Heb 5:11-12; 9:1-10; 2 Tim 2:15; 2 Pet 3:15-16</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter one we saw the recent changes in the world situation and the need of an appropriate direction for the Lord s move in His recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we want to see the need of the spreading of the divine truths for the Lord s recovery and restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope that our hearts would be touched through this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some Christians may refer to the need of the spreading of the gospel, but in this chapter I want to stress the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible unveils to us not only the gospel in a narrow sense but also the entire divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the gospel includes all the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are called the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They cover many things which are altogether neglected and missed in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I say the divine truths, I am referring to the New Testament economy of God, which is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul called his entire sixteen-chapter Epistle to the Romans the gospel of God 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gospel of God in Romans does not include merely the truth concerning justification by faith in the first four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It also includes the Body of Christ in chapter twelve and the local churches in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the local churches are included in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the church, where is the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to my experience, the gospel would be very deficient and poor without the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the entire New Testament is the gospel, from the first page of Matthew through the last page of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Testament as the gospel is typified by the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we may say that the gospel actually includes the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has spoken in the Bible, and He is still speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible is a record of God s speaking in the past, but God has not stopped speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is still speaking today in His Son Heb 1:2 , and His Son is speaking in His servants, the members of His Body cf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 Cor 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His speaking in His servants is God s gospel, which includes all the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God does everything by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genesis 1 shows that God s speaking was His work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God said, Let there be light: and there was light v. 3 . Speaking is God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 5:25 the Lord said, Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This refers to those who are dead in spirit, according to Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, to live in this verse means to be alive in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows that even salvation is carried out by God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our preaching comes from God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not preach our word but His word for Him to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He spoke, the old creation came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He speaks, the new creation, the believers in Christ, comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hebrews 1:1 says that God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, God is still speaking in every member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every member of the Body is a mouthpiece through whom God can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why 1 Corinthians 14:31 says that we can all prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word all in this verse includes the sisters also 1 Cor 11:5; Acts 2:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As members of the Body of Christ, all of us can speak for the Lord and should speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord s recovery spreads through those who speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the early 1960s, the Lord s recovery came to the United States through the divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has surely spoken in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The greatest thing produced among mankind is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although God has spoken in the Bible, man does not understand what He has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>About thirty years ago when I came to the United States, I began to speak about the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wherever I spoke concerning this, people told me that they had never heard that they had a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God has spoken in the Bible that He created a spirit for man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man s spirit is as important for God as the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The heavens, the earth, and man are three important items in this universe, and the most crucial thing within man is man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a verse in the Bible, but who understands it?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Years ago many people told me that if I had not spoken about the human spirit, they would have never known that they had a spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First Thessalonians 5:23 strongly shows that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, not many teach the revelation of the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have spoken much concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The word economy is the Greek word oikonomia anglicized, which has been translated into dispensation or stewardship in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the book of Ephesians, this Greek word is used three times in 1:10; 3:2; and 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But outside of the Lord s recovery, who has taught, preached, or expounded the Bible on the truth of God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>People may teach husbands to love their wives, and wives to submit to their husbands, but who knows what God s economy and God s dispensing are?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This again shows that God has spoken in the Bible, but there is not much understanding of what God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many Christians know from the Bible that God is the unique God who created the universe and man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They know that men became fallen sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, God so loved the world that He sent His Son to save us through His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He shed His blood, and we are redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, who knows why we have been redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many think that we have been redeemed to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Very few know the purpose of our redemption according to the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even the word church, a translation of the Greek word ekklesia, has been misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many think that the church is a building with a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some teach people that since they are children of God, they should behave themselves so that they can please God, glorify God, and make God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If they do this, they will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Otherwise, they will suffer perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This teaching is absolutely false and unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Others in Christianity teach positive thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They proclaim that positive thinking will make people rich.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are also many teachings today concerning how to have a successful marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I am sharing these things to illustrate the lack of the divine truths today in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I am so burdened to see the truths of the Lord s recovery spread to the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Much of what is spoken in today s Christianity is superficial and even superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Millions of copies of the Bible have been sold, but who knows what the Bible speaks in its proper sense adequately?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, who knows what it means to worship in spirit and reality?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God has spoken in the Bible, but who understands what He has really spoken?</S>
