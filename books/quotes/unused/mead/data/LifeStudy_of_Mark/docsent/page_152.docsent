   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S UNIVERSAL SPREADING OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GOSPEL THROUGH HIS DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the Slave-Savior s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples, 16:20 says, But those went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the accompanying signs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This preaching of God s gospel to all the creation v. 15 by the resurrected and ascended Slave-Savior, as the Slave of God, through His believers, began from Jerusalem and has been proceeding to the uttermost part of the earth Acts 1:8 continuously and universally for the past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It will continue to proceed until the Slave-Savior comes to set up the kingdom of God on earth Luke 19:12; Dan 7:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Preaching Everywhere</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 16:15 the Lord said to His disciples, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then verse 20 tells us that they went out and preached everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that we also should go forth to tell the nations, and even all the creation, of the wonderful Slave-Savior, His all-inclusive death, and His marvelous resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Gospel Preachers</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that in chapter one of the Gospel of Mark there was only one preacher of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when we come to the end of this Gospel, there are many preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who can say how many gospel preachers there are today?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the preaching in chapter one of Mark was mainly to the Jews, but the preaching at the end of chapter sixteen is to all the creation, that is, at least to all the different peoples on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to preach the gospel to all the creation, we may need to be beside ourselves in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have never been zealous in preaching the gospel to all kinds of peoples, this may mean that you may have never been beside yourself in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the day I was saved I was called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I knew that it was my destiny to preach the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, my understanding at the time was that I would preach Him in the villages of my homeland.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now I am in this country preaching the Lord to those from every continent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Oh, let us tell everyone about the wonderful Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us tell all people about the Lord s all-inclusive death and marvelous resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us not be silent; let us preach the gospel, present the truth, and minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>for the Producing of the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Having passed through the Gospel of Mark, we may say that we have experienced the different kinds of healings: the healings of our ears, tongue, and eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we are qualified to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that through this Life-study of Mark we all shall be ushered into Christ as our entire, universal, all-inclusive replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we shall be able to testify with Paul, It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having experienced Christ as our replacement, we then shall be able to speak forth to all the nations concerning Him and His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We thank the Lord for giving us the clear vision that this age is for the producing of the new man through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All things the world situation, international affairs, the economy, industry, education, and even wars are for this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Revelation 6, the first of the four horses is the white horse of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the white horse is taking the lead, and the other horses are following.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gospel preaching must take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This age is for the preaching of the gospel to produce the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now that we have seen this vision, let us go forth to preach Christ to all the creation!</S>
