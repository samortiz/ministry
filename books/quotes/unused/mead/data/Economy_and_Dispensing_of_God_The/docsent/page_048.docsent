   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Producing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the church is produced as God's masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Greek the word for masterpiece is poema, which means a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is used in reference to a piece of work that expresses one's wisdom and skill to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this sense, even a woodcarving can be considered a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God's eyes, the church is His marvelous masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before we were saved, we all were "naughty" ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one could change us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But one day someone came to us and charged us to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time we did not understand very well who the Lord Jesus is, but we believed in the Lord, called on His name, and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through such an experience we all were changed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a mystery; no one can explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All we can say is that we became God's masterpiece, a new man in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is a new man in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nothing other than the divine dispensing of the divine life can make us new.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dispensing of the divine life in the preaching of the gospel is like the giving of an injection to a patient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A nurse does not need to explain very much to a patient; she only needs to inject the medicine into the patient's arm.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, the divine life is not dispensed to others through their understanding of Bible teachings, but through the injection of the divine life in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By such a dispensing, something is infused into others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By Enlivening Us, the Sinners</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who Were Dead in Sins, and Raising Us Up through Christ's Life-imparting Resurrection,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dispensing His Life and Element into Our Being</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is produced by the enlivening of sinners through this divine dispensing Eph 2:1-6a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever a person is baptized, he is put into Christ, and at that moment Christ comes into such a one to enliven him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although he may not understand very much, he is enlivened by this living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the preaching of the gospel, Christ is infused into his being, and he is made alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is altogether a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By Seating Us in the Heavenlies</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>through Christ's Ascension,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>in Our Organic Union with Him</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>in the Dispensing of His Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Ephesians 2 we are told that the believers are first enlivened and then seated with Christ in the heavenlies v. 6b . After a person is enlivened by Christ in His resurrection, he may have the realization that he is in the heavens with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Christ's resurrection we are lifted up to the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the real experience of Christ's resurrection with His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these are the results of the dispensing of His enlivening life.</S>
