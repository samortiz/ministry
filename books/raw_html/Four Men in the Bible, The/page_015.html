<h1 class="title">THE SIMPLE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 9, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4-6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND MAN<br />
AS REVEALED IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The content of the Bible is altogether a matter of the Spirit of God and our human spirit. God created man as a vessel so that He could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and nature for His expression. Therefore, God created a human spirit within man as an organ to receive Him (Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1). However, because of the fall of man, the spirit of man was deadened (Gen. 3:3; Eph. 2:1). Later, human culture, religion, and various philosophies emerged so that man&rsquo;s thoughts and concepts deviated from God&rsquo;s intention, bringing in many complications within man.</p>
<p>The biblical revelation regarding the relationship between God and man is actually quite simple. God is Spirit (John 4:24), and He created man as a vessel to contain Him by creating a human spirit within man (Rom. 9:23-24). God created a spirit within man because He, as the divine Spirit, desires to enter into man&rsquo;s spirit to be his life and nature. This simple relationship, however, became quite complicated because the fall of man filled man&rsquo;s mind with many distractions so that he cannot clearly see that God is Spirit, that man is a vessel to contain God, and that the human spirit is an organ and a vessel to receive God. Man, however, can still cry out to God and call on His name so that God can enter into his human spirit to be his life. This is regeneration.</p>
<p>To be regenerated means to be born again, which is to gain another life, the life of God, in addition to man&rsquo;s original life. The original life we received is the human life, but the life we receive through regeneration is the life of God. The life of God is divine and eternal; it is God Himself, and it is also the Spirit of God. We cannot separate the life of God from God; neither can we separate the life of God from the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>God is Spirit, and the Spirit is the Spirit of life (8:2). When God&rsquo;s life enters into our spirit, we receive another life, and we are regenerated. Regeneration is the issue of our believing in the Lord Jesus. We were fallen sinners, but God was incarnated to be a man, the Lord Jesus. As our Savior, Jesus accomplished redemption for us on the cross. God became a man in order to bear our sins on the cross, solving the problem of our sins before God. Hence, in order to be regenerated, we must believe in the Lord Jesus, who died for us and who redeemed us from our sins on the cross. When we believe in Him, His redemption is applied to us, and we are forgiven because His precious blood washes us of all our iniquities before our righteous God. Following His redemptive death, Jesus was resurrected from the dead and became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). His death dealt with man&rsquo;s sins, and in His resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, He can enter into man to be his life through regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3). Man needs to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus so that his sins can be forgiven. Then he needs to open to the Lord and call upon Him so that He can enter man&rsquo;s spirit to be his life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE LIVING LORD</h2>
<p>We need to follow the living Lord after our regeneration. Consider an example of a brother who was a criminal before hearing the gospel and believing in the Lord Jesus. First, his sins have been forgiven because of the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross. Second, the Lord entered into him as the omnipresent life-giving Spirit when he called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name. Not only were his sins forgiven, but the Lord&rsquo;s life also entered into his spirit. However, even though he has been regenerated with the Lord&rsquo;s life, he can still be tempted by the devil to do evil things and to think indecent thoughts in his mind. Nevertheless, deep within his spirit, there is an indescribable feeling that troubles him when he is tempted. This is the operation of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of life, in him. After a man calls upon the name of the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit enters into him, and even though he can be tempted to do evil and improper things, he no longer feels comfortable within when he does such things. This is because the Lord is living within him.</p>
<p>Before they were saved, all Christians had a certain sense of comfort with their sinful behavior. However, after believing into the Lord and calling upon His name, there is an additional sense, a feeling, within them that is real, even though it is almost indescribable. Previously, some believers were expert liars who could easily tell clever lies and be inwardly pleased with themselves. However, once they called on the Lord Jesus and received the Lord, it was difficult for them to lie. Some enjoyed watching movies very much, but the same sense of enjoyment was no longer present when they went to a movie. Ever since they called on the Lord, the Lord within them troubles them and makes them uneasy, because He is living and has no desire to go to a movie. This troubling proves that there is another person with another life in them. This is the operation of the Lord Jesus within a genuine Christian. Jesus, as the living Spirit, has entered into us and become our life. We have been born of the Spirit. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Jesus, as the living Spirit, is operating in us and troubling us so that we would follow Him. This is the mark of a genuine Christian.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is a very simple matter of following the Lord who lives within us. The Lord is the life-giving Spirit. As He stirs up things within us, He causes us to deal with our sins. Hence, we need to thoroughly confess our sins; the more thorough and more specific our confession is, the better it is. The more we confess our sins, the more the Lord will give us a sense of our sins. Then the more we have a sense of our sins, the more we can confess our sins so that our inner being will be fully occupied and filled with Him. When we call on His name, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and confess our sins before Him, our sins will be dealt with, and our inner being will be occupied and saturated with the Lord little by little. Furthermore, we will spontaneously enjoy the Lord and sense His presence, sweetness, and riches. The Lord will become our life, power, light, and holiness. We need to daily experience the Lord in this way and be filled with Him.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
