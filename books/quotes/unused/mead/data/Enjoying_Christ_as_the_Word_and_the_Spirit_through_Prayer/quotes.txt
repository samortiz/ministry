[1]  Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer CONTENTS
[2]  The Bible reveals that God is our enjoyment and that all the riches of God, what God is in His fullness, are the riches of Christ Eph 3:8, 19b .
[3]  The reality of Christ is the Spirit, who is the Spirit of reality John 14:17 , and all that Christ is, that is, all the riches of Christ, are revealed in the Word 1:1 .
[4]  Therefore, in order to know the riches of Christ, we have to know the Word, which is the revelation of all that Christ is.
[5]  In the four Gospels the disciples received the Word, but they did not yet receive the Spirit.
[6]  The four Gospels were written by the early disciples based on what they had read of Christ as the living Word.
[7]  First they read something of the Lord, and then they put what they had read into writing for us to read.
[8]  Some of what the disciples read of the Lord was His spoken words, but some of what they read were the living, walk, and acts of the Lord Jesus.
[9]  If we simply study the word in the way taught by seminaries, for example, we will enjoy the Lord mainly as knowledge in the mind, although by His mercy we may unconsciously enjoy Him a little as the Spirit.
[10]  After we know Him as the Word, we need Him to be transferred into the Spirit that we may not only know Him but also experience Him.
[11]  However, when we come to the book of Acts and the Epistles, we see the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22 , not mainly for us to know but to partake of, taste, enjoy, and experience.
[12]  Of the two passages in these sister books, one tells us that when we are filled with the word, we praise the Lord with psalms, hymns, and songs, while the other says that when we are filled in spirit, we praise with psalms, hymns, and songs.
[13]  The Epistles emphasize that we need to pray more than we need to read.
[14]  First Thessalonians 5:16 through 20 says, Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
[15]  If we respect what we have heard in the ministry of the word, we will pray about it and pray with it.
[16]  AS THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 6:57, 63; 2 Cor 3:6b
[17]  THREE KINDS OF SEEKERS OF CHRIST The Fundamentalists, Seeking Christ
[18]  Although we may have been Christians for many years, we have mostly known Christ only as the Word.
[19]  Therefore, we must know how to transfer the word we have understood into the Spirit.
[20]  The proper reading of the word helps us to realize the Lord, enjoy Him, experience Him, and live by Him, and it also helps us to exercise our spirit, because in this way we pray much.
[21]  Prayer: Lord, under Your precious blood we come again to You.
[22]  The more we practice to exercise our spirit to pray with the word we read, the more we will be adjusted and learn how to do it.
[23]  We must take the word as truth, not merely as knowledge, and realize that the word must be transferred into the Spirit.
[24]  When we read this, we may pray in a brief way with a strong spirit to take the Lord s promise: Lord, I take Your word as a promise to me.
[25]  When we read this, again we may pray, Lord, I do not know what Moab is, but I know that the city in which I presently live can be like Moab.
[26]  CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST AS THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT TO BE ENJOYED BY US Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14, 18; 14:16-20; Acts 9:4; Rom 8:9-11; 1 Cor 6:17; 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 4:7; 13:5; Gal 1:16; 2:20; 4:19; 6:18; Eph 3:16-17; Phil 1:19; Col 1:27; 3:4, 11; Rev 2:1, 7, 8, 11; 5:6; 22:1-2
[27]  We need to have a full view of the Lord Jesus as the Word and as the Spirit.
[28]  The four Gospels are a full record, picture, and revelation of the Lord Jesus as the expression of God, the Word of God for us to read, see, and understand John 1:1, 14, 18 .
[29]  In order to know who and what the Lord Jesus is, we have to spend time to study the four Gospels.
[30]  Apparently there is no verse in the Acts that tells us that Christ was in Peter, John, James, or Stephen.
[31]  The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.
[32]  This is also a strong proof that we have a human spirit and that Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit, so that we can be one spirit with Him.
[33]  CHAPTER SIX EATING THE WORD BY READING AND PRAYING Scripture Reading: Col 3:16; Eph 5:18-20; Matt 4:4; Jer 15:16; Exo 30:7-8 THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
[34]  Colossians 3:16 says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
[35]  Verse 17 continues, And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
[36]  According to the context of these verses, we first have the word as the means to convey Christ to us, and we enjoy Him to such an extent that we are filled with Him.
[37]  God s intention is to give Himself to us as our enjoyment in Christ through the Spirit.
[38]  Therefore, we have to know how to enjoy Christ.
[39]  Regardless of how many messages we give people and of how good those messages are, if those who hear them do not know how to eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and feast on the Lord, the messages will not work for them.
[40]  While we read and consider, we speak something to the Lord, and while we are speaking something to the Lord, we ponder on the word and consider what we understand.
[41]  Ten minutes before dinner is served, we can come to the word to read and pray.
[42]  By the time dinner comes, we already will have had a good meal, eating the word and feeding on the Lord.
[43]  Sometimes we may read the word in the garden or in the car, sometimes we may sit to read and speak to the Lord, and at other times we may have to kneel down to read and speak to the Lord.
[44]  We simply should contact the Lord by talking with Him in a very spontaneous way, yet in the spirit, to absorb Him by reading and praying, that is, by talking to the Lord based on what we have read and understood.
[45]  As we practice to take the word in this way, we should learn to pray not merely from our knowledge but by exercising our spirit to say something from within to the Lord, to have a real contact with the Lord.
[46]  Then when we come to a passage like Luke 21, we will see the vision of the presence of the Lord, and we will pray, Lord, in whatever I do, grant me the mercy and grace that I would do it in the sense of Your presence.
[47]  CHAPTER SEVEN ENJOYING CHRIST THROUGH PRAYER Scripture Reading: Rev 5:8; 8:3-4; Rom 8:26; Psa 27:4, 8
[48]  Revelation 5:8 says, And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints.
[49]  Romans 8:26 says, Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[50]  Even though we know not for what we should pray, the Spirit intercedes within us and for us, many times with unutterable groanings.
[51]  When we are speaking intimately to those who are close to us, we do not compose something in a formal way, yet many of us do not pray and talk to the Lord intimately.
[52]  In order to learn how to enjoy Christ by praying, we must drop the old way of prayer.
[53]  Also, we should not pray for business affairs or personal concerns.
[54]  Instead, pray to praise Him, to adore Him, to thank Him, to behold His beauty, and to inhale Him.
[55]  Many times we have to pray by groaning, saying, O Lord, O Lord....
[56]  The real prayer is the Spirit, who is Christ Himself, working and moving within us, that we would open to Him to breathe Him out and breathe Him in see Hymns, #255 .
[57]  If we do not pray, we have Christ within us, but we do not have Him as the incense ascending to God.
[58]  After we have spent twenty or twenty-five minutes to enjoy the Lord by dealing with His word, we need a time simply to pray.
[59]  We should keep nothing in mind and simply seek His face, open ourselves, behold Him, look to Him, and speak something about Him, about His goodness and beauty, to adore and worship Him.
[60]  At first, some may begin their prayer by saying, Lord, I confess that I do not know how to enjoy You or praise You in this way.
[61]  We may realize that the Lord is sweet, so we can pray, O Lord, You are so sweet!
[62]  If we see a building on fire, we would not say to our neighbor, My dear friend, you must know that there is a fire close by.
[63]  If we reduce our composing, we will have more expression, and when we have more expression, we will have the riches not of composition but of the items of the Lord.
[64]  In this message we will consider the proper way to enjoy the Lord, partake of Him, and intercede by expressing His burden in prayer.
[65]  These verses say, And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.
[66]  The proper prayer is a prayer in which we enjoy the Lord, drinking and inhaling Him into us.
[67]  This is the first thing we should do when we come to pray.
[68]  If anything frustrates us from praying in this way, we must realize that there is something wrong between us and the Lord and deal with it by confessing.
[69]  If we are open to the Lord, the Holy Spirit will give us the sense that we are wrong in certain things, and we should follow that sense to confess our wrongdoings and apply the Lord s blood.
[70]  If after this we still have the sense that something is frustrating us, yet we do not know what it is, we should ask the Lord to cover us and cleanse us concerning whatever it is with His precious blood.
[71]  After we have inhaled the Lord and absorbed something of Him into us, what we have absorbed becomes a burden within us, and we express this burden in prayer.
[72]  Rather, we must first go to the Lord to deal with every frustrating and negative thing, and then we must absorb the Lord, enjoy Him, and take Him in. Then something of the Lord Himself within us will burden us to pray.
[73]  Then we have to contact the Lord by faith to praise Him, look to Him, appreciate Him, adore Him, behold His beauty, and stay in His presence for a certain time to praise Him and speak something concerning Him.
[74]  We will have the burden in prayer to express something of the Lord, and we can inquire of the Lord whether or not that is His burden, just as Abraham became burdened with the Lord s desire concerning Lot and prayed while conversing and consulting with the Lord.
[75]  When we pray to adore the Lord and praise Him, we have to learn to drop the natural and religious thought.
[76]  When we praise and adore the Lord, we need to drop our natural thought, concept, and feeling and speak something heavenly, spiritual, new, full of life, full of the anointing, and full of the sweetness of the Lord.
[77]  Whenever we come to pray, we must not bring our old things to the Lord.
