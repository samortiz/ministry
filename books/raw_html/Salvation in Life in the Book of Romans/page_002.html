<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>REDEMPTION IN CHRIST‘S DEATH AND SAVING IN HIS LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:1-4, 17; 3:22-24; 5:10</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The subject of Romans—the gospel of God—Rom. 1:1-4:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Promised by God in the holy Scriptures—v. 2.</li>	<li>Concerning the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord—v. 3a:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>According to the flesh—humanity, coming out of the seed of David—v. 3b.</li>		<li>According to the Spirit of holiness—divinity, designated the Son of God in power out of the resurrection of the dead—v. 4.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Explaining clearly that the just shall have life and live by faith—Rom. 1:17:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The just—the one whom God justifies, to whom God has given His righteousness—Rom. 3:22-24.</li>		<li>Out of faith—taking faith as the principle; righteousness being God’s righteousness, which is out of God; faith being our faith, which is of us.</li>		<li>Shall have life and live—receiving the eternal life of God and living by this life of God.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>Christ’s death and His life—Rom. 5:10:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>We being reconciled to God through the death of Christ—including being redeemed and justified—Rom. 3:24.</li>	<li>We being saved in the life of Christ—the complete and full saving of God in Christ.</li>	<li>These two becoming the gospel of God—the complete and full salvation of God.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Tonight, I will do a new thing which I have never done before. I will cover three messages in one evening. Furthermore, I will cover ten messages in three evenings. The main subject of these ten messages is salvation in life from the book of Romans. My purpose in giving these ten messages is twofold: First, I desire that you would receive help. Then, as you return to the gospel outreach localities, you can help the new ones message after message with the help you have received.<p>These messages contain an unprecedented understanding concerning the book of Romans which has never been found in Christianity. Though the way this understanding is presented is particular, it is not peculiar. These messages contain new light that we have received from the Lord. Because others have not seen these things before, they are new. They are rare and wonderful because no one has ever seen them. Hence, these ten messages are all new, fresh, and wonderful.
