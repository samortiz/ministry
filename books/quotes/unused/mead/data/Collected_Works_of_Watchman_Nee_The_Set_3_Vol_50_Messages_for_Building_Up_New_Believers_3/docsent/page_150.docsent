   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Salvation Coming to This House</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can this be settled in an instant?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One must not presume that God is able for no reason at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord shows us two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, Zaccheus was a son of Abraham; second, salvation came to his house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Zaccheus did not do this by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was not because of Zaccheus himself that he heard the Lord's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did not weep and pray repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not bargain with himself in numerous attempts to get through and then grit his teeth and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not give in a little one day, a little the next day, a little more the third day, until he no longer held anything back.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said that it was not Zaccheus's decision, struggle, consideration, or endeavor that made him willing to sell all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why was his house, which had been built up through years of savings, gambles, and sacrifice of honor, stripped bare in an instant?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was "bankrupted" in an instant because salvation came to his house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Zaccheus did not save himself; the Lord saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Salvation has come to this house!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's power has come to this house!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When this happens, everything moves speedily and promptly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please notice the two occurrences of the word house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 5 the Lord said, "I must stay in your house," and in verse 9 He said, "Today salvation has come to this house."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This clearly shows that the Lord is the very salvation that came to Zaccheus's house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord comes to our house, salvation comes to our house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's coming is salvation's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once He comes, everything becomes possible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The young ruler, in effect, said that God could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Zaccheus, in effect, said that God could do it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No man can be freed from the bondage of money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man will always turn away in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when God shows mercy to a person and saves him, nothing becomes impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. The Lord Seeking Those Who Are Lost in Riches</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the end the Lord concluded, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" Luke 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a very familiar verse in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One chief reason that the Son of Man came is to seek those who are lost in riches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All those who love money are lost and estranged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the Lord is seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Zaccheus was found by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the Lord has also found us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Originally we were all lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were lost in money.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the Lord has found us, and all of our problems can go away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once money leaves, all our problems go away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>GOD'S WAY TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consider these two chapters, Luke 18 and 19.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord told the young ruler to sell all he had, and he went away in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Lord did not say anything to Zaccheus, yet something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord was on earth, He initiated this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the church came into existence at Pentecost, this matter was practiced again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a church is proper, all of these things will happen without much struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A. Selling Everything Being the Lord's Command</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The main thing we should note in Acts 2 and 4 is that the believers had all things in common at the beginning of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one said that he kept something as his own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In other words, the Lord's hand was on every saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once a man received eternal life, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Among the ones who had this life, their sphere of possessions began to be diffused; their possessions began to move away from their private hands.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The next thing we find is that men spontaneously sold their properties and houses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In chapter four the believers sold all their properties and houses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the way the Lord wants us to take.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His commandment is that we should sell our all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>B. All Ordinary Possessions</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Being Held in Common</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before a man follows the Lord, he carries many things with him, such as his assets and daily necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once he comes to the Lord and the Lord touches him, his possessions become common goods.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From that point on, no one can say that a certain object belongs to him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No one can say that he is taking advantage of anyone else, and no one can say that anything is his own.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The same object will be shared by all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The same money can be in your pocket, or it can be in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The same clothes can be worn by you, or they can be worn by me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whatever our practice is, this should be the kind of flavor we carry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such a practice has to do with one's ordinary possessions.</S>
