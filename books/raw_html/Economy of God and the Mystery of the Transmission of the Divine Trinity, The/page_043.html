<h2 class=head2>Christ Making His Home in Our Hearts through Faith That We May Be Rooted and Grounded in Love</h2><p>Paul used the word that repeatedly in Ephesians 3; he used it four times in verses 16-19 alone. The first time he used it is in verse 16 when he prayed that the Father would grant us “to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.” The second time, in verse 17a, he said, “That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.” The third time, in verses 17b-19a, he said, “That you…may be full of strength to apprehend…and to know the…love of Christ.” The fourth time, in verse 19b, he said, “That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.” In these verses the word that may also be translated as in order that, meaning that the second that is the result of the first that, the third that is the result of the second that, and so forth.<p>Verse 17 says, “That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love.” This is the result of our being strengthened into the inner man (v. 16). What does it mean for Christ to make home? Making home has a deeper meaning than staying in a certain place; it does not merely mean to stay somewhere but to settle down there. Christ is in you, but He may be like a guest merely sitting in a chair, leaning against the wall, or standing in the corner. However, once your whole being is strengthened into your spirit, He has the ground and the right to settle down and make home in you. For example, suppose I am moving to a new house, but the original owner will not vacate the house. If this is the case, I will not know where to put my furniture; the most I can do is to put it in the living room. Not until the house is empty will I be able to unpack and put everything in order, thus, making home and settling down there.<p>Has Christ settled down and made His home in us? Sometimes He is at home within us but sometimes He is not, because we often struggle with Him. When we are joyful, we may pray, “Lord, I love You.” However, we should not think that we have prayed well and that this is enough, because when we struggle with Him, we may not love Him anymore. Sometimes when we struggle with the Lord, we may even force Him into a corner. Although He comes back again a few days later, we do not have peace in our spirit because we always have this kind of struggle within. Before we were saved, we may have seemed to be at peace all the time. If we wanted to scold someone, we would just do it, and we were very happy after doing it; we were free to do whatever our heart dictated. But after we became a Christian, even the thought of blaming others, let alone scolding them, causes us to have no peace within, because it interrupts the Lord’s making His home in us. Once He is prevented from making His home in us, He does not have peace, and we also do not have peace.<p>In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus said, “Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” When I was young, even before I was saved, I had already heard this word being preached, and I also loved to preach it to people. Now when I think back, I realize that I simply did not know what I was talking about. The only way for you to genuinely receive rest from the Lord is to let Him make His home in you. If you do not let the Lord make His home in you, it will not be possible for you to find rest. The rest which the Lord gives is His making home in you. If you let Him settle down in you peacefully, you will be blessed. However, today among thousands and millions of Christians, it is rare to find one or two who are willing to let the Lord make His home and settle down in them.<p>In order to let the Lord make His home and settle down in us, we need both faith and love (1 Tim. 1:14). Through faith we apprehend Christ, and through love we enjoy Christ. However, neither faith nor love is from us; both are from Christ. For this reason, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. In this way, His faith becomes our faith, enabling us to believe Him, and His love becomes our love, enabling us to love Him. When we are rooted and grounded in Christ’s love, we grow in life and are built up in His life.
