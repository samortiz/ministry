After he begot Ishmael, there was a thirteen-year period in which God did not speak to him (Gen. 16:16&mdash;17:1). Although he begot a son, he wasted thirteen years. This is the experience of many Christians. Whenever we act according to the flesh, God puts us aside and allows us to eat the fruit of our flesh. In God's eyes that period of time is a total waste.</p><p>After Abraham begot Ishmael, during the long period of thirteen years, there was no peace in his family. However, the Bible does not show us that Abraham had any regret. On the contrary, he treasured Ishmael very much. We can see this from his word to the Lord: "O that Ishmael might live before thee!" (17:18). Although chapter fifteen tells us that he believed, there does not seem to have been too much pursuing on his part. Day after day, he still took satisfaction in Ishmael. According to our thought, if a man has been walking according to the flesh for thirteen years and still has no feeling of guilt, there must not be much hope for him. But we must remember that Abraham was called by God. God had a purpose in him which He had to fulfill; He could not give him up. Although he backslid for thirteen years and although God did not speak to him during all that time, He was working all the time. God does not give up those whom He has chosen. If He wants to gain a person, that person cannot escape His hand. Even though Abraham had failed, God still came and looked for him. We have to realize that no fleshly pursuit, struggle, fretting, or unrest will bring us forward. We should learn to commit ourselves to the hand of the Almighty. He will lead us as He sees fit.</p><h2 class="head3">God Making a Covenant with Abraham</h2><p>After thirteen years, Abraham was ninety-nine years of age and was becoming old. He considered his own body as being already dead. Even if he wanted to have a son, he could no longer do it. Then God appeared to him and said, "I am the Almighty God" (17:1). This was the first time that God revealed His name as "the Almighty God." The name Almighty God in the original language can be translated as "all-sufficient God." After God revealed this name to him, He put a demand on him. "Walk before me, and be thou perfect." Although Abraham had believed that God is powerful, he might not have believed that God is all-sufficient. This was why he tried to do things by himself. God showed him that if he believed in God as the all-sufficient One, he had to walk before Him as a perfect man. Being perfect is being pure. God required Abraham to be pure and without any mixture.</p><p>After God showed this to Abraham, He said, "I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly....My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee....And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God" (vv. 2-8). God wanted to gain a people through Abraham, and God wanted to be their God.</p><p>What kind of a standing should Abraham and God's people take before they can become His people? God said, "This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised" (v. 10). In other words, God wants a people, yet they must not have any fleshly activity, power, or strength. Who then are the people of God? They are those who have been circumcised. Circumcision is the mark of God's people. Those who were eight days old, whether they were born in the house or bought with money of any stranger had to be circumcised (v. 12). It was not enough to be born, and it was not enough to be bought. One had to be circumcised as well. We are all born of God and bought by God. As far as redemption is concerned, we were bought by God. As far as life is concerned, we were born of God. But if we are not circumcised, we will have no part in the testimony of the people of God. God told Abraham, "The uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people" (v. 14). Those who were not circumcised were to be cut off from among God's people. This has to do with the testimony. It means that those who are not circumcised cannot be vessels for God's testimony. A man may be redeemed and have life, but if he is not circumcised, and if he does not know the flesh-dealing cross, he cannot be of God's people; he still has to be cut off from the people.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 35: The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
