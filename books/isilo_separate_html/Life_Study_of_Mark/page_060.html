We need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord did not speak of these things in a careless way. On the contrary, knowing man&rsquo;s inward situation, He speaks in a careful way of what proceeds out of man&rsquo;s heart. First come the evil reasonings and then fornications. This indicates that the evil reasonings are related to fornication.</p><p>The third item in verse 21 is &ldquo;thefts.&rdquo; Some may claim that they have never stolen anything. In fact, everyone has committed theft in one way or other. Actually, fornication itself is a kind of theft, for it is a matter of obtaining something improperly. To steal is to take something illegally. In principle, fornication is in this category. Fornication is a matter of following an illegal course, a course not ordained by God. Anything that is taken illegally is a matter not only of theft but also in the principle of fornication.</p><p>Although we are saved ones, children of God, our fallen nature, including our old heart, is still with us. In particular, the two evil things&mdash;fornication and theft&mdash;are crouching behind us, waiting for an opportunity to ruin us. Throughout the centuries, many Christians, including pastors and ministers, have fallen into the snare of fornication. Even many of those who love the Lord Jesus have been caught in this way. Many have disregarded the fact that their heart is evil. As a result, they failed to keep a proper distance from the opposite sex and fell into fornication.</p><p>In a real sense, the church life is a social life. Males and females often have contact with one another. Because of the danger of fornication, we need to keep ourselves at a proper distance from the opposite sex.</p><p>I wish to emphasize the fact that even though we have been regenerated, according to the teaching of the New Testament, our old nature remains with us. We should never forget this fact. Until our body has been redeemed, transfigured, our fallen nature will be with us. No matter how holy you may be, you need to realize that you still have your fallen nature. This is the reason I advise the saints not to be in a room alone with a member of the opposite sex.</p><p>I appreciate and respect this country very much. Nevertheless, I am bothered by the fact that males and females are too free in their contact with one another. Many women are not aware of the danger of being defiled. If they had such a consciousness, they would keep themselves at a proper distance from the opposite sex.</p><p>As we have indicated, in our preaching of the gospel we need to touch the condition of man&rsquo;s heart. In particular, we need to expose the fact that in principle all fallen people are fornicators and thieves. When I was preaching the gospel in China, I often used to say, &ldquo;You ladies and gentlemen appear to be very nice. But suppose I could take an x-ray picture of what you are inside. If I did this, you would not have the boldness to remain here. You know that you are evil inside and unclean. Perhaps even as you are listening to this message, you are reasoning concerning evil things. You have the appearance of a lady or gentleman, but in your inward condition you are filthy.&rdquo; It is a fact that evil reasonings proceed out of man&rsquo;s heart, and these reasonings are related to fornication and theft.</p><p>It is very significant that in chapter seven of Mark the Slave-Savior in His gospel service touches the inward condition of man. We should remember that the Lord&rsquo;s word in 7:21-23 is a word uttered not to the crowd but to His intimate followers. It seems that here the Lord is saying, &ldquo;Peter, John, James&mdash;you all need to realize that out from your hearts proceed evil reasonings, fornications, and thefts.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">Murders and Adulteries</h2><p>The next item mentioned by the Lord as proceeding out of man&rsquo;s heart is murder. Many murders are committed for the sake of fornication or theft. Fornication and theft often issue in murder.</p><p>Next, the Lord goes on to speak of adulteries. There is a difference between adultery and fornication. If a married person commits sin with another married person, that is adultery. But if an unmarried person commits sin with another unmarried one, that is fornication. Here the Lord speaks concerning both fornication and adultery.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
