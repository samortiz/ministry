   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Once we were busy planning; now we quietly trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once we were often grieved and anxious; now we are like a weaned child resting in the bosom of the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we were full of our own ideas, having many desires and ambitions; now we only consider the will of God to be good and thus rest in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Truly, it is "perfect submission, perfect delight."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we completely give ourselves to the Lord, all things are peaceful and tranquil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 6:6 has a similar message: "But as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not as before, relying on the soul that is, self-relying to follow the will of God; rather, it is from the soul, to wholeheartedly, truly follow the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now, through the working of the cross, the soul-life that formerly rebelled against the will of God completely surrenders to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Previously, we were merely on the outside, and if we were not carrying out our own affairs according to our own will, then we were doing God's will according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now however, we are one with God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A soul governed by the Holy Spirit is not concerned for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Do not be anxious for your life soul " Matt 6:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now what we seek first is the kingdom of God and His righteousness, believing that God will take care of our daily needs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The soul-life has been dealt with through the cross by the Holy Spirit, so it can no longer be anxious for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Self-consciousness is the primary manifestation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the believer has truly been in God and has lost the self, he can fully trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Self-love, self-planning, and self-care all works of the soul have now been removed in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, one no longer makes his own plans for these kinds of practical issues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because the cross has done its work, we no longer busily plan for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Previously, we worried, but now, since knowing God, we can peacefully seek His kingdom and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we care for what God cares about, God will care for what we care about.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Previously, miracles were rare and strange to us; now we live in the God who performs miracles, knowing He will provide every need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not by exercising the mind but by resting in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the power of God serves as our backing, questions concerning our daily life such as eating and drinking become very insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator" 1 Pet 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes people in the world only know God as the Creator and do not know Him as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The believers, however, not only know Him as the Father but also know Him as the Lord of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To speak of Him as the Lord of creation is to make His power known, to make known how the whole universe is under His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before, when we were suffering, we were afraid of man, but now we know that everything is in His hand and has His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before, it was difficult to believe that none of the things in this world can move against His will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we know that everything in the universe, whether of man, the natural, or supernatural, is in His careful and wise arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we know that everything that comes upon us is permitted and predestinated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A soul governed by the Holy Spirit is a peaceful, quiet, and committing soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only should we commit our soul to the Lord, but we should also love and long for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"My soul pursues after You" Psa 63:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we no longer dare to have faith in ourselves, to be independent, or to serve the Lord according to the whims of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now, the One whom we follow is the Lord, and we very carefully, even with fear, follow hard after the Lord, not daring to leave Him for one moment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Someone translated this verse, "My soul is glued unto thee."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we do not act alone but completely surrender to the Lord, not reluctantly but willingly with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now what we hate is the life of our self, and the One whom we completely love and long for is the Lord.</S>
