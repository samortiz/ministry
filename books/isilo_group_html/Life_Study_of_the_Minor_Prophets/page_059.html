JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENT ON NINEVEH</h2>
<p>The remainder of the book of Nahum (1:8&mdash;3:19) speaks of Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Nineveh. Here Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on this evil city is fully portrayed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Verdict<br />
concerning Nineveh&rsquo;s Destruction<br />
by the Medes and Babylonians</h2>
<p>First, the Judge pronounces His verdict concerning Nineveh&rsquo;s destruction by the Medes and Babylonians in 612 B.C. (1:8-12a, 14). Verse 8 says that when the time comes, God would use an overflowing flood to make a full end of her place. Chapter two shows us this flood. Nineveh was built on the Tigris River and was completely surrounded by water. This was a protection to Nineveh. Then in 612 B.C. the Medes and the Babylonians came together to attack Nineveh, and they found a way to open the gates of the river and they flooded the city (2:6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Promise of Comfort to Judah</h2>
<p>In 1:12b-13, 15 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s promise of comfort to Judah. In verse 13 He says, &ldquo;Now I will break his yoke from off you / And will snap your bonds asunder.&rdquo; &ldquo;His yoke&rdquo; refers to the yoke which Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, had placed on Israel. First, the Assyrians came to devastate Israel. Then God used Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the Assyrians, and this became a kind of deliverance to Israel.</p>
<p>Verse 15a goes on to say, &ldquo;Behold, upon the mountains / The feet of him who bears the glad news, / Who announces peace!&rdquo; This refers to the announcement of Assyria&rsquo;s defeat by the Babylonians and was a word of comfort to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. A Vision of the Destruction of Nineveh</h2>
<p>Nahum 2:1-13 presents a vision of the destruction of Nineveh.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Swift Activity<br />
of the Babylonian Armies to Destroy Nineveh</h2>
<p>Verses 1 through 4 describe the swift activity of the Babylonian armies to destroy Nineveh. The Babylonians were used by God for this purpose. Thus, verse 3 says, &ldquo;The shield of His mighty men is red; / The valiant men are clad in scarlet; / The chariots flash with the shining of steel / In the day of His preparation, / And the spears are brandished.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Way of the King of Assyria and His Queen<br />
to Encounter the Babylonian Attack</h2>
<p>Verses 5 through 7 speak of the way of the king of Assyria and his queen to encounter the Babylonian attack.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Babylonian Armies&rsquo; Plunder of the Wealth<br />
and Their Slaughter of the People of Nineveh</h2>
<p>Verses 8 through 13 record the Babylonian armies&rsquo; plunder of the wealth of the people of Nineveh and their slaughter of the people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Restoration of the Excellency of Israel</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For Jehovah restores / The excellency of Jacob / As the excellency of Israel&rdquo; (v. 2a). This indicates that the destruction of Nineveh is for the restoration of the excellency of Israel. God used the Babylonians with the Medes to invade Assyria and thereby to save Israel from the tyranny of the Assyrians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Devastation of the People of Nineveh</h2>
<p>At the very beginning of chapter three, Nahum, speaking about Nineveh, says, &ldquo;Woe to the bloody city! / She is all full of lies and pillage; / The prey does not depart&rdquo; (v. 1). The chapter goes on to describe in detail the devastation of the people of Nineveh (vv. 2-17). Significantly, verse 17 mentions locusts. &ldquo;Your princes are like the locust swarm, / And your officials are like hordes of locusts, / Which camp in the hedges / On a cold day, / But when the sun arises, they flee away, / And the place where they are is unknown.&rdquo; This indicates that the Assyrians also were locusts devastating Israel. These Assyrian locusts were eventually defeated by the Babylonian locusts.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Miserable End of the King of Assyria</h2>
<p>Nahum concludes his prophecy with a word concerning the miserable end of the king of Assyria (vv. 18-19).</p>
<p>The main point of the book of Nahum is that while God was chastising Israel and punishing the nations, He always did what was necessary to preserve Israel for the purpose of manifesting Christ. God&rsquo;s wonderful preserving act was carried out by the locusts. God used one kind of locust to deal with another kind of locust in order to preserve Israel. God&rsquo;s purpose in preserving Israel is to bring forth Christ.</p>
<p>Although this book does not say anything about Christ directly and does not refer to Christ, the goal is still the manifestation of Christ. The preserving of Israel is for the purpose that Christ might have a channel&mdash;the reserved and preserved Israel&mdash;through which to be brought forth. Regarding this, all the minor prophets are one, and the book of Nahum is just one small link on the chain of their revelation. Thus, once again we see that, according to the minor prophets, God&rsquo;s chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations are for the manifestation of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of the Minor Prophets &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
