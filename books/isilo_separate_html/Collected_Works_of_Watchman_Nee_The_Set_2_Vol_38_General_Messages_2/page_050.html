These matters concern: (1) the protection of the Body, (2) the restriction of the Body, and (3) the supply of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROTECTION OF THE BODY</h2><p>The church is the Body of Christ, and every Christian is a member of this Body. The Body not only supplies all the members but protects them as well. Protection by the Body is very crucial for the members in spiritual warfare. God's children suffer the devil's attack because they are too individualistic and do not have the protection of the Body. It is foolish as well as dangerous for anyone to expose his head or exhibit himself in days of warfare. Such ones do not come under the sheltering of the Body, and they afford Satan the opportunity to attack them. Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter but the work of the church. Ephesians is on the Body of Christ. Chapter one speaks of the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies that God has given us; the result is that we see the power of the resurrection of His Son. At the same time, chapter one also shows us that the Lord Jesus is the Head of the church and that the church is the Body of Christ, the vessel which contains Him. The Christ who fills all in all also fills the church. This is why the church is exceedingly rich. Chapter two speaks of how the church is produced. Although the church is rich, it should not forget its former condition. It attains its position of riches through the saving grace of God. Chapter three is on the mystery of God, which created one new man from the Gentiles and the Jews. Chapter four is on God's building of the Body and how the Body grows. Chapter five is on the church as the Body of Christ and how we should be restricted by this Body. Chapter six is on the armor of the Body. In 6:11 "you" is plural, which means that the whole armor of God is not for individuals. This special armor is for the Body. Every member has his particular function, and when these functions are put together, we have the whole armor of God, and we can engage in spiritual warfare.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the spiritual armor is for the church, not for individuals. You cannot deal with Satan alone; you need the church to deal with him. Other members can see what you cannot see as an individual. Other members can garrison what you cannot garrison as an individual. Satan is not afraid when you pray alone, but when a few come together to pray, Satan will tremble. Some are outstanding in their faith, and they have the shield for protection. Others are particularly gifted with God's word, and they have the sword of the Spirit. When they exercise their sword and speak God's word, you receive help. Spiritual warfare is a corporate warfare; it cannot be fought by individuals alone. If you go to battle alone, Satan's attention will be directed toward you as an individual, and he will attack you as an individual. Those who do not see the Body think that they can do everything and that they are everything. These are the ones who are most likely to fail. It is easy for a single tree to be blown down by the wind, but it is not easy for a whole forest to be blown down by the wind. Satan is seeking for those without any covering and is concentrating his attacks on these isolated and independent ones. Whoever is under the covering of the Body is under protection. One of the functions of the Body is protection. Those who are under the protection of the Body will not suffer Satan's attacks. If a man is not under the protection of the Body, he will live as if the church does not exist; he will not see the Body of Christ. If he does not encounter assaults, nothing will happen; but the minute he faces an assault, he will fall. The experience of many Christians testifies to this fact. A certain brother was physically weak because he was an individual in the Lord's eyes; he did not have the protection of the Body of Christ, and he came under the attack of Satan while he was trusting and boasting in himself. Brothers and sisters, it is extremely dangerous to expose ourselves; it is very precarious to put our trust and confidence in ourselves. A battle in the physical world requires protection, and a battle in the spiritual world also requires protection. If a brother does anything independently, even though he is a good brother, he will be setting his own trap! Many spiritual defeats and failures happen when a person is alone and does not have the covering of the Body. Brothers and sisters, we are only members in the Body, and we cannot go on without the protection of the other brothers and sisters. Even Moses' hands needed the support of Aaron and Hur (Exo. 17:12). If Moses needed support from other members, how much more do we need support!</p><p>The gates of Hades cannot overcome the church. The Lord Jesus said, "The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18). The gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. The Lord Jesus never said that God's children can be independent and leave the church. Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter but a matter in the Body. If we want to have protection, we have to be among the brothers and sisters. Never think that we can go to war alone; this only invites trouble. However, unless we are dealt with in our natural life, we cannot put our trust in the brothers. If the natural life is not dealt with, a man is not only incapable of trusting in God, but he is incapable of trusting in the brothers as well. No stubborn or self-trusting person can walk in the footsteps of his brothers. God is after those who know themselves. He is after those who find their protection among the brothers. The vessel God is after is the whole Body. We are only members in the Body; this is why we need the help of the Body. Those who cannot be joined to the brothers and sisters, who do whatever they want and go wherever they want, will surely end up in failure. Is there no brother or sister they can fellowship with? Is there no brother or sister they can pray with? Brothers and sisters, whenever we do not have the Body, we do not have any protection, and we fall into trouble. A battle in the physical world requires covering. Throwing away one's own covering when covering is needed is a tactical mistake; such a risk will bring in nothing but death. The same is true with spiritual warfare. Brothers and sisters, if we do not have any protection and have not encountered any danger, we can only say that God has been merciful to us; we cannot say that we comprehend spiritual tactics.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
