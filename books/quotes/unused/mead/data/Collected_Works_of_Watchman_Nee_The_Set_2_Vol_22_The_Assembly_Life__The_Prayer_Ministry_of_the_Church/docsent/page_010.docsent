   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The elders express opinions and make judgments on various matters.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only the elders can express their opinion concerning certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No brother can stand up in the meeting at will to express his opinion concerning what to believe and what not to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If any brother does such a thing, he is overturning the authority of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, only the elders have the authority to judge, utter declarations or announcements that are directed toward the public, and make judgments concerning disputes in truths; this is not the work of ordinary brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An ordinary believer can only speak on his own behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>An elder can speak on behalf of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because he is under the Head and is speaking on behalf of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This relates to the order in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3 The elders manage the matters and meetings related to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, we see only brothers as elders; we do not see sisters as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The place God has assigned for the sisters is to be under someone's ruling; they do not have a place in ruling over others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God does not allow women to manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible, there are deacons and deaconesses, but there are no female elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that in managing the affairs of the church, God wants the man to be the head of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the sisters should learn to submit by the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there are some among the sisters who can serve others, they can do the work of this service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if anything needs to be decided, the decisions should be made by those who are responsible as the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, if some among the sisters want to be baptized or be received for the bread breaking meeting, the sisters can testify for them, but the final decision rests with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some sisters may have the gifts and may be respected by other brothers and sisters, but the question of position and authority is more important in the Bible than the question of gift, and the question of God's truth is more important than the question of ability.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose the sisters would like to have a sisters' meeting at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sisters can express their opinion and check with the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the brothers think that this is proper, they will not stop it and will allow the sisters to meet accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the sisters do this, they are not acting independently but properly and in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that their meetings are not private meetings but meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why do the sisters have to follow this procedure?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason is that the sisters tend to be emotional and are easily deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The elders are there to protect the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If everything concerning the church is decided by the brothers, the sisters will be protected and preserved in their covered position, and they will avoid many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every problem that arises is corporate in nature and is not the problem of an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders have a responsibility to properly oversee the matters related to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While the sisters are standing on the ground of submission through submission to Christ's authority, the elders should not shun their responsibility through fear of offending the sisters or of arousing suspicion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, there are limits to the authority of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we must not forget that Barak was before Deborah and became the head covering to Deborah see Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>4:4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>4 The elders should manage the matters related to the church meetings and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The elders should control and forbid errors that may arise in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, in the meeting, some brothers may stand up to say some improper words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who do not have the gift of teaching desire to speak many times; it seems as if they are addicted to preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who have the gifts, on the other hand, do not like to speak and would rather hide themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when the elders notice that men who are not suitable to conduct Bible study or to preach are trying to do these things, they should stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If some brothers pray, preach, or give announcements in an improper way, the elders should notify them after the meeting, explain their mistakes to them, and forbid them from doing similar things again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the elders do not do this, these brothers will go on with their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may think that you should be patient with these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the weaker ones will not be able to stand them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, you have to take up the responsibility to notify them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please understand that there is not a strict organization among us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even when believers who have not left the denominations request to be received, we receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our door is wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone in the denominations who is saved can come and break bread with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose that some of them purposely try to entice some of our brothers and sisters to join them in their Bible study in their homes, after breaking bread with us, or suppose that they gather some of the brothers and sisters who are meeting with us to listen to their opinionated doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When this happens, the church will be divided through their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever things of this nature occur, any brother or sister should report it to the "elders."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must wait until the responsible brothers announce in the meeting that certain people will have meetings in their homes before we can all go.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, these kinds of meetings in the homes should not be held.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not mean that we have no personal liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we should submit to God's authority and control and enjoy the liberty of the limitations of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our familiarity with certain persons often brings in leaven through conversations with them, and a sect is formed which endangers the whole lump.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the brothers have to pay attention to this matter, learn to submit to authority, and not do things that the elders have not endorsed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>5 The elders make decisions concerning the Lord's Day meeting and write letters of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether the Lord's Day meeting should be held in the morning or in the afternoon is a matter to be decided by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The writing of a letter of recommendation is also not something that every brother can do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes, you may write a letter recommending a person to the brothers in another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, only letters written by the elders can represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This shows once again that the elders represent the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They are responsible for overseeing the church and keeping the church from trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the elders have to learn to serve properly and exercise their authority properly, while the brothers have to learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>6 The elders are the patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After the elders are appointed and acknowledged, they should be respected by the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the same time, the elders themselves should take up their responsibility with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They should consider themselves as having no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible tells us these two aspects of the truth in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To the brothers and sisters, the elders represent God's authority, and everyone should submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But to the elders themselves, they have no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After hearing about the authority of the elders, are we not afraid that the elders may misuse their authority?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What would happen if they began to lord it over us?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But God tells the elders, "Therefore the elders among you...shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock" 1 Pet 5:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The elders do not have any authority in themselves; they only have the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you are in Christ, understand God's heart, and are able to tell others about God's heart, you are the true authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The elders should not lord it over the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They should be careful to submit to God's authority and be a pattern to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only then can they demonstrate their authority to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the one hand, the brothers should submit to Christ's authority, which the elders represent.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>On the other hand, the elders themselves should realize that they have no authority in themselves and that they are there merely as patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Concerning the authority of the elders, please see the books of 1 Timothy, Titus, and Acts 20.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>7 Accusations against the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The books of Timothy tell us, "Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses" 1 Tim 5:19, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In this matter, we should pay attention to two points.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>First, there must be a written accusation; words from the mouth do not count because many times words alone are groundless and can easily be denied or changed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Second, there must be two or three witnesses; the testimony of one is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the Bible, two or three witnesses constitute the word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The apostles and those whom they have specifically assigned should be responsible for handling such accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I would draw your attention again to the fact that because there are no official apostles today, there are no official elders.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There is only a group of people who are doing a part of the work that the apostles did at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since they are responsible for appointing elders, they are also responsible for dealing with elders.</S>
