   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THE MINISTRY OF JUDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jude was surely a brother under God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Jude there is the matter of building up ourselves in the most holy faith v. 20 . What is faith? It is just the impartation of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all have to be built up in this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to be built up in the divine life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we can pray in the Holy Spirit and keep ourselves in the love of God as we await the mercy of our Lord v. 20b-21 . Here is the Trinity of the Godhead: the Holy Spirit, God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the holy faith we have the Trinity for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This enjoyment of the Trinity is just to partake of the divine dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually this is unto eternal life and will set us before His glory without blemish in exultation v. 24 . To be built up in the faith, to pray in the Holy Spirit, to keep ourselves in the love of God, to await the Lord s mercy, is altogether unto eternal life so that we may be set before God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates clearly that to get involved with the Trinity is to enjoy the dispensing of life which results unto eternal life and the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>IN THE MINISTRY OF JAMES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>James also has a few good points.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said that every good and perfect gift comes from the Father of lights 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also said that the Father of lights is the One who begot us by the Word of truth v. 18 according to His own will that we should be a kind of firstfruit of His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The firstfruit is surely something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among all the creatures we believers are the first ones to receive and enjoy divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because God has begotten us and we have the eternal life, we are the firstfruits of life among all the created items.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to respect and thank James because he told us something about God s life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To beget is to dispense life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When our human father begot us, he dispensed his life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Father of lights begot us, He dispensed His life into our being to make us a kind of firstfruit among His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the begetting for life dispensing.</S>
