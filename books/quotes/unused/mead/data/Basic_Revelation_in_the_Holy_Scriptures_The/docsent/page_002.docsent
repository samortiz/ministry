   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD S PLAN Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4, 5, 9-11; 3:2, 8-9, 11; Col 1:25; 1 Cor 9:17; 1 Pet 1:1-2; Rom 8:30; Gen 1:26a, 27; 2:7; Zech 12:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine revelation in the sixty-six books of the Bible is exceedingly profound.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are seven basic points to this profound revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first three points are God s plan, Christ s redemption, and the Spirit s application.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These three points involve the divine Trinity God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What God planned He has accomplished through Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What He has accomplished in Christ, He applies to us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last four points are the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the ultimate consummation the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this chapter we will cover the first item of the basic revelation in the Bible God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GOD S GOOD PLEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HIS HEART S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible clearly reveals God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most Christians treasure two books among Paul s writings Romans and Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans begins with our condition as sinners, fallen mankind, but Ephesians opens by bringing us into God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Romans 1 we can see our condition as sinners, but in Ephesians 1 we can see that there is something in the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The phrase good pleasure is used twice in this chapter vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has a good pleasure, and this good pleasure is His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In eternity past God was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot imagine what it was like in that past eternity, but Ephesians 1 tells us that before the creation of the universe God had a heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had a good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What He wanted can be expressed by the single word sonship 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sonship is God s heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After God made Adam, He said that it was not good for man to be alone Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This word can also be applied to God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not good for God to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had a desire to bring forth many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 1 tells us that God predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians may think that God s predestination is unto salvation; but according to Ephesians, in eternity past the first thought in God s heart was not salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His foremost thought was sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God foreknew that His creation would fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of the fall, there was the plan of salvation, so salvation was purposed for sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s desire is to bring forth many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Recently at a prayer meeting in Irving, Texas, I saw three young men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By looking at their faces, I could see that they were the sons of a certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The three of them bear a strong resemblance to their father; they are his very expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more sons a father has, the more expression he has.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 8:29 tells us that the only begotten Son of God became the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s only begotten Son in John 1:18 and 3:16 became through resurrection Acts 13:33 the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Firstborn implies that other sons followed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now God has not only one Son, but many.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The firstborn Son of God, Christ, has millions of brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Throughout these twenty centuries many have been regenerated and thus have become God s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these sons are the brothers of the firstborn Son of God John 20:17; Heb 2:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a great, vast sonship!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was a young man, I was with some saints who knew the Bible very well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They stressed God s predestination, but I never heard them say what the goal of God s predestination is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After many years of studying the Bible, I saw that we were predestinated unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Subconsciously I had thought that we were predestinated unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some would say that we were predestinated unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is neither salvation nor heaven which is the goal of God s predestination; it is sonship Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The King James Version translates this word the adoption of children, but the word in the original language means sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It does not mean children adopted by a father, but rather sons born directly of a begetting father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s heart s desire, then, is to have a vast multitude of sons who express Him, not only in this age but for eternity.</S>
