   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Unique Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The universal church is the unique Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Ephesians 1:22-23, Christ is the Head and the church is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ the Head has only one Body Eph 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is abnormal for a head to have more than one body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you saw a person with one head and two bodies, surely you would consider him a monster.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Christianity today, the unique Body of Christ has been divided into countless bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These bodies are the many so-called churches in existence around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the different churches claim that their Head is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the one Head, Christ, has many bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not only wrong, but this is grotesque!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the midst of today s abnormal situation, we strongly affirm that the Body of Christ is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is one Head and one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely this one Body cannot be a particular local church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This one Body must be the universal church, the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as the Head is unique, and the universal church as the Body is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Universal Church Comprising All the</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This one universal church, one Body, comprises all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There may be thousands of local churches, but together they constitute one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Each local church is only a part of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The universal church is the unique Body of Christ, and all the local churches are simply the local expressions of that one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The local churches all comprise the one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Acts 15:41 speaks of the churches in Syria and Cilicia, and Romans 16:4 mentions the churches in the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 8:1 speaks of the churches in the province of Macedonia; Galatians 1:2, of the churches in the province of Galatia; and Revelation 1:4, of the churches in the province of Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Revelation 1:4, there were at least seven local churches in the one province of Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament we can see many local churches, and together these local churches are considered as one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today in the Lord s recovery there are nearly six hundred local churches on six continents.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these local churches together are just one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE BELIEVERS LIVING IN THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The believers are living in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, we cannot live directly in the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is impossible for us to live in the universal church without living in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord is building up the universal church, and each of us is living practically in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Matthew 18:17 the Lord said that if, as a believer, you have a problem with another believer, you should tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely the church mentioned in this verse is not the universal church; it must be the church in the place where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are in Seoul and you have any problem, you should tell the problem to the church in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are in Pusan, you should go to the church in Pusan; if you are in Hong Kong, you should go to the church in Hong Kong; and if you are in New York, you should go to the church in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church to which you should tell your problem is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Local Churches Being the Local</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Expressions of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The local churches are the local expressions of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:27; Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is only one Body, but there are many expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Universally, all the churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of that universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A local church is not the Body; it is only a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a local expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church in Seoul is not the entire Body; it is a part of the entire Body as the Body s local expression.</S>
