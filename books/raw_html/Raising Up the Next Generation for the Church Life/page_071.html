        <h2 class="head2 alignleft">Excerpts from the Ministry:</h2>
<p>In order to do the children&rsquo;s work well, we need to pay attention to these three aspects: the teaching material, the training of the teachers, and the leading of the elders. After brothers are designated to compile material, the leading of the elders and the training of the teachers should follow. We must promote the children&rsquo;s work in every locality. The brothers should promote this work, and the sisters should carry it out. If all the saints are willing to receive this burden and not miss the opportunity, there will be a glorious result. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 314-315)</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING PRACTICAL LESSONS TO BUILD UP<br />
THE CHILDREN AS PROPER HUMAN BEINGS</h2>
<p>At the end of each lesson that we give them, we can impress them with a short verse from the Bible. By ministering the lesson, we will lay a good foundation for them to receive something brief from the word of God. We may tell them, for example, that as children they need to be proper human beings who behave in a good way to honor their parents. We can even use illustrations from nature; this will interest them very much. Then at the end we can read them Exodus 20:12, which says, &ldquo;Honor your father and your mother,&rdquo; explaining that this is the word of God in the Bible. We can ask them to keep it in mind, recite it, and explain to us what it means. In this way we will impress them with this word. Finally, at this point we can help them to pray with this verse in a very simple way. The next time they come together, we can have them tell us what they heard the previous week and whether they put it into practice. We may ask them in what way they honored their parents in the past week. If we take an adequate time to do this, they will be very interested in what we say. We must not give them anything in a premature way. Rather, we should prepare the lessons according to their age. We should give the five- and six-year-olds one thing and the seven- and eight-year-olds something else. Premature knowledge damages children. We need some brothers and sisters who understand this principle to prepare the lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HELPING THEM TO KNOW GOD,<br />
REDEMPTION, AND LIFE IN A PRACTICAL WAY</h2>
<p>Gradually, we can help them to know who God is, not in a religious way but in a very practical way. We can lead them to the point that they realize there is an almighty One, who is God. By choosing the best verses concerning God&mdash;such as Exodus 3:6, which says, &ldquo;I am the God of your father,&rdquo; or 20:2, which says, &ldquo;I am Jehovah your God&rdquo;&mdash;we can impress them in a brief and simple way that there is an almighty One in the universe, who is our God. Following this, we can help them to know God&rsquo;s creation and even the fall of man. For this purpose we should not merely tell stories. Instead, we should present these matters in a very practical way, using many illustrations. The best time to present the fall of man is after we have helped them to know what a proper humanity is. We may ask them one by one, &ldquo;Can you practice what you have heard? Have you honored your parents? Have you loved your brothers?&rdquo; Many of them will admit that they cannot, and some may even shed tears. Then we should ask, &ldquo;Why have you failed? Why can you not do this?&rdquo; At this point we can tell them that we are all fallen creatures and that there is sin within us that weakens us. To speak concerning the fall in this way is very realistic.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we can tell them how the Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption. Again, we should not speak this as a mere story. Rather, we can use the lessons concerning proper humanity and the proper way to behave. We can say, &ldquo;We know that God commanded us to honor our parents, but we have failed. In the Bible this failure is called sin. How can this problem be solved?&rdquo; This is the way to speak concerning sin and the problem of sins. Then we can point out to them that the Son of God has died for us, and we can tell them about the cross, the death of Christ, and redemption without passing on mere religious knowledge. After they reach a certain age, we can go on to tell them that Christ is life, not as a mere story but based on their failures and desires. We can ask, &ldquo;Do you want to have the strength to behave yourself in this wonderful way? You must realize that you yourself do not have this strength. You need Christ to be your life and power.&rdquo; This is the best way to help them. Without giving them too much knowledge, we can help them in a practical way to realize what God, creation, humanity, the fall, redemption, and Christ are, and eventually we can help them to receive the Lord and be saved in a definite way.</p>
<p>When many of us were young, we received too much knowledge that only damaged us. We were given many stories, but we were not given the proper verses in a practical way. Because of this, no one could speak to us, for example, about the prodigal son. We may have said, &ldquo;There is no need to talk about that. I already know what the father, the son, the robe, and the calf are. I can tell you the story.&rdquo; After hearing all the teachings and stories from the Bible, young ones become &ldquo;slippery&rdquo; so that nothing sticks to them. We must not spoil the young ones in this way. Those who have never heard the stories before are easily inspired by them. This is why we should withhold certain stories and simply help the children to know the things of humanity and of God in a practical way. Then when they are saved and begin to attend the church meetings, what they hear will be new to them.</p>
<p>When the children are young, we should simply tell them about God, His creation, and other simple things. At least by the time they are eight years old, we should help them to realize something concerning the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, and gradually after that, we can help them to know that Christ is life. We should not pass on matters such as pray-reading until they are at least ten or eleven, at which time they should know something concerning how to fellowship with the Lord. For the younger ones, illustrations and demonstrations are more helpful. If we conduct the meetings with the children in a proper way, a two-hour meeting will not be too long. On the contrary, though, to merely tell them story after story will tire them.</p>
<p>The most important matter is to build up the humanity and character of the children. This is neglected by many parents today. Having a good human character will not hinder the children in any way. The teachings of Confucius and Chinese ethics build up character according to the self with self-pride and self-confidence. The kind of character building we practice is absolutely different. We should build up the children in the way of realizing that they can do nothing in themselves, because they are fallen and need a higher life. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967</em>, vol. 1, pp. 504-506)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>We may divide the children into two or three levels. Some saints will need to work on the lesson materials, and some need to tell the stories. Children ages four through six may be on the first level. With these ones you only need to sing hymns with them and tell them stories. Children ages seven through nine may be on the second level. With these ones you need to teach them something, which may require some lesson materials. Children ages ten through twelve may be on the third level. With them you need lesson materials to help teach them something deeper. (<em>Being Up-to-date for the Rebuilding of the Temple,</em> pp. 46-47)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Perhaps there are brothers and sisters among us who are especially experienced with and burdened for the children. They should come forth and give us some materials so that the children in various localities may receive the benefit. They should come forth and give us some materials that the children in various localities may receive the benefit. Perhaps there are already some brothers who are preparing songs for the children.</p>
<p>If the children&rsquo;s meeting is carried out properly, it will also provide a good opportunity for some people to believe in the Lord. This meeting indeed needs to be strong. In the future I hope that there will be a few brothers and sisters who will come forth to prepare some materials for the brothers to take care of the children.

<p><em>Question: We have been trying to write children&rsquo;s songs using the Scriptures to help the children memorize the Word. It is almost impossible to rhyme these songs since their content is the Scriptures themselves. How do you feel about this point?</em></p>
<p>To write songs for children is a difficult task, but in principle, I do not agree with writing songs for them with verses from the Scripture. If we want to help the children remember some verses from the Bible, we can simply instruct them to read and recite the verses. We should not try to make the verses singable for the children. I do not mean that we should not do this at all, but this is difficult to do. To write songs for children requires a great amount of skill. Poetry must be composed for the young ones in a very skillful way. I saw a number of songs for the children that were all below standard according to my feeling. It is better not to have songs if the songs that we have are of such a low standard. (<em>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ,</em> pp. 82-83)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
