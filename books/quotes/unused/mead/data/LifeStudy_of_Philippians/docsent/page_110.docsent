   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE RICHES OF CHRIST REALIZED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>EMBODIED IN THE RICH WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:9; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; Col 3:16; John 16:13-15; 6:63</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s desire is that we who have been redeemed, saved, washed by the blood, and regenerated by the Spirit, and have received the life and nature of God should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not adequate simply to improve our behavior or the standard of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a way that is very experiential and practical, we need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE AND EXTENSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to live Christ, we must realize who Christ is and what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the book of Colossians we have seen that Christ is not only all-inclusive, but also extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is both the mystery of God and the mystery of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is God, man, and the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This, of course, is not pantheism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is to testify according to Colossians 2:16 and 17 that Christ is the body, the reality, of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Colossians 2:16 and 17 Paul says, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the principle set forth in these verses, Christ is the real holiday, or holy day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As our holiday, Christ is our rest, joy, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With Christ every day is a holiday.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without Him, every day is miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even during difficult times, we may experience a true holiday if we have Christ as our joy, enjoyment, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is also our new moon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Again and again we all need a new start, a new beginning, as signified by a new moon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is such a new moon to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every day in our contact with Him, we may experience a new moon, a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to these verses from Colossians, Christ is also our eating, drinking, and feast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Words cannot exhaust what Christ is in His extensiveness and all-inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Christ is so extensive and all-inclusive, He is our enjoyment and experience, and we can live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OUR LIFE AND LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Along with all genuine Christians, we believe that Christ is our Redeemer and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is God incarnate, and He lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then He died on the cross, shedding His blood to cleanse us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now He is our Savior in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we emphatically believe that Christ is our Redeemer and Savior and have experienced Him as such, we have come to realize that Christ is also our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, as life He has been supplied once for all; on the other hand, He is supplied to us continually as life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Life requires a continual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have life but lack the means to maintain it, we shall die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Breathing, for example, is a necessary matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As such, it must go on continually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we may graduate from school, we cannot graduate from breathing and remain alive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Graduation from the matters of life can only mean death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We praise the Lord that Christ is our Redeemer, Savior, and also our life and life supply!</S>
