   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE ONE THE BACKGROUND AND SUBJECT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BOOK Scripture Reading: Gal 1:1-7; 3:1, 3; 4:17, 21; 5:2, 4; 6:12, 15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians form a cluster of Epistles which make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, these books are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians covers the church as the Body of Christ, whereas Colossians deals with Christ as the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Galatians is concerned with Christ, and Philippians, with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Colossians and Ephesians we receive a clear view of the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Galatians and Philippians we see Christ and the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as there are four seasons in the year, so there are seasons in our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that in our experience with the Lord we pass through winter as well as summer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The winter experiences are helpful, for they prepare us for a new beginning, which comes in the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the winter season the various kinds of life are reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the reduction that takes place in winter, life is prepared to grow again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because in our spiritual experience there is the need for us to be reduced, we must be ready for winter at the appointed time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may say that Galatians is a winter book, a book that reduces us and eliminates everything that should not be permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this reduction serves a very positive purpose: it prepares us for further growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to be reduced not only in things that are natural or worldly, but even in the various aspects of our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the sake of further growth in the Lord, we need to be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Certain things in our Christian life may be very good, scriptural, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But as long as these things are not Christ Himself directly, they should not be given a place with us very long.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only Christ Himself should have a permanent place in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All other things, even the most spiritual experiences, must be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for this reduction to take place, God ordains winter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never expect to have an endless summer in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, we should expect the recurring cycle of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we come to a winter in our experience with the Lord, we should be encouraged that spring and summer will follow in due time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we should be encouraged to be reduced in order to have another new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is my hope that these messages on Galatians will serve this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I. THE BACKGROUND</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to study the book of Galatians properly, it is important to know the background and the subject of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the books in the New Testament have a particular background.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We thank the Lord for these backgrounds, even though, for the most part, they were not very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord uses the negative background as a basis for the release of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more negative a certain background is, the greater is the opportunity for the Lord to release His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The worse the background, the greater is the need for God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we see this, we shall thank the Lord for all the negative backgrounds that made it necessary for the books in the New Testament to be written.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Gospel of John is a good example of a New Testament book written against a negative background.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Gospel was written during the last decade of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time there was a tendency, even among Christians, to deny the deity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some were doubting Christ s deity, and others were even denying this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With such a trend as the background, this Gospel was written by the Apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without this Gospel, we could not have an adequate understanding of Christ s deity and His eternal existence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Neither could we realize how Christ could become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But through the Gospel of John we clearly see that Christ s deity is eternal and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this Gospel we also have the clear view of eternal life and of how Christ can be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If there had not been such a dark background at the end of the first century, this wonderful Gospel probably would not have been written.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Epistles of Paul were also written according to certain backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First Corinthians, for example, was written because of the confusion and divisiveness in the church at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we did not have the book of 1 Corinthians, we would not know how Christ could be our enjoyment in all kinds of situations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This book describes the enjoyment of Christ in a way not found elsewhere in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should thank the Lord for the confusion in Corinth that gave rise to this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The book of Colossians was also written according to a particular background, the background of the culture that had invaded the church at Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With this cultural invasion as the background, the marvelous book of Colossians was written.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without that background, we would not have this book today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same principle, the recovery of justification by faith at the time of the Reformation came forth out of a negative situation and a dark background.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Apart from such a situation and background, the truth of justification by faith would not be as clear as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This truth can no longer be blurred because the dark background causes it to stand out so definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we come to the background of the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Written before A.D. 60, Galatians is earlier than either Ephesians or Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Galatians was written in the earlier part of Paul s ministry, before he was imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to have the proper experience of the church as the Body of Christ, we need the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need both an adequate experience and understanding of all that is conveyed to us in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we intend to practice the church life today, we need to know the Christ revealed in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Galatians reveals that Christ is versus religion with its law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The law given by God through Moses was the foundation of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Judaism was built on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The book of Galatians reveals that the very Christ whom we need for the church life is versus law and religion.</S>
