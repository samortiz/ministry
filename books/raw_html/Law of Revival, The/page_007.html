        <h2 class="head1">SEEING THE VISION OF RESURRECTION<br />
DELIVERING US FROM EVERY PROBLEM</h2>
<p>We all need to see this vision of resurrection. Only then can we leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills, that is, overcome our environment. The problems in our heart, in our family, in our environment, and in the church are mountains and hills that cannot be overcome merely by our enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness and abundance. These problems require that we have the vision of resurrection and see the transcendence of our resurrected Lord, who is undeterred by any problem. This is the only way that we can overcome our problems.</p>
<p>I believe that some saints will see such a vision. The Lord will bring us out of living according to our emotions so that our relationship with Him will be based on revelation and vision, not on emotions. We will see that He is in resurrection and that He dwells in us. This resurrected Lord is the power of resurrection. Once we see this vision, we will be delivered, and we, like the Lord, will be able to leap upon mountains and skip upon hills. Then strong opposition, burdensome troubles, grave sickness, and great turmoil and torment will not restrict us, because we no longer experience the Lord merely as a bundle of myrrh or a cluster of henna flowers. Rather, in our experience He will be like a young hart leaping upon mountains and skipping upon hills; He cannot be deterred by any environment. A bundle of myrrh may be fragrant, and a cluster of henna flowers may be beautiful, but they are powerless. Power rests with the young hart and is in resurrection.</p>
<p>Our problems exist because we know only how the Lord satisfies us and gives us rest. We have yet to see that He is the resurrected Lord, that He is in resurrection, and that His resurrection power is in us. Therefore, we continue to live according to our feelings, in the ups and downs of our emotions. When we feel good, we are excited, but when we do not feel good, we are oppressed. We rejoice when we touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but we are miserable when we cannot touch His presence. We praise and give thanks when the environment is smooth, but we murmur and complain when the environment is rough. These reactions prove that we urgently need an objective vision of Christ in resurrection. When we see this vision, we will transcend our difficulties. We will be able to soar and to move like a pillar of smoke. We will not be restricted by a desolate situation, nor will we be troubled by our outward environment. The turmoils and disturbances will be under our feet; we will be above them, skipping upon the mountains and leaping upon the hills. How we urgently need such a vision and experience!</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM LIVING<br />
ACCORDING TO FEELINGS<br />
EQUIVALENT TO BEING DELIVERED FROM THE SELF</h2>
<p>When the Lord calls us to come out of our feelings, He wants us to come out of the self. In chapter 3 the beloved compels his seeker not only to rise from her bed but also to come out of her house (vv. 1-2). In these verses the beloved is compelling his seeker to be delivered from living according to her emotions, which is to be delivered from the self.</p>
<p>Many of us are shut in the &ldquo;room&rdquo; of the self. Many are locked in the self. We are often closed when we attend meetings and when we visit the saints, because we still live according to our emotions. When we came together seven or eight years ago, we were open and released because we had a sweet feeling, but we no longer have such a sweet feeling, and the taste of freshness and vitality is gone. As a result, we are closed in the self and are not willing to open. Both our past and present situations prove that we have not been delivered from living a life according to our feelings, which is to live in the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A REVIVAL BY OPENING</h2>
<p>The only way to have a revival, a new beginning, is to be open. This is the only way to be fresh. We need to open and be released instead of being locked inside the self. It is very simple to open ourselves. For example, instead of being shut within our oppressed self, we can tell a brother that we feel oppressed and old. If we would open to one another whenever we meet together, there would be a revival among us. There are many serving ones in the churches. On the one hand, we know one another because we see one another nearly every day, but on the other hand, we do not know one another, because we are closed. I do not open my inner spiritual condition to you, and you do not reveal your inner spiritual condition to me. How can there be a revival among us under such circumstances?</p>
<p>Throughout church history, those who sought for a revival always prayed for power from heaven to rain on them. However, the believers who experienced being revived testified that genuine revivals do not come from heaven. Revivals come from within us, because the resurrected Lord is now the Spirit indwelling us. The Spirit is filled with all the riches of Christ and dwells even in the most desolate believer. Hence, the power of revival does not descend from heaven, from an objective position. This power is already dwelling in us. The question is whether this power can come forth, that is, whether we will let this power come forth.</p>
<p>We often do not understand the Lord&rsquo;s word. Romans 10:6-9 says, &ldquo;Do not say in your heart, &lsquo;Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ down; or, &lsquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ up from the dead...&lsquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,&rsquo;...that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&rdquo; A person who desires to be saved does not have to ascend into heaven or descend into the earth in order to find Christ, because the word is near him, in his mouth and in his heart. Therefore, once a person believes and confesses, he is saved. This word is for those who have not experienced salvation and do not have the Holy Spirit within them. If it is so easy for them to be saved, how much easier would it be for those who are saved and have the Spirit dwelling in them to be revived? We should not think that the revival will come to us from heaven or from the abyss; it simply needs to flow out of us. The impression that we receive from reading the history of revivals in the church is that believers anticipate that revivals would descend from above. However, those who have experience realize that the power they thought would descend from above actually flows out of their inner being. Hence, the key to revival is being open. The power in us is an explosive force. As long as we are willing to open and let it explode from within us, we will have a prevailing revival.</p>
<p>It is right to say that we need to pray in order to have a revival. However, I must repeat that the key, the secret, of having a revival is not in our asking the Lord to give us something from above but in our opening to Him and letting Him flow out. Being open is the basic principle for allowing the Holy Spirit to work in us. The more we are reserved and closed, the less likely we are to receive grace. More than twenty years ago the Pentecostal movement was popular in northern China. This movement focused on people receiving the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Although many things in this movement were extreme and even heretical, it encouraged those who were closed and reserved to open.</p>
<p>For example, a helper would kneel down with someone and lead him to confess his sins. The helper would ask, &ldquo;Do you have sins?&rdquo; and the person would say, &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo; Then the helper would ask, &ldquo;What kind of sins?&rdquo; and the person might answer, &ldquo;I offended my parents.&rdquo; The helper would further ask, &ldquo;How did you offend your parents?&rdquo; This questioning and answering would continue until the person finished confessing his sins. As a result, his entire being would be open, and he would receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We might say that this was human work; nevertheless, human work ushers in the work of heaven so that the Holy Spirit can be poured out upon man. Some of the people who experienced such an outpouring were delivered from their addictions or forsook their bad habits and sins. This is an important principle: it is easy for a person who is open to receive grace.</p>
<p>This is where our problem lies. When we come together for fellowship or in the meetings, we are closed. Most of the saints who come to the prayer meeting on Tuesday night come with a closed attitude. They have made up their mind not to open their mouth to pray. How can we have a strong prayer meeting? Perhaps in the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting we should give messages concerning being open in order to encourage the saints to open. Some saints might feel reluctant to speak because they are not &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by the Holy Spirit. However, as long as we are open, inspiration will come. The less we open, the more difficult it will be to open, and the more we wait for inspiration, the less inspiration we will receive.</p>
<p>We have a treasure in us, but it is locked up. It does not matter whether we are weak, strong, cold, or burning. When we are burning, this rich source is in us, and when we are cold, this rich source is still in us. This source never changes. The question is whether we would let it flow out.</p>
<p>When I was young, I liked to play with firecrackers. I would get about a dozen firecrackers and use a pin to open the paper wrapping around the fuse so that the gunpowder was exposed. Then I would set off a couple of firecrackers and let them explode. The sparks from these firecrackers would touch other firecrackers and kindle the gunpowder. As a result, all the firecrackers would explode. This analogy is fitting for Christians. Each of us is a firecracker, and Christ is our gunpowder. Our problem is that Christ is securely wrapped within us, and we are neither willing to be broken nor to open. We pray for a revival, but we keep ourselves tightly closed. Hence, we cannot &ldquo;explode,&rdquo; and even our earnest prayer does not avail. If we want to pray, we should pray that the Lord would cause us to open.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN IN ORDER TO BRING IN A REVIVAL</h2>
<p>We must submit to the Lord and humbly ask Him to give us a vision. We should not merely have enjoyment, satisfaction, and a sense of sweetness in our pursuit of the Lord. We need to see that the Lord is in resurrection. We need a vision of resurrection so that we would be able to leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills. In spite of the things pressing on our spirit and the difficulties in our environment, we need to see that the Lord is living and strong in us; He is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. If we would know resurrection and be open, we would be like unwrapped firecrackers. Once one firecracker explodes, it can kindle the others. If I am open, I can burn someone else until he is open, and then he can burn me. As a result, we will have a genuine revival. Both lingering in our past experiences and remaining closed will result in death. The more we linger in our past experiences and remain closed, the more deadened we will be. We must learn to be open. Even if we are skeptical, we should still practice to be open in every occasion. Then the unlimited supply will gush up from within us, and we will experience a spiritual revival.</p>
<p>To be open does not mean to speak a frank word or to rebuke others. That is to spread death. To be open is to pour out and speak forth our true condition. If we feel weak, corrupt, deficient, old, stale, or dead, we should open our situation. The Lord is in us, and when we open in this way, He comes forth. This is the secret to having a revival. If we study the revivals in church history, we will find that this is the secret. We need to pray more so that we would be open, and we need power so that we may help others to open. Once a person opens, he will be revived. If we know this key and are willing to be open in every meeting and in our times of fellowship, we will be living, and the Lord will have a way to move.</p>
<p>I hope that these words will cause us to open and let the Lord flow forth. This principle will bring in a revival.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
