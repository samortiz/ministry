   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE LINE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we open the Bible and read at the very beginning in the book of Genesis, we see a very striking item the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we read through to the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation we once again see the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning of the Bible the tree of life is present, in the middle there are stories of life, and at the end the tree of life is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From this we should realize that the biblical revelation regards life as its center and its line.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we will briefly touch the key points on the line of life in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. LIFE BEING THE CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF GOD S CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we read the record of God s creation in Genesis 1 and 2, the more we should realize that the center of God s creation is life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it seems like many things should be mentioned concerning God s creation, the account in Genesis 1 and 2 is very simple; it simply speaks of the aspects of God s creation that pertain to life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of the criticism by scientists about the book of Genesis is really misplaced because the account in Genesis is not a complete record of God s creation but merely a record of the portion concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now let us speak briefly about Genesis 1 and 2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genesis 1:2 describes the earth, prior to God s further creation, as being waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These words fully convey a scene of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Waste is related to death; darkness is related to death; even the deep water is related to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, initially everything there was related to death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this situation, God began His work of re-creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A. The Spirit Coming</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit of God brooded upon the surface of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the principle in the Bible, whenever the Spirit comes, it is for created beings to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. Light Coming</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever the Bible speaks of light shining, it is for man to receive God s life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>C. Light Being Separated from Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to have life, light must be separated from darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>D. That Which Is Above Being Separated</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>from That Which Is Under</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to have life, the things which are above must also be separated from the things which are under.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>E. Dry Land Being Separated from the Waters</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The dry land was separated from the waters in order that the dry land could bring forth life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>F. Life Coming Forth</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At this point, all kinds of life were brought forth from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The bringing forth of different kinds of life involved a definite sequence, and all of these kinds of life have symbolic meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lowest Life</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Created Life without Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Plants were the first things that grew on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Plant life is without consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A leaf of grass, a tree, or a flower contains life, but this life is without consciousness; it can neither think nor feel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the plant life came forth, the light bearers came the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The appearance of these stronger lights was not for producing life but for strengthening life so that life could grow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, immediately after these lights came forth, a higher life appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The stronger the light, the more life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lower Life</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>the Created Life with the Lowest Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Next, the living creatures in the water were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of living creature has some consciousness, but it is the lowest consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though this life is a little higher than the plant life, it is still a relatively lower life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Slightly Higher Life</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>the Created Life with Low Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Gradually, living creatures in the air came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their life is higher than the life of the living creatures in the water, but the consciousness of this life is still relatively low.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Higher Life</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>the Created Life with Higher Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Next, cattle and beasts on the earth came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the consciousness of the life increases step by step, the level of life also increases step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Superior Life</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>the Created Life with the Highest Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Lastly, man was created as the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Among all the creatures, man has the highest life with the highest consciousness, a consciousness that is higher than all other creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, in the whole universe, man does not have the highest consciousness nor the highest life; God has the highest life with the highest consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In summary, we can see clearly that the center of God s creation is life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God first created inanimate things and then living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then, with regard to the living creatures, He began by creating the lowest living creatures, going up level by level to the highest living creatures.</S>
