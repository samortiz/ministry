   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me ask again: What is the difference between law and grace?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, let us consider what the law is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law is something from God and yet apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It tells us what is good and what is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For a man to touch the law is like touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can have life through touching the law Gal 3:11, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, condemnation follows the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as we touch the law, we touch condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What then is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Grace is God received, and truth is God seen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The highest and ultimate definition of grace is God Himself 1 Cor 15:10; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the law in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything that is outside of God is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the meaning of the word outwardly in the following verses: "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter" Rom 2:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Jews mortify their own flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They circumcise themselves and keep the law and the Sabbath, but these things are of the law and are letters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace is God alone and nothing else besides Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, receiving grace means that man receives God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GOAL OF GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's salvation saves us to the point where we can stand before God and say, "I do not know what is evil, and I do not know what is good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I will not do evil, but neither will I do good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both good and evil are foreign things to me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I only know to receive God as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I want to live by God's nature."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outwardly in Romans 2 refers to all the good outside of God, and inwardly in this passage describes everything that issues from God; it actually refers to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man must first be delivered from the self before he can be fully delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may not have a temper, but as long as we are not delivered from the self, we are not delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within us, there is no goodness, only sin Rom 7:14, 18; 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us use the kerosene lamp as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the kerosene lamp burns, it gives out smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only way it will not give out smoke is when it does not burn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Christian is someone who has an "electric light" installed within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is not concerned about burning or smoking anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He only wants to know if we are using the "electric light" or if we are still using our "kerosene lamp."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we refuse to use the "electric light" and insist on the "kerosene lamp," we can only choose between burning with smoke or not having any light at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The entire Bible shows us that it is God's pleasure to enter into man, pass through man, and then come out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God likes to be touched by man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason life is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is in life, and life is in Christ for us to receive 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as we touch the Spirit, we receive the life of Christ, which means we receive God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the coming out of God Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God enters into us, Christ enters into us, which is life entering into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has ordained this from the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He desires to join Himself to man so that His life, nature, mind, light, likes, dislikes, and preferences can become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The ultimate goal of God's salvation is to come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means His mind, preferences, likes, and dislikes become our mind, preferences, likes, and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The goal of God's salvation is to bring us to the point where we can praise Him for delivering us not only from evil, but from good as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can proudly say that we do not know evil and we do not know good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not know hatred, and we do not know love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We only know God, and we only have God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In other words, we do not live in ourselves any longer; instead, we live in God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's salvation saves us from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if Adam had not sinned, God would still have wanted him to take Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wants man to take His life as his life, His feeling as his feeling, His mind as his mind, and His preference as his preference.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He wants to mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When God's salvation has reached its goal and the work of salvation is complete in eternity, we will see a wonderful picture: God will be in man and man will be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the New Jerusalem in eternity, there will be no other fruit except the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of us will eat the fruit of the tree of life; we will only be enjoying God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's salvation does more than save us from sinfulness to sinlessness or from evil to good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His salvation wroughts Himself into us to be our life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In learning to serve and to know our spirit, we have to touch this point.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, everything will be outward, not inward.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that we all will see clearly the central goal of God's salvation so that our service and spiritual ministry will be calibrated according to this central goal.</S>
