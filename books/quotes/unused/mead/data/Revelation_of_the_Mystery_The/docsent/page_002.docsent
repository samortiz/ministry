   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:5, 8-11; 3:3-6; 5:17; Col 1:9b; 2:2b; 1 Cor 2:7; Rev 4:11b; Rom 12:2; Matt 6:10 THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE AND HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The verses listed above show us God's eternal purpose, God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone needs to know God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If as a young person you are somewhat thoughtful, you do not need to be a great philosopher to eventually ask questions such as, "What is the meaning of my life in the world?" and, "For what purpose was I born?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you consider even further, you might also ask, "Why do the heavens and the earth exist?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why does the universe exist?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you give a little thought to these matters, you will discover that the meaning of human life cannot be found in clothing, food, housing, or transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You will also conclude that the meaning of the heavens, the earth, and all things cannot be focused merely on human living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These conclusions, however, reveal only what the meaning of the universe and of human life is not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is difficult to determine a direct answer to the questions concerning the true meaning of the universe and the true meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to find the definite answer to these questions, we must look in the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today there are millions and millions of books in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, there is only one book the Bible that clearly explains the meaning of the universe and the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Scripture verses listed at the beginning of this message are the answer to these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would thoroughly get into these verses, we would see the meaning of the universe as well as the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We would see why the universe exists, why human life exists, and why we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These few passages from the Scriptures tell us that God has a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A purpose is a plan, and a plan is a purpose; however, plan may be a better word than purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's eternal purpose is God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word for plan in Greek has the sense of "beforehand."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A purpose, design, or plan exists before the actual event occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In brief, God's eternal plan is that the universe, including the heavens, the earth, and a myriad of items, would be a background or backdrop and that the center of all these things would be man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man is the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's plan is to gain a group of people to be His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God desires to have an expression for Himself, and He wants this expression through man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's desire is not to be expressed through angels nor through any other creature but to be expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, He does not want this expression to be through an individual man but through a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God's eternal plan is to obtain a corporate man to be His expression in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How will He obtain a corporate man as His expression?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will do so by dispensing His life and nature into this corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, He ordained that this man should have the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God planned beforehand and foreordained that we would receive the sonship, that is, that we would be born of Him and become His sons, having His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This matter is absolutely unrelated to man's fall and his acts of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If man had not fallen and sinned, and even if Satan, the devil, did not exist in this universe, God would still desire to carry out this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because God's purpose, God's plan, is that the heavens, the earth, and all the myriad of items in the universe would be for the existence of a group of people whom God would regenerate to be His sons and who would have God's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although God is divine and these people are human, God's divine life and nature would enter into them so that they would possess His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He would be the Father of these people, and they would be His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, they would receive the sonship not for the enjoyment of abundant blessings but for the expression of God.</S>
