   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXERCISING TO PRACTICE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our daily business, our trade, is to tell people about Christ, baptize them, and bring them to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On this earth there is such a marvelous trade, but to work in this trade successfully, we have to mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I pray, the cry in my heart is, "Lord, You must build up the practice of the new way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This should have been built up centuries ago, but it was not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It should have been built up fifty years ago when Brother Nee saw this matter, but it was not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now, Lord, I have been speaking concerning Your ordained way for over five years, yet it is still not being practiced so fully and adequately."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this does not mean that the new way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This way works, but not everyone in this kind of business will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are desperate will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If some fail, it is because they are not desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be clear that we are going out to get persons saved and regenerated to be sons of God and members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After baptizing some, we have to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All year long we should have two or three newly baptized ones under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do this faithfully, in one year we will surely gain one or two as remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If each of us can gain one or two as remaining fruit in one year, that would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regardless of how much fruit we bear, we must keep going out to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we go out continuously and faithfully for the next thirty years, eventually each one of us could gain fifty as remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we can go with these fifty fruit to see the Lord and say, "Lord, here are my fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would be very good if out of one hundred meeting together, fifty would go out to practice the priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If not half, at least we would expect one-third to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If thirty saints out of one hundred would do this, it is possible for the church to increase fifty percent in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I recently had a long talk with one of the leading brothers from Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He meets together regularly with a group of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Last February there were only twenty in this group, but by August it had grown to over fifty; it had more than doubled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By November this group had increased to over eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In only nine months, that group has increased more than fourfold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then he told me the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said, "The secret is to simply go out to practice the four steps of the God-ordained way."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He told me that practicing the new way really works, especially for the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This brother said that many of those brought in were brought in through the work of the new ones themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Taiwan it is possible to find many who have never been in Christianity and who have never learned anything about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said that working with this kind of new one for only one hour can accomplish much, much more than working for many hours with one who has already been a Christian for a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Someone who has been a Christian for some years can become an "old Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They can become the hardest ones for the Lord to work on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I want to impress us and encourage us to practice the definite steps of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not work in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may not be so desperate in practicing these definite steps.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may not have a definite work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This leading brother from Taipei was desperate to have morning watch with the new ones every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through this, every new one, within one or two days after being baptized, had a good morning revival and became fully revived.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may do many good works, but we may not have a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This leading brother from Taipei does not care for other things; he only cares for these few things to beget new ones, to feed them, to stir them up, and to revive them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a school teacher receives a message that his friend is seriously sick, does he stop teaching and go to visit his friend?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he leaves for two weeks, he will lose his job.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even a mother cannot forsake her responsibilities in the household to go to care for someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She has a duty to stay home to prepare food and care for her family's needs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way, we must be occupied with our priestly duty in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to realize our grave responsibility to gain sinners for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After you baptize two or three, you should stop baptizing and endeavor to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have begotten some children, and now these babes are under your care.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do not feed them, you are neglecting your duty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no excuse for leaving your babes without any care.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your primary responsibility is to take care of your babes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At least you should be able to complete these first three steps with the new ones begetting, feeding, and perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then they will all learn to meet, to pray, to function, and to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am very burdened to strongly encourage you to exercise and practice what you have already heard.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the present need, yet this is very difficult for us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of us, including me, are "old-timers."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have a strong Christian background with many old things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To get rid of this is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, there is the need for some of the local saints to pick up the burden and be desperate to exercise to practice these steps of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They must go out regularly and persistently, once every week, with a definite goal each time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They must practice the steps of the new way begetting, feeding, perfecting, and prophesying in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They should always have two or three under their constant care.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way some of the local saints will be able to raise up some new churches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some saints can go to a nearby city to labor, and I hope that the elders will take the lead to send them out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After half a year there can be little churches of about fifteen saints in some surrounding cities.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They will produce elders from among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the city of Monterey Park, California, about forty began to meet together in April of 1988.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today, after only one and a half years, they have grown to over one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This small church was raised up, nourished, built, and established particularly according to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In San Gabriel, California, about fourteen began to meet together at about the same time that those in Monterey Park began.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now, after one and a half years, they have close to sixty in their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is also another church in that area Hacienda Heights.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They have been meeting there for about two years.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They began with a few saints, and now they have one hundred fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These churches were born through much travail.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They have grown and become healthy by practicing the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Luke 19 and Matthew 25 show that the Lord has given us some capital and that we have been charged to do business.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He demands a profit from His investment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In Matthew 24 each of us is the servant whom the Lord has set over His household.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When He returns, we will receive either a reward or a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Matthew 25 we are His slaves, and He wants us to do business for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When He comes back, He will demand that we give Him an account of our business, and we will either receive a reward or a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If I did not speak this to you, I would not be faithful to the Lord or to you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I only care for the burden I have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I believe that some faithful saints will carry out God's ordained way on the earth.</S>
