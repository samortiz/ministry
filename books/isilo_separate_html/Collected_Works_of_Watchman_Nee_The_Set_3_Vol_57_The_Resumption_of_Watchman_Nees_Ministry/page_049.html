Is there a difference between individual leadings and leadings in the Body?</p><p>Brother Nee: Catholicism and Protestantism belong to two different systems. In Protestantism everyone is led individually by his own conscience. In Catholicism everything is governed absolutely by the church's leading. The Catholic Church thinks that all of God's leadings come through the church and that a man cannot come to God directly, but must come to Him through the church. The Protestants oppose this. They think that a man should follow God according to his free conscience. Protestantism rejected Catholicism, but in so doing, it brought in Sardis and paved the way for Laodicea. God wants His people to come out of Thyatira. He also wants His people to come out of Sardis.</p><h2 class="head2">Personal Leading Being a Matter<br />of the Sense of the Inner Life</h2><p>In the Bible there are two instances where the matter of God's leading is covered. The first place is the first Epistle of John, which speaks of the leading of the anointing (2:27). The second place is the book of Hebrews, which speaks of the leading in the new covenant (10:10-12). The former emphasizes the knowledge of spiritual senses, whereas the latter emphasizes the knowledge of God's law. The new covenant teaches us to know God's law, whereas the anointing teaches us to know the way to serve God. Only when we live before God do we know His law. We make judgments concerning everything by the responses of the inner life, not by outward regulations. In the same principle we come to know what is of God and what is not of Him by the anointing, not by outward teachings.</p><p>We have to be careful to realize that these leadings concern only our knowledge of God before Him; they do not include all other kinds of leadings. If we are not careful and if we generalize these leadings to mean all kinds of leadings, concluding that all kinds of leadings come directly and independently from God, we will have a problem. First John and Hebrews are on the leading concerning the knowledge of God. As to the leading concerning the Lord's way on earth, we have to look at the book of Acts. The mistake of Catholicism lies in the fact that it not only holds a tight rein on the leading concerning the way of the church, but also takes over the leading of the individual consciences.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
