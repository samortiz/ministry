   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here I will give a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will find the New Testament expressions in the Lord, in Christ, in Christ Jesus, etc. It never says in Jesus or in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It only says in Christ Jesus, not in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must memorize and jot down these facts one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Find where it says in the Lord and what the context is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Find where it says in Christ and what the context is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Find yet another place where it says in Christ Jesus and what the context is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we know all these portions by heart, we can compare them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why does it say in Christ in one instance instead of in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why does one place say in Christ Jesus and not in Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why does the Bible never say in Jesus or in Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we analyze and compare the Scriptures in this way, looking to God for enlightenment, we will see something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the light comes, everything will become very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus is the name given to the Lord while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the name given to Him after His resurrection when God anointed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"God has made Him both Lord and Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you remember these words in Acts 2?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the name given to Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In reading Romans we find the words Christ Jesus, which mean that the Christ today is the very Jesus who was on earth in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ Jesus is His name today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the Christ today is the very Jesus who was on earth before.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His name before resurrection was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This name implies that Jesus would one day be the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus was His name when He lived on earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These two expressions Christ being once Jesus, and Jesus eventually becoming Christ mean two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, we can only be in Christ, not in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can only be in the Lord and in Christ Jesus, not in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord was on earth, we could not be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we had been in Him when He was on earth, we would have taken part in His cross and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is contrary to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have no part in His incarnation at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was the only begotten Son of God, and we have no part in that.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How then can we be in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him God you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It does not say in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the Lord Jesus died and resurrected, we became joined to Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through His death and resurrection, God has made Him the Christ, and God has joined us to Him through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We received His life at the time of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regeneration does not come through incarnation but through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we should be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the way to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is how we study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then memorize, analyze, categorize, and compare these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After this pray to the Lord and wait on Him; He will enlighten you and give you sight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are the four principles of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot skip any one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let us give another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider the word about the coming of the Holy Spirit in John 14 and 15.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In reading these passages, we must pay attention to the promise of the Lord Jesus and discover whether there are any special facts related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>John 14:16-20 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What facts can we discover here?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These sentences first use He or Him but later change to I. There is a change in pronoun.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here is a fact: The words He and Him have been changed to I.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the four principles of reading the Bible, how should we deal with this passage?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, we should discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this case, the pronoun change from He to I is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Second, we must remember this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Third, we must analyze this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here are two Comforters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord says, "I will ask the Father, and He the Father will give you another Comforter."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The word another in the expression another Comforter means this is the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"And He the Father will give you another Comforter."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that the Father will give a second Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If there is a second Comforter, there must be a first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The first thing we can ascertain is that the Lord is speaking of two Comforters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord said that the disciples already had one Comforter, but that He was going to give them another.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What kind of Comforter is the second?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"That He may be with you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Who is the He?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord Jesus said, "The world...does not...know Him; but you know Him."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>"Because He abides with you."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He was with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The world cannot receive Him and has not even seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What about them?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The disciples had seen Him; they knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They knew Him because He was abiding with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord said, "Because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After this point the pronoun He is no longer used.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the next sentence the Lord said, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In studying this, we find that He is I, and I is He.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In other words, while the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He was the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Holy Spirit was in the Lord, and the Lord was the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When the Lord was on earth, the Holy Spirit was in Him; He and the Holy Spirit were one.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is why He said that the disciples beheld Him and knew Him and that He was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But then what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord went on to tell them that another Comforter would come.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Following His death and resurrection, the Lord said that He would come back to them and that God would give them the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But how was this to be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord Himself would come to them again in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He did not leave them orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After a little while they would see Him no longer, but then they would see Him again, and He would abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Verse 17 says, "He...in you."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Then verse 20 says, "I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Thus, the I in the second section is the He in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Once we see the change in pronouns, we see the difference in the two Comforters.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The first section refers to the Holy Spirit in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The second section refers to Christ in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He refers to the Holy Spirit in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I refers to Christ in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Who is the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Son is the Father in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In the same way, the Holy Spirit is the Son in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>There is only a change in form.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>From this example we see that the first basic principle in reading the Bible is to discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If we cannot discover any facts, we cannot expect to receive any light from God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is not a question of how many times we have read the Bible, but a question of the facts we have discovered through our many times of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Paul was a person who knew how to discover facts.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Consider what he said in Galatians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He saw from Genesis that God would bless the nations through the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>God used the word seed in its singular form, not in its plural form.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>First, Paul discovered this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He saw that the nations would be blessed through the seed of Abraham, and he saw that this was a unique seed.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>From this he realized that this seed referred to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If it had been plural, it would have referred to the many children of Abraham, that is, the Jews, and the meaning would be completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Paul read the Scripture thoroughly and discovered the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In the Bible there are many facts.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Whether or not a person is rich in God's Word depends on how many facts he has discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The more facts he discovers, the richer he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>If he cannot discover any facts and if he reads through the Bible in a hasty and mindless way, he will not understand much.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>In reading the Bible, we must learn to discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>After this we should memorize, analyze, and compare these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Finally, we should kneel down before God and ask for light.</S>
