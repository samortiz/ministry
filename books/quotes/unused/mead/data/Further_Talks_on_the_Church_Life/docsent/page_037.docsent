   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Unity in the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we will look at the third kind of unity, that is, the unity in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Inherent Unity of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Scriptures show us that the church is the Body of Christ and that there is only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Scriptures also show us that God through the Holy Spirit dwells in the church and that the Holy Spirit is one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the Scriptures give special attention to the "one Spirit" and the "one Body" 1 Cor 12:12-13; Eph 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also must give our special attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church of Christ is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we only consider it as the church, we may not feel that it matters whether or not there is some division, thinking that little harm is done even though there is a little division here and a little division there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we only consider it as God's people, again it may not matter whether or not there is some division here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we only consider it as God's army, it may not matter whether or not there is some division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, if we only consider it as the house of God, it may be all right if it is divided into several houses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Word of God also tells us that the church of Christ is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With a body, division is absolutely impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot separate three members here and five members there and another two over there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything else in the world can be divided, but not the body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the body is divided, it becomes a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once the church is divided, the world only has the corpse of Christ, not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a serious matter to God when the church is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The children of God cannot be divided, just as the body cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet today, God's children have become insensitive to divisions; they do not consider them as a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please remember, a body cannot be divided!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In nature it is the Body, and one Spirit dwells in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the unity of the church in the Scriptures is the unity of the nature of the Body, which is indivisible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we want to ask one question: Since the Bible shows us that the unity of the church is the unity of the one Holy Spirit dwelling in the one Body, how can it be expressed?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not One Church, but Seven Golden Lampstands</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Roman Catholic Church tells us that since the Body of Christ is one, we should only organize one church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have already seen that this is not the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Scriptures do say that the Body of Christ is one, but they never require the church on the earth to become one like the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Otherwise, the word churches would be a great mistake and the Scriptures should not contain such a term.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot say churches and also say one church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the Scriptures speak of "churches," we know that God has no intention of uniting all the churches on the earth into one church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the apostles in the Bible never organized one church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They established churches in many places, and they established one church in each city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit did not lead them to establish just one church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One worldwide church is only the opinion of the Roman Catholic Church; the unity of Roman Catholicism is manmade, not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us look at the Scriptures again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We see the outward appearance of the church on this earth, which might be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By the outward appearance alone, it may not be easy to understand whether the church on the earth should be many churches or one church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The best way is to go before the Lord and see how the Lord looks at the churches on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This cannot be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Scriptures, the church in each locality has a representative before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the preciousness of Revelation 1 3, which shows us the "seven churches in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This does not mean that only seven churches existed on this earth but that these seven were representative examples.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Revelation 1 3 shows us how the seven churches in Asia were before the Lord in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were seven golden lampstands placed before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The churches on earth may be wrong, entirely wrong, but the churches in heaven, the churches before the throne, the churches before the Lord, cannot be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Saying these churches are wrong is blasphemous and terrible!</S>
