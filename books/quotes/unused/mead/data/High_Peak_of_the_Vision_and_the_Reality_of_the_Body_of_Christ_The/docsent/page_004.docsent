   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After six years Brother Nee resumed his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have published a book recording solely the messages given by Brother Nee during the resumption of his ministry see Messages Given during the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The resumption of his ministry is very deeply related to me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In that book some of the messages were his and some of the messages were mine, and eventually it is difficult to distinguish between them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What was Brother Nee's emphasis in those messages?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Nee's messages, one after another, were on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The problem among us lay in our not having seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In those messages Brother Nee was forced even to speak some very unpleasant words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said that some churches were "native" churches; he also said that some churches were little kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what he said in the resumption of his ministry in June 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In March of that year I went especially to Foochow with several co-workers, including Brother K. H. Weigh, to fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>More than forty co-workers around us also desired to participate in the fellowship, but he refused all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only two brothers, Brother Weigh and I, and two sisters, Peace Wang and Rachel Lee, were given permission to be with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the forty-odd co-workers waited in Foochow, and they asked me, saying, "Brother Lee, no matter what, please put in a word for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We want to hear Brother Nee speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We want to have a part."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Nee said, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was as if I was asking for mercy before him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I said, "Look at all these brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don't you care about them?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were very sorrowful in our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I asked for mercy again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually he said, "Okay, Brother Witness, tell them to come."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His house was quite large with a living room in two sections, an inner room and an outer room.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time he gave his consent, not very willingly, saying, "Okay, ask them to come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only the four of you will fellowship with me here in the inner room, and the rest of them must sit and listen in the outer room."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Nee began to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time I was the only one who spoke; the others would not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I said, "Brother Nee, look at the few dozens of churches here in Fukien Province.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are in confusion and are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What shall we do?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So he began to speak, and that message touched every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then Sister Wang, who was in the outer room, said, "Why don't we practice what you have told us?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After some consideration Brother Nee said, "If you want to practice it, every one of you must hand over himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must hand over everything: hand over yourself, hand over your family, hand over your riches, hand over your church, hand over everything."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was from that time that the practice of handing over began.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was three months before he resumed his ministry and spoke concerning the "native" churches and little kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not too long after these things, he was put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was kept in prison for twenty years, from 1952 to 1972, and eventually he became a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the resumption of his ministry, he still came to take the lead in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then at the end of 1948 the political situation changed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So he called an urgent meeting in Shanghai with a dozen or so leading co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said, "Today I asked you to come here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You all know the world situation is changing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When facing the world situation, how should we handle it?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before anyone said anything, he said, "First, I would like to make a statement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will send Brother Witness abroad."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Afterward, at the conclusion of the meeting, Brother Nee said, "We all will remain here to seek the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord lead us one by one."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He charged me to quickly finish building the big meeting hall in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time we had bought a piece of land for the building of the meeting hall; that was in November.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After another three months Brother Nee called another meeting and gave the same opening word, saying, "I will say this first: We will ask Brother Witness to go abroad."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This time he said that we did not need to seek guidance but should all stay to be sacrificed for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said that of course we should look to the Lord to preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But he was afraid that one day when we would go on and risk our lives, we would all be "captured in one net."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both of the co-workers' meetings were very short and both took place at dusk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While the sisters were preparing dinner for us, I took the opportunity to take a little walk with Brother Nee outside the house.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I said to him sorrowfully, "Brother Nee, why is it that you want only me to go abroad, yet you all are staying here to risk your lives for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is it because I am not worthy?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He turned around and looked at me, saying, "Brother Witness, you have to know that we will risk our lives for the Lord, but I am afraid that one day Satan will capture us in one net.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you go out, and if one day this thing really happens, we will still have something remaining."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can never forget that word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After two months he asked me to hand over everything of the church in Shanghai to the elders and he told me to leave the country.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>So I left.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I first went to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then he was imprisoned for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There was a person who was his prison mate and much younger than he and who was led to salvation in the prison through Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He could be considered a spiritual son of Brother Nee, and he also treated Brother Nee as his father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This brother, whose family name is Wu, got out of the prison first.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Not too long before his death, Brother Nee had told this brother, "After you go out, you should try to find a brother by the name of Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Tell him that I have not abandoned my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you see him, you see me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What he speaks to you, that is my speaking to you."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is what the niece of Brother Nee and her husband, Dr. Kung, heard when they met this Brother Wu in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I can never forget Brother Nee's word to me that "if you go out, we will still have something remaining."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, today if you go to my bedroom, you will notice that there is no other picture in my bedroom except the picture of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Furthermore, there is also a writing by Brother Nee on "Let me love and not be appreciated" hanging on one side of my bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I miss him and I will always miss him.</S>
