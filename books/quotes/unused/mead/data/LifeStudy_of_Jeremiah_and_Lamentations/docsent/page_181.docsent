   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we will first give a word of introduction to our life-study of Lamentations, and then we will consider the first and second lamentations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. INTRODUCTION A. The Writer Jeremiah</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The writer of the book of Lamentations was Jeremiah, the weeping and lamenting prophet cf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2 Chron 35:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. The Subject</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The subject of Lamentations is the expression of Jeremiah s sorrow and love over the holy city and the holy people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. The Contents</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The contents of the book of Lamentations are five lamentations of sorrow and love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. The Sections</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book of Lamentations has five sections: a lamentation over the desolation of the holy city ch.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 ; a lamentation over the destruction of the holy city ch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2 ; a lamentation over the afflicted prophet identified with his punished people ch.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3 ; a lamentation over the punished people ch.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4 ; and a lamentation as a prayer for the holy people as the conclusion of the fourth lamentation ch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is difficult to find anything in Lamentations regarding God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lamentations 3:22-25 does involve God s economy, although not directly but indirectly through God s compassions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to God s dealing with Israel, Israel should have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But Jeremiah said, It is Jehovah s lovingkindness that we are not consumed, / For His compassions do not fail v. 22 . Israel failed, but God s compassions did not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the compassions of God have kept the remnant of Israel on the earth to carry out God s economy, we dare not say that Lamentations has nothing to do with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, there is very little in this book regarding God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God trusted in Jeremiah to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jeremiah was very faithful to God, but between God and Jeremiah there was some discrepancy, some difference.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may say that there was even some friction between them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We see this discrepancy in Jeremiah s reaction to God s punishment of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God was indignant and angry with Israel and came in to tell Jeremiah that He would judge this people to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Jeremiah heard the details concerning Jehovah s governmental dealing with Israel, he began to disagree somewhat with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He thought that God was going too far in His punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, in Jeremiah 15:10 Jeremiah was forced to say, Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that he was not happy about the prophecy that God wanted him to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, Jeremiah found himself in a dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, Jehovah pressed Jeremiah to prophesy concerning Israel s destruction, and Jeremiah felt that the suffering of Israel was too great.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, the people remained evil, and they even began to persecute Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This put Jeremiah into a dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, God carried out His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He destroyed Jerusalem, burned the temple, sent the king into exile, and devastated the entire country.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jeremiah saw all these things take place before his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these things the destruction, devastation, contamination, capture, and ruin remained clearly in the memory of this sorrowful and sympathetic prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By God s sovereignty, Jeremiah was free from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>History tells us that Jeremiah sat on a hill overlooking Jerusalem, viewing all the ruins below.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He began to weep, and he could not avoid writing down his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His five lamentations, written in a very fine way with the first four lamentations following the sequence of the Hebrew alphabet , were the expression of his feeling of sorrow, pain, and sympathy concerning God s holy people, holy land, holy city, holy temple, and holy vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know from the book of Jeremiah that Jeremiah, a good and faithful prophet, was persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was persecuted to such an extent that he prayed, Let me see Your vengeance on them Jer 11:20; 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is contrary to the New Testament teaching, which tells us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, regardless of how good and faithful Jeremiah was, he was still human.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As he walked in the hills above Jerusalem, the more he looked at the destruction, the more the tears came and the more he lamented.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then he wrote his lamentations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us now consider, in the way of a very brief sketch, the first two lamentations.</S>
