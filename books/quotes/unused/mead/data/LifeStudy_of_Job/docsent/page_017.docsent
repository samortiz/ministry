   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A MYSTERIOUS AND GLORIOUS CONSUMMATION A. Satan's Attacks on Job</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Laying a Mysterious and Glorious Base</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan's attacks on Job in two steps laid a mysterious and glorious foundation, or base, for God to accomplish His glorious transformation on Job and for Job to experience the mysterious transactions in his relationship with the mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>B. To Reach the Standard and</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Level of God's Eternal Economy</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>regarding His Chosen Ones</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The mysterious and glorious consummation is that we would reach the standard and level of God's eternal economy regarding His chosen ones, as revealed in the New Testament through the apostle Paul's writings 2 Cor 3:18; Eph 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is very mysterious not only in His person but also in His purpose, in His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, today we have the New Testament, especially the writings of the apostle Paul, who completed the divine revelation Col 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we humble ourselves before God and empty ourselves and if we are poor in spirit, admitting that we have nothing and know nothing concerning God's person, God's purpose, and God's desire, and come to Paul's writings with the help of the Life-study messages, we will see something regarding the divine revelation in a clear, explicit, complete, and impressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In particular, we will see something concerning God's dispensing of Himself in His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ancient book of Job is mysterious, and we need to study it in the light of Paul's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without the Epistles of Paul it would be difficult for us to understand the book of Job because the conclusion of Job does not give us an explicit view concerning the purpose of God's dealing with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in the view of the New Testament, it is very clear that God's purpose in dealing with His holy people is that He desires that they would be emptied of everything and to receive only God as their gain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The desire of God's heart is that we would gain Him in full as life, as the life supply, and as everything to our being.</S>
