<h2 class=head4>b. The Twelve Foundations of the Wall, Built with Every Precious Stone, Bearing the Twelve Names of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb</h2><p>The twelve foundations of the wall, built with every precious stone (vv. 19-20), bear the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (v. 14b), indicating that this precious organic building is built according to the apostles’ teaching of the New Testament and that the New Testament believers are the main constituents of this organic building, to be the consummated section of this building for the building of its main structure for the saints to be built together as God’s eternal enlargement and expression. The twelve tribes of Israel represent the law of the Old Testament, whereas the twelve apostles of the Lamb represent the apostles’ teaching of the New Testament. The gates of the New Jerusalem are the initial section of the building, and the wall is the consummated section.<p>The three items mentioned above—the base with the street, the gates, and the wall with its foundations—show us that this unique, divine, and organic building is a constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, transformed, and glorified people. The first item, the base of the city, is a figure signifying God the Father in His nature. God the Father is the first person of the Trinity. The gates of pearl signify the creation produced by God the Son, who is the second person of the Trinity. The wall and its foundations of precious stones signifies the transforming and building work of the Holy Spirit, who is the third person of the Divine Trinity. Thus, in these first three items we have God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Moreover, on the gates there are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, indicating the Old Testament saints, and on the foundations there are the names of the twelve apostles, signifying the New Testament saints. Hence, we have the Triune God mingled with all the saints, who are God’s redeemed, transformed, and glorified people.<h2 class=head3>4. Its Center with Its Administration and Supply</h2><p>The city of New Jerusalem is built on a golden mountain with gates and with a wall and its foundations. This is the complete building. This consummated building has a center, the throne of God and of the Lamb (22:1). This throne as the center of the city surely is on the top of the city, the top of the golden mountain.<h2 class=head4>a. The Center Being the Throne of God and of the Lamb (the Redeeming Triune God)</h2><p>The center of the city is the throne of God and of the Lamb (the redeeming Triune God). The two, God and the Lamb, signify the redeeming Triune God. The redeeming God is both God and the Lamb.<h2 class=head5>1) Built on the Base (God the Father’s Nature) as Its Foundation</h2><p>The throne signifies the administration of the New Jerusalem. This signifies that the administration of this organic building is built on the base (God the Father’s nature) as its foundation. Psalm 89:14 says that righteousness is the foundation of God’s throne. This implies that the very nature of God as the foundation of God’s administration refers, in this aspect, to God’s attribute of righteousness. God has a nature, and His nature is of many attributes, which include love, light, holiness, righteousness, kindness, etc. All these divine virtues are the attributes of God. Among all these divine attributes, the most important is righteousness. This is why we need to be saved according to God’s righteousness (Rom. 1:16-17; 3:21-22). If we are saved only according to God’s grace or according to God’s love, our salvation is not legally justified; it is not judicial. Anything that is of righteousness is judicial, is legal, according to the law.<p>The foundation of God’s throne is not grace or love. Such a foundation would not be sure to us. God’s throne is established on righteousness as its foundation. This righteousness is the main attribute in God’s nature. In the New Jerusalem both the street and the base are gold, signifying God’s nature in the attribute of righteousness. This is the foundation of the throne of God.<h2 class=head5>2) Joined to the Street</h2><p>The administration of this organic building is also joined to the street, the communication of which, from the throne to the gates, signifies the execution of the administration of this organic building. In the New Jerusalem there is a street that is joined to the throne. The street is for communication. The street joined to the throne is for the governmental dealings, that is, the administration, in the New Jerusalem.
