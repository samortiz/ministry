   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOCKAGE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The spirit requires the soul and the body to be the organs for its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spirit is like the lady of the house, and the steward and servant must carry out the lady's wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit is also like electricity, and there must be a filament before it can express its light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the soul and body are attacked by the evil spirits and become abnormal, the spirit will be blocked and have no outlets.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The enemy knows the importance of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He often works in a believer's soul and body, causing them to lose their function so that the spirit no longer has an organ for its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this, the spirit loses its victorious position.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At such times, the mind may come under attack and become confused.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The emotion may feel lonely and sad, and the will may feel tired and lifeless, unable to direct the person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The body may feel very weak or somewhat lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the believers' soul and body are attacked, and if they do not oppose it right away, their spirit will be blocked; they will not be able to fight vigorously with the enemy and maintain their victorious ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once a believer's spirit is blocked, he loses his vigor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will appear shy or withdrawn, and he will not want to do anything in public.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will prefer to retreat to the rear of the battle line, and he will not want to expose himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may think that this is an enlightenment for him, but actually this is a blockage of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he reads the Bible, he does not seem to have much energy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he prays, he does not seem to have any words to say.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he considers his spiritual work and experience, they seem meaningless and even, at times, silly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he preaches, he does not sense any result and feels that he is only going through the motions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this condition persists, the believer will come under further attack and find himself choked and muffled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will continue unless God intervenes through other men or through his own prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a believer does not have the proper knowledge, he will become very bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Usually he does not try to search for the reason, but instead allows it to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Strictly speaking, every spiritual experience and feeling has a cause to it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should study it carefully and not allow it to remain in us indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such an experience happens when there is a blockage of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The soul and body outside the spirit have been locked up, and the spirit has no chance to express itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan has imprisoned the spirit and locked it up in a dark room so that the soul no longer has the leading of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once the thing that blocks the spirit is removed, the believer will find the outlets cleared, and he will recover his former lightness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very important for a believer at such times to exercise his will to speak aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should speak words of rebuke against the enemy, and he should speak out with a loud voice the victory of the cross and the defeat of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He should single-mindedly oppose the enemy's work in his soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The will must stand behind a person's words and actively reject all blockages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Prayer is another way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Prayer is often the way to remove the blockages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But at these times, one has to pray out loud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best kind of prayer at such a time is to call on the victorious name of the Lord Jesus and withstand all the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One should also exercise his spirit and channel its strength to break open a way to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE POISONING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A believer's spirit can become poisoned by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what the fiery darts of the enemy do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He can shoot his darts directly into a believer's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He can shoot sorrow, sadness, suffering, grief, and heartbreak into a believer's spirit, causing him to have a "sorrowful spirit" 1 Sam 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"But a wounded spirit who can bear?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Prov 18:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, this greatly affects a person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a believer feels sorrowful, he thinks he is feeling sorrowful, considering this sorrow to be very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He does not try to find out its cause nor does he try to oppose it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He accepts everything that comes to him silently and without any objection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to remember that this is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can never accept a thought carelessly or allow any feeling to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we want to walk according to the spirit, we have to be watchful in everything; we must study all our thoughts and feelings and find out where they come from.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes Satan causes our spirit to become hard, stubborn, narrow, selfish, wild, and disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consequently, the spirit is not able to cooperate with the Holy Spirit and carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will lose all of our love for men and all of our gentleness, sympathy, and considerations for the weaknesses of others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When this happens, the Holy Spirit cannot use us to any great extent; we will have lost the Lord's broadness and set up a boundary for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes the enemy puts an unforgiving spirit into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the most frequent poison that believers take in. This probably accounts for the majority of the cases of failure in spiritual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This kind of poison, such as fastidiousness and vengeance, is the most deadly poison to the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even after a believer has suffered from this poison, most of the time he will still not be clear about what happened or realize that this poison came from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, he thinks that he hates others and that this cannot be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes Satan causes believers to become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He will cause believers to set a boundary for themselves and separate themselves from others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If believers do not have the concept of the church being the Body of Christ, instead making their own little group their foremost concern, it is a sign that their spirit has dwindled and become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A spiritual believer considers God's business as his own business and the whole church as the object of his love.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If his spirit is open, the river of life will flow everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if he becomes narrow, he will frustrate God's work and minimize his own usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If our spirit is not big enough to include all of God's children, it means that our spirit has been poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sometimes Satan causes the believers' spirit to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way they become boastful, self-respecting, and self-esteeming.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Satan causes the believers to think that they are not destitute, that they are somewhat important, and that they have some worth in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This kind of spirit is also a great cause for the believers' failures.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"Pride goeth before destruction,/and a haughty spirit before a fall" Prov 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The evil spirits inject such things together with other poisons into the believers' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the believers do not oppose these things immediately, they will quickly turn into things of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If believers know how to live in the spirit, these things will only be Satan's poison at the beginning; they will not have an opportunity to become a sin of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, if believers do not oppose them, subconsciously accepting them instead, they will soon turn into sins of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the spirit is poisoned, and the poison is not quickly dealt with, it will turn into sins in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Sins in the spirit are more serious than any other sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But turning, He rebuked them and said, You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" Luke 9:54-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The kind of spirit we have is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many times our spirit is stirred up by Satan, and we do not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once the spirit errs, everything else errs.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we consider the experience of the two disciples, we can see that a wrong spirit is very easily detected in our words.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, the words probably do not reveal as much as one's tone of voice.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many times the words may be right, but the tone is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we want to overcome, we have to take care of the tone in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Once evil spirits touch our spirit, our tone will lose its gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All harsh voices, rash voices, and sharp voices do not come from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Rather, they are a sign that the ones with these voices have already been stirred up by Satan's poisons.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>How do we ordinarily speak?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When we speak about others, can we speak without any sense of condemnation?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Perhaps what we say is true, but a spirit of criticism, condemnation, wrath, and jealousy may be lurking behind truthful words.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should speak the truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If our spirit is pure and meek, we can speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But if a spirit of condemnation is lurking behind our words, we are committing a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Sin is not only an act, but also a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The spirit behind all of our actions is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many times we can be working for God or man and committing sins at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The work may be done, but a spirit of dishonesty, unwillingness, or grudge is hidden behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should maintain our spirit in a sweet and tender condition.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Our spirit should be clean and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Do we consider a wrong spirit a sin?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When does the enemy attack our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When is our spirit poisoned?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we know about sins, will we remove them humbly?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>When we detect a hardening of our tone, we should immediately stop and not go on.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We should immediately say to others, "I would rather say the same words with a clean spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I would rather oppose the enemy."</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If we are not willing to tell our brothers that we are wrong, our spirit retains its sins.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Believers should learn to guard their spirit from the provocation of the enemy and to guard their spirit in sweetness and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Ordinarily a believer should have the shield of faith for the quenching of the flaming darts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This means that he should exercise a living faith to oppose the attacks of the enemy and should trust in God's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Faith is our shield; it is not our extracting pliers.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is for quenching the fiery darts, not for pulling them out.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If believers are hit by the darts, they should immediately remove the cause of the fiery darts and take up an opposing stand.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They should immediately reject everything from the enemy and pray for God's cleansing.</S>
