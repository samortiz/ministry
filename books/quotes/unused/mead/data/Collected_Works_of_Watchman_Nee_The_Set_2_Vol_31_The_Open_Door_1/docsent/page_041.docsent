   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Yuan-Jiang, Hunan Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I never thought that I would come to Yuan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I had never even heard of Yuan-Jiang, much less considered coming here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, things happened that we did not even dream of.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was originally going to go to Chi-Li, but instead I ended up here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I will explain briefly how it happened to comfort you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We left Hankow on the evening of December 16 and arrived in Cheng-Ling-Ji at noon on the eighteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our cargo had to be inspected by the customs officers, so our boat did not leave Cheng-Ling-Ji until the morning of the twentieth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We went to Lin-Tze-Kou on the twenty-first.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The captain said that the boat was not going to Shatow, so he hired another local boat for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The boat went slowly because the water level was so low.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We did not arrive in Yuan-Jiang until the morning of the twenty-third.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We originally planned to take the next steamer to Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the beginning we stayed in a hostel, but later we discussed this with the people from the denominational church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thank the Lord, we were given hospitality by them so that we could settle here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Pastor Hsu Wei invited us to preach the word three times.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The audience said they were very touched.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May all the glory be to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Han was too exhausted by the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After coming to Yuan-Jiang he got the flu.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ninety percent of the people had the flu.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fortunately, he is better now.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Pastor Hsu says that they can give us hospitality until the middle of February because their chapel will be holding their annual Bible study then.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rent is higher than usual because many refugees have come to Yuan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I had originally planned to write you a letter telling you everything, but I was not able to because of my health.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please greet Brother Chou, Brother Chu, and all the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Chang Gun-jih</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Dear Brother Lan in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did you receive my last two airmail letters?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I think of you often.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The day after Brother Hsi-wen mailed his letter, he bought the tickets to K'un-ming through the Lord's marvelous arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Jing-yuan took his sister to Yunnan on the twenty-eighth of last month.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Miss Hsu En-shiu's entire family went to Kweilin at the end of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sister Shen Hwei-min went to Hong Kong at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most of the brothers and sisters passing through along the way have all scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I received Brother Hsien-lu's letter yesterday that said Brother Han has arrived in Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise the victorious Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He really guides in marvelous ways!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Feng said that there is a meeting in his home on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are now asking the Lord to prepare a proper meeting hall for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have been very busy since Gan-mu sent a letter with his date of arrival; I have been preparing his house for him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I really need your help in prayer for the two matters mentioned in the previous two letters!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I will tell you the rest in detail later.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope for your answer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Best blessings!</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Yu-zhi in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After we said good-by, I think that the Lord must have specially protected, led, and used you to do the work that pleases His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not know whether you received the card I sent last time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I came to Ch'ang-Teh to escape from the war and met Brother Han Fu-sheng.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are now asking the Lord to give us an open door for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I married Sister Ma Ru-xun on December 27 of last year, according to the Lord's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have now started a small school in Ch'ang-Teh to maintain our livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am still not clear about the Lord's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I feel that someone like me will never be worthy to do God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, I deeply believe that if the Lord wants to use someone, that person will be able to obey the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God is not a respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As we were escaping from the war, we saw His glory all along the way.</S>

   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are now asking the Lord to make arrangements for these five students.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Perhaps they can follow the footsteps of Brother Han.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The result of this war is that many brothers and sisters have become scattered and lost.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They really need God's special grace to preserve their spirits, souls, and bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Did you go to Kuei-yang?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If there are any letters for my wife or myself at your place, please send them in care of Brother Feng Hsien-luh, Tung-Gong Print Shop, Court Main Street, Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I will stop right here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many blessings in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
