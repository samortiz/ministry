   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An altar is for consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Probably all of you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But where was that consecration at Shechem or at Bethel?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was that an experience of El-elohe-Israel or of El-Bethel?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before I came into the church life I had consecrated myself more than once.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the consecration I made after coming into the church life was much higher than any previous consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My consecration before the church life was only for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was for me to be holy, spiritual, victorious, and acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But my consecration after coming into the church life was different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you live individualistically, you do not need very much consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After you get married, however, you find that your spouse is a troublemaker and that you need to consecrate yourself for this new situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say to the Lord, "Lord, before getting married, I consecrated myself to You to be holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now that I am married I must consecrate myself to You for this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I like the windows opened, but my wife wants them closed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I need a consecration to match this situation."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This consecration is new and different.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, you have children, and this requires a further consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you come into the church life, you not only have one troublemaker but hundreds of them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many are afraid to come to Anaheim, thinking that it is too large and that the elders here are so strong and straight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They prefer to go to a smaller locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that when we come into the church life we need a greater and greater consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you get married, you need a consecration; when you have children, you need a greater consecration; and when you come into the church life, especially to the church in Anaheim, you need the greatest consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the topmost consecration, you could not bear the church life in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may say to yourself, "Oh, how difficult it is here in Anaheim!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are policemen' everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I simply cannot adapt to this situation."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since you cannot adjust to it, you must build an altar to match it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we all know, in front of the temple there was an altar, and no one could enter into the temple without first lingering at the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must stop at the altar and offer yourself, putting yourself on the altar to be slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then, after you have been resurrected, you will be free to enter into the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the significance of an altar?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An altar is for slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have said, "The church life is good, but I cannot stand those leading brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others have said, "I appreciate the church life, but I cannot bear the leading sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are too holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their holiness slaughters me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where then should you go back to Shechem or Padan-aram?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have no alternative except to climb on the altar at Bethel and be slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The altar in Shechem is an individual altar, but the altar in El-Bethel is a corporate altar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the altar of the house of God, and you must present yourself upon it for the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have done this many times and, years ago, I was slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now, no one can offend me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You cannot offend anyone who has been slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you do not take in this word and build an altar at El-Bethel, you will not remain in the church forever.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day, you will either walk away or become indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you are happy, you will come to the meetings, but when you are unhappy, you will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that the church is the church, that you are you, and that you and the church have nothing to do with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you do not become indifferent, you will leave because you have been offended.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is full of offenders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I was slaughtered long ago for the church life in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, none of you can slaughter me anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I cannot be offended by you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the experience of the altar built at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you can still be offended, it means that, although you may have an altar in Shechem, you do not have an altar in Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have an altar in Bethel means to have a consecration for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You need to purposely and specifically offer yourself to the Lord for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you do this, you will never be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, you will be prepared for trials, tests, and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need such an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the experience at Bethel, the experience of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you read chapters twenty-eight through thirty-five again, paying attention to this matter of the altar, you will notice the progression from no altar to the highest altar, the altar at El-Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need a definite, specific consecration for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to say, "Lord, now I would make a thorough and specific consecration to You, not that I might be holy, spiritual, or victorious, but that I might experience Your house and remain in it."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul said to Timothy, "If I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to experience God in His house and to behave in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This requires a definite consecration and a special altar.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The common, ordinary altar that we experienced in the past will not be adequate for this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need the topmost consecration at the altar in Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the past centuries, a number of books have been put out by Christian teachers on the subject of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But, as far as I know, none of them tells Christians to consecrate themselves for the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Mrs. Hannah W. Smith's famous book, The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, places great stress on the matter of consecration, but it is only for a happy Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She even considers consecration to be a secret of the happy Christian life, but she says nothing for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Keswick Convention, with which Mrs. Smith had much to do, also emphasized consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Actually, in the early days, the messages given at the Keswick Convention were focused on consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, as far as I know, nothing was mentioned regarding consecration for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In nearly every revival in Christianity consecration is stressed, but one can hardly hear of the consecration for the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because Christians have not seen the church life, all their altars are, at best, built in "Shechem."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But in the Lord's recovery today we must build our altar at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need the topmost consecration for the church life to fulfill God's eternal purpose and to satisfy His heart's desire.</S>
