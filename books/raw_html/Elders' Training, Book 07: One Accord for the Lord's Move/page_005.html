<h2 class="head1">FORGETTING ABOUT OUR OLD WAY<br />
TO IMPROVE OUR PRACTICE</h2>
<p>We need to forget about our own way and our old way. I was once in this old way. I brought this way to Taiwan and to the United States, but now this way is too old. I am not contradicting myself but improving myself. The airplane manufacturers manufactured the DC-4 between 1947 and 1948. I traveled on a DC-4 when China first began to use it. When I first came to the United States, it took me over twenty-four hours from Taiwan. Today I can make this trip in less than twelve hours on a DC-10. Today, we have to forget about the DC-4 because we have the DC-10. This improved aircraft is by the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>We cannot change the globe, but we can improve our means of transportation around the globe. We cannot change the truth either, but we can improve our practice. Our practice in the past concerning the way to meet was somewhat influenced by the traditional way. We were born into and surrounded by traditional things which are hard for us to drop. The fact that we need to be asked by someone in the church meeting to read the Scriptures is not a good indication. Why would anyone of us not read the verses on the board spontaneously? Perhaps we are in our tradition, waiting for an assistant pastor to lead us in the Scripture reading. In the new move which is the up-to-date move of the Lord, we like to go back one thousand percent to the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE ACCORD IN ROMANS,<br />
1 AND 2 CORINTHIANS, AND PHILIPPIANS</h2>
<p>The one accord revealed in the New Testament is a great matter. This is why Paul indicated to the saints in Rome that they had to take care of being in one accord (Rom. 15:5-6). There were many troubles in the church in Corinth, and the real factor of all these troubles was dissension. Some said that they were of Paul and appreciated him. Others said that they were of Apollos and probably appreciated his way to teach the Bible. Still others appreciated Peter (1 Cor. 1:12). This is disaccord, dissension. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Corinthians has more problems in it than any other of his Epistles. There are at least ten problems in 1 Corinthians which all came out of the same source of disaccord, having different opinions and not speaking the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10).</p>
<p>In Corinthians Paul did not use the word one accord, but he did stress speaking the same thing. For one person to say that he is of Paul and another to say that he is of Apollos indicates that they are not speaking the same thing. We all have to say, &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo; To say &ldquo;I am of Paul&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Apollos&rdquo; is just like Peter on the mount of transfiguration saying that he would make three tabernacles&mdash;one for Moses, one for Elijah, and one for Jesus. Then a voice came out of the cloud which overshadowed them: &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him! And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them, except Jesus only&rdquo; (Mark 9:7-8). We all need to speak the same thing. Why should Paul, Apollos, and Cephas be mentioned? This is why Paul asked the Corinthians, &ldquo;Has Christ been divided?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:13). In Paul&rsquo;s second Epistle to the church in Corinth he also charged them to &ldquo;think the same thing&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:11). In his letter to the Philippians Paul likewise charged the saints to think the same thing (2:2; 4:2).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL NEED TODAY&mdash;<br />
THE RECOVERY OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>If you are going to do something to follow what the Lord has been doing and is still doing in Taiwan, the first thing you must do is to recover the one accord. Before this is recovered, do not do anything else. Without the one accord you are altogether not qualified to do anything in the Lord&rsquo;s new start of His new move. The Lord&rsquo;s church, His Body, His testimony, has been altogether cut into pieces by the Christians through the centuries not being in one accord. Many know the Lord and know the Bible to some extent, but they would not be in one accord. Where is the one accord? It is hard to see such a thing in Christian history, so the Lord has suffered.</p>
<p>Today we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and especially we are in His new move, His up-to-date move. We must see that the crucial need today is the recovery of this one accord. If this is not among us, we are through. Then you may say that the Lord will go to others, but it is hard for Him to go to others. The ancient Chinese did not like either the soldiers or the police, so they had a proverb which basically said, &ldquo;If you leave the soldiers and come to the policeman, what is the difference?&rdquo; The two are about the same. For the Lord to leave &ldquo;the soldier&rdquo; and go to &ldquo;the policeman&rdquo; is about the same. Where could the Lord go then? In a sense, the Lord becomes &ldquo;pitiful&rdquo; because of us. He has nowhere to go, and He has come to us. He has been &ldquo;pitiful&rdquo; for years.</p>
<p>There was some kind of morale among us, but it has been nearly lost. We have many good teachings, we have the ground of the church, and we have all the divine provisions, but our morale is a problem. What is the problem? The problem is that we have nearly lost the one accord. Among the churches there is the lack of one accord. Even among the elders in one church, there is the lack of one accord. Among the saints in one locality there is also the lack of one accord. It is the same among the co-workers. Everywhere there is a lack of one accord. We say that we all are in the recovery, we are for the recovery, and we are with the ministry. We say this, but this may just be our slogan. Where is the one accord?</p>
<p>The one accord is the need. Do not think about others concerning this matter of the one accord. Think about yourself, your share, your portion in this matter. We do not have much morale because we are lacking the one accord, yet we still want to practice the things that the Lord has shown us in His recovery. We may practice them, yet with no impact, no livingness, and in other words, without much fruit.</p>
<p>From 1970 to 1972 the migration of the saints to new places had the impact, but not today. I am quite concerned for the recent migrations to other cities. Do they have the one accord there or not? If we do not have the one accord, whether or not we migrate makes little difference. If there is no morale, to have an army or not to have an army makes little difference. What makes an army different is its morale. Do we have the morale in the church in our locality? Those of you who migrated to another place must ask yourselves if you have the one accord. If not, you have destroyed your migration. You will waste your time in being there. To have the home gatherings without the one accord means nothing. To go out to visit others to distribute the booklets needs the one accord. Without the one accord, all our doings will be in vain.</p>
<p>We must realize that the practices in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not matters for others to copy. You must have the life. To do anything you need the life. You have to see what the landmark was of the one hundred twenty in the book of Acts. The landmark that divides the Gospels and the Acts was not the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The landmark was the one accord of the one hundred twenty. If you want to experience the baptism in the Spirit, you must have the one accord. If all the members of a local church have the one accord, the baptism in the Spirit will be there. If you really want to practice the proper way to preach the gospel, you need the one accord. Without this key, no door can be opened. The one accord is the &ldquo;master key to all the rooms,&rdquo; the master key to every blessing in the New Testament. This is why Paul told Euodias and Syntyche that they needed this one accord (Phil. 4:2). Paul knew that these sisters loved the Lord, but that they had lost the one accord.</p>
<p>What we need is to recover this one accord. If we mean business to go along with the Lord&rsquo;s present day move, we need this one accord. Who is right does not mean anything; we need this one accord. We need to have the same mind and the same will for the same purpose with the same soul and the same heart. Philippians tells us that this matter starts from our spirit (1:27), yet we must realize we are not persons of spirit only. We are persons also of the mind, will, purpose, soul, and heart. For us to be in the same one spirit with the same one soul, one mind, and one will is to have the one accord, which is the key to all the New Testament blessings and bequests. Otherwise, we will repeat the pitiful history of Christianity by being another group of Christians repeating the same kind of disaccord.</p>
