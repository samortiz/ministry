   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Resting and Enjoying</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we saw that Isaac inherited grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With him, everything was a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was born in grace, was grown up in grace, and was made an heir of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we need to see that with Isaac there was also the matter of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His life was a resting and enjoying life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The record of Isaac's life does not indicate that he suffered much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it reveals that he was always resting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is proved by his meditating in the field 24:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Could Isaac have meditated if he had not been quiet and restful?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No. In order to meditate we must be restful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we are troubled, we are unable to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaac was always resting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Genesis 24, he had lost his mother, did not have a wife, and his servant had gone away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet, he was not troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He went to the field to meditate, not to cry out to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not say, "O Lord, what should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have lost my mother, I do not have a wife, and my servant has gone away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, have mercy upon me!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaac did not cry out in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, he meditated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we cannot find the word resting in the record of Isaac's life, the fact is there nonetheless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaac was a very restful person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In spite of the troubles he encountered with the Philistines over the wells, he was always at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although Isaac faced some troubles, he himself was not troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While the Philistines were contending for the wells, he remained restful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaac seemed to be saying, "If you don't want me to stay here at this well, then I'll go elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you come to bother me there, I'll go to still another place."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this we see that Isaac was truly a restful person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you always restful?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consider your experience during the past twenty-four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did anything bother you and cause you to lose your rest?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most of us would have to admit that we have been troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows that although we are Isaacs, we are not always resting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Recently I was doing some difficult and exhausting work on the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I can praise the Lord that as I was working, I was very restful and I could say, "I have nothing and I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need for me to do anything, because the Lord is doing it all."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need to be restful people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Isaac was not only resting; he was also enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His entire life was a life of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he was old, he still had the taste for "savoury meat" and asked Esau to go out to the field and prepare him the meat which he loved 27:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Rebekah heard this, she called Jacob to fetch her two kids of the goats that she might prepare the meat for Isaac 27:5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, after both Jacob and Esau had come with meat for their father, Isaac got a double portion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Esau, Rebekah, and Jacob were busy, but Isaac just sat there enjoying the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By this we see that Isaac was an enjoying person, always enjoying the provision of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This enjoyment was his destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Enjoyment is also our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Young brothers, do not worry about finding a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you remain restful and full of enjoyment, the best wife will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our Christian life there is the aspect of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have been striving since I was twelve years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now, after almost sixty years, I can testify that many times my striving has frustrated the coming of the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I had not striven, the enjoyment would have come much earlier and in a richer way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why does striving frustrate the enjoyment?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because enjoyment is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all have been predestinated for it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Young brothers, forget about your striving.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Simply go home, pray, praise, and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The next morning rise up, have a good morning watch, and eat a hearty breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not worry about finding a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rebekah will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the enjoyment which is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Are we not the sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How can the sons of God be pitiful people?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must declare, "Praise the Lord that I am a son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The almighty, all-sufficient God is my Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The word father denotes a rich provision.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As long as we have a rich father, we have the provision and have no need to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should simply enjoy this bountiful provision.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is our destiny.</S>
