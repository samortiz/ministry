In this book we have not only the acts of the apostles and disciples, but also the acts of the resurrected and ascended Christ
In Romans we have not only the teachings concerning the Christian life and the church life, but also the principles
Not many Christian teachers realize that what is revealed in Romans in the way of a sketch is fully illustrated in 1 Corinthians
Some of the Brethren teachers have said that 1 Corinthians was written to solve a number of serious problems in the church
Those from a Pentecostal or charismatic background may emphasize the socalled gifts in 1 Corinthians especially tonguesspeaking and healing
The book of 1 Corinthians is not mainly concerned with problems in the church or with spiritual gifts or miracles
Please be impressed with the fact that this book gives us an illustration of the Christian life, church life, and Body life
The point here is that in a very real sense the Corinthians illustrate the usual, or typical, Christian life, church life, and Body life
Just as there were divisions among the saints in Corinth, so there are divisions among believers in the churches today
It illustrates three categories of spiritual life: the individual Christian life, the corporate church life, and the organic Body life
The actual situation among the believers and in the churches, both at Paul's time and today, has many negative elements
It certainly is difficult to find any local church where the situation is entirely free from negative elements
May we all see clearly that 1 Corinthians is an illustration of our own Christian life, church life, and Body life
In this book of illustration the focus is on Christ but not first on Christ as the lifegiving Spirit in resurrection but on Christ crucified
If we would understand 1 Corinthians, we must know what are the initial gifts and what are the developed gifts
In chapter one we do not see the developed gifts, gifts which come from the growth of life, but only the initial gifts
Paul says, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
The main points in 1:1-9 are the apostle, the church, the saints, the initial gifts, and the fellowship of Christ
Corinthians 1:1 says, 'Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother'
It is worthwhile to compare the way Paul refers to his apostleship in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus with what he says in 1 Corinthians
In 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul says that he was an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God and of Christ Jesus
That Paul was a called apostle indicates that he was not selfselected or selfappointed that his apostleship was not initiated from himself
Paul was called according to God's will and under God's administration to carry out God's New Testament economy
It was written to 'the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints'
The expression 'the church of God' indicates that the church has the nature of God, that it is constituted of the element of God
If we have only the local aspect, but not the aspect of the church being of God, we shall have only an outward formality
On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality
In their writings, some may speak concerning the church of God, and others may say something about the church being in Corinth
We need to be impressed that the description of the church in 1:2 includes the two aspects of the church, the universal and the local
When someone asks you to what church you belong, you should say that you belong to the church of God in your particular locality
Verse 2 says, 'To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints'
According to grammar, 'to the church of God' is in apposition to 'to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus'
The expression 'called saints' indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called to be saints
It is in the Word that Paul describes them as those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus and called saints
Paul does not say that the Corinthians were sanctified in themselves; he declares that they had been sanctified in Christ Jesus
When Balaam prophesied concerning them, he declared, 'He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel'
In verse 2 Paul says, by the use of another appositive, that those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus are called saints
Some of us may have the confidence only to say that we are believers, but not the assurance to say that we are saints
The reason for this lack of assurance is that the evil influence from Catholicism still affects our understanding
Others, aware of failures like losing their temper or quarreling with their spouse, may not have the confidence to say that they are saints
In verse 2 Paul also says, 'With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours'
As we have seen, it indicates that a local church includes only those in that particular locality, not all the saints on earth
In the opening verses of this Epistle, Paul gives us the definition of an apostle, of the church, and of the saints
We have pointed out that a saint is a person who has been called by God and who calls on the name of the Lord Jesus
All believers should be focused on Him, not distracted by any gifted person, any overemphasis on doctrine, or any particular practice
In verse 3 we have Paul's greeting to the Corinthians: 'Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ'
Grace is God as our enjoyment , and peace is a condition which results from grace, issuing from the enjoyment of God our Father
In verse 4 Paul says, 'I give thanks to God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus'
The Corinthian believers were not lacking in the initial gifts in life, but they were desperately short of the growth in life
However much they were initially enriched in grace, they were still infants in Christ, soulish, fleshly, and even fleshy
To speak of these gifts as initial gifts indicates that these gifts have not yet developed; they have not yet grown to maturity
The growth of a plant from a seed to a mature plant illustrates the growth and development of the initial gifts
The Corinthian believers all had the initial gifts; they all had the divine life and the Holy Spirit sown into them as seeds
Like the Corinthians, we philosophical ones have been enriched in our understanding concerning spiritual things
Because they were cultured, educated, and philosophical, they could understand the words which conveyed the thought of Paul's ministry
In verse 8 Paul says, 'Who will also confirm you till the end, unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ'
A saint not only has been called by God and calls on the name of the Lord, but he also has a certain inner confirmation
In this book Brother Nee says that in the Bible God clearly tells us that as long as we believe in Christ, we are saved
Having considered the various matters related to being a saint, we all should be clear that we are truly saints
In verse 9 Paul says, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
In His faithfulness He will confirm the believers till the end, making them unreprovable in the day of the Lord's return
God has called us into such a fellowship that we may partake of Christ, participate in Him, and enjoy Him as our God-given portion
We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God that all the problems among the believers may be solved
Fellowship does not merely mean that there is communication between you and someone else; it also denotes participation in that one
We have been called into a mutuality in which we enjoy what the Son of God is, and in which we are one with Him and He is one with us
In verse 2 Paul says, 'With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours'
Whenever you need to discuss something concerning the church, do you not prefer to go to the elder of your choice?
Our unique center is the Lord who is both theirs and ours, the Son of God into whose fellowship we all have been called of God
God has one center-Jesus Christ-and He has called you not into the denomination of your choice, but into the fellowship of His Son
Concerning these three kinds of lives, this Epistle illustrates what is actual or typical, not what is normal or proper
God's intention is to make Christ His Son the center of His economy and also to make Him everything to all the believers
In His economy God's intention is to make Christ everything, to give Christ to us as our portion, and also to work Christ into us
He beseeches them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names and should be the unique name among all His believers
When the Corinthians believed in Christ, they did not receive anything from Paul, Apollos, or any other servant of God
The mutuality of this fellowship is not only between the believers and the Triune God, but also among the believers themselves
Because we have been called into such a fellowship, we should not say that we are of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, or of any other person
Would it not be marvelous if all of today's Christians realized that they had been called into this fellowship?
As we pointed out in the Life-study of Colossians, in the church as the new man, Christ must be everything and everyone
No matter where you may be when you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, Christ is both yours and also the portion of all the saints
Your attention must be focused solely, wholly, and absolutely on Christ, the One into whose fellowship we have been called by God'
We should not prefer our local church above others, or some other local church above the church in our locality
We should be content to simply be in the church in the place where God has put us according to His sovereign arrangement
If the wind of the Spirit blows you to a certain locality, you should simply be in the church there, without any preference
If after a period of time the spiritual wind blows you to another city, you should be equally content to be in the church there
We should not have the concept that we can enjoy Christ more in a particular locality than we can somewhere else
We should not think, for example, that we can enjoy more of Christ in that place where the ministry may be located
Even a region such as Southern California, a place people consider an entertainment center, would be subdued by us
It is to recover Christ as the unique center of God's economy and as everything to us as our portion for our enjoyment
We should drop the names of any persons or servants of God whom we may prefer, and we should also lay aside all denominational names
We must turn from all doctrines and practices and take Christ, the unique center of God's economy, as our everything
In dealing with all these problems, Paul makes it very clear that the unique solution to all problems in the church is Christ and His cross
With 1:1-9 as a good foundation, we can begin to appreciate Christ and the cross as the unique solution to all problems in the church
In the foregoing message we pointed out that Christ and His cross are the unique solution to all problems in the church
Paul goes on to say that there cannot be circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or freeman
Afterwards, directly in front of the cathedral there was a clash between members of these different racial groups
What a shame that such a confrontation could take place after a meeting which was supposedly held in the name of Christ!
In the church as the new man there are no distinctions on the basis of color; there is no white, black, red, brown, or yellow
He could say, 'I wish to testify that Christ is everything and that in the new man there cannot be Jew and Greek
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
In a sense, every locality should be lowered down in our estimation so that we may uplift Christ, our unique portion
Neither in the Gospel of John nor in the Epistle to the Colossians do we have the aspects of Christ which are itemized in 1 Corinthians
In 27 Paul says But we speak Gods wisdom in a mystery the wisdom which has been hidden which God predestined before the ages for our glory
In 3:11 Paul says, 'For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ'
As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church
The rock smitten in Exodus 17:6 is a type of Christ smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life and to satisfy our thirst
Even though we have Christ in us, if we do not experience Him as the Spirit, there is no way for us to experience Christ
The key to experiencing Christ in all these aspects consists in the fact that He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit
We have pointed out again and again that in 1:9 Paul says that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
According to 1 Corinthians we have Christ in nineteen aspects, including the aspect of His being the all-inclusive Spirit
Christ is the unique center of God's economy, He is the unique portion of all the saints, and He is the all-inclusive One to be our all
After pointing out many aspects of His riches, Paul declares that this Christ has become the life-giving Spirit
In the first message in this Lifestudy we saw that 1 Corinthians is an illustration of the Christian life the church life and the Body life
We should turn from considering the names of persons and places and concentrate on the unique name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
We need to have a proper understanding concerning the cross, realizing that the purpose of the cross is to terminate whatever we are
He beseeches them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names and should be the unique name among all His believers
In dealing with all the problems in the church at Corinth, the apostle's ax first touches the root, that is, the divisions among them
The first virtue of the walk worthy of God's calling is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit in the Body of Christ
These verses indicate that divisions among Christians always result from placing another name above the name of the Lord Jesus
When certain of the Corinthians said, 'I am of Apollos,' they automatically uplifted the name of Apollos above the name of Christ
Today believers commonly designate themselves as Lutherans, Presbyterians, or Baptists without any sense of shame
It is a shame for a Christian to call himself a Lutheran, for this means that he places the name of Luther above the name of Christ
They have no feeling of shame when they designate themselves by a particular name other than the name of Christ
It is beautiful to see the genuine oneness between Chinese and Japanese believers and also between German and French believers
Because the Lord has raised us up to carry out His recovery, we focus our attention on Christ and not on any practices
That refers to a baptism which is one in nature or in kind, not to the practice of baptizing a believer one time
Should someone come to you and criticize the way of meeting and propose another way, you should reply, 'I don't care to talk about this
The best way to silence the gossiping tongue is not to respond when someone seeks to turn you from Christ to other things
Do not discuss the meetings, whether they are high or low, and do not talk about the church, whether it is good or bad
Our attitude should be that we care only for Christ, for the church of God in every place, and for the Lord's recovery
Do not think that if a certain church is healthy, it is the church, but that it is no longer the church if its condition becomes unhealthy
If we see the church in the Lord's recovery in this way and care only for Christ as our unique center, we shall not have any divisions
Whether or not we are secure in the recovery and protected from divisiveness depends on the vision we have seen
It means to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly together
The testimony of the church in Corinth had been severely damaged, and Paul wrote this Epistle to mend this situation
When you have seen the all-inclusive Christ and have learned the secret of enjoying Him, your way of thinking and speaking will be changed
Suppose you come into the meeting hall and the chairs are arranged in a very unusual way, altogether contrary to your preference
If you complain about the arrangement of the chairs and are distracted by it this proves that you have not seen the vision concerning Christ
Divine diamonds are available to you in the meeting of the church, but you are distracted from the diamonds by the arrangement of the chairs
You will not care for the arrangement of the chairs, for you will come to the meetings for Christ and Christ alone
The only way to be rescued from this divisiveness is to see the all-inclusive Christ and learn the secret of enjoying Him
Their conversation indicates that they did not have a proper view and that they have not been fully rescued from their divisive nature
Of caring for Christ, they are interested in the way the elders manage the church or in the way the young people are going on
You will be one who has learned the secret, who speaks the same thing, and who has the same mind and the same opinion
Brother Watchman Nee once told us that what is most important and precious in reading the Bible is to touch the spirit of the writer
Because of his absoluteness for Judaism, he was opposed to the gospel, to the name of Jesus, and to the church
On a particular journey of ministry he visited the city of Corinth, a cultured city in Greece, where many philosophical people lived
Some of the philosophical Greeks in Corinth received the word of Paul's preaching, accepted Christ, and were saved
They lived according to their philosophy and worldly wisdom, not according to the divine life and the Holy Spirit
Some said that a brother should leave his wife if she was not willing to go along with him to believe in the Lord
Even though they were genuine Christians who had received the divine gifts, they were not living a Christian life, but living a Greek life
As Paul was writing this Epistle, he was burdened to guide the distracted, philosophical Christians in Corinth back to Christ
The main point in these chapters is that in his spirit Paul was endeavoring to bring the distracted philosophical believers back to Christ
The crucifixion of Christ has silenced the entire universe and simplified the extremely complicated situation in the universe
Deep in his spirit, Paul was yearning to impress the distracted, philosophical Christians in Corinth with this crucified Christ
Many voices were speaking different things: 'I am of Apollos,' 'I am of Cephas,' 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Christ'
In Paul's spirit was the burden to bring the believers back to the Christ whom he had preached to them and testified to them
God's saving power is not a strong Christ but a crucified Christ, not a fighting Christ but a defeated Christ'
In 1:17 Paul said that he preached the gospel 'not in wisdom of speech, that the cross of Christ should not be made void'
According to the philosophy of the Greeks, Paul's preaching of a crucified Christ was neither logical nor philosophical
Writing with such a spirit, Paul pointed the believers to the crucified Christ and spoke to them the word of the cross
He told them that Christ crucified is the power of God for saving us and the wisdom of God for fulfilling His plan
Verse 18 says, 'For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God'
The cross of Christ abolished the ordinances of the law , and we the believers have died to philosophy, an element of the world
Satan instigated the Judaizers and philosophers to preach their isms of worldly wisdom that the cross of Christ might be made void
Paul did not want the cross of Christ to be made void through preaching in wisdom of speech, that is, in philosophical speculations
You do not realize that God will destroy the wisdom of the wise and set aside the understanding of the prudent
It is dangerous to regard yourselves as wise or prudent, for you run the risk of being destroyed by God or of being set aside by Him'
It is common for those with a certain national or cultural background to regard themselves as the most wise and philosophical of people
The leading ones in certain places may pride themselves in thinking that the young people under their training are scribes and disputers
God is pleased through the foolishness of the preaching, the message, the thing preached, to save those who believe
According to our opinion, he should have exercised his knowledge to put forth excellent words of philosophical speculation
He used simple and brief expressions, expressions which may have been regarded as foolishness by philosophical Greeks
As a result, we have the assurance that they believe not in our excellency of speech, but in Christ and the cross as preached by us
When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, the Jews mocked Him and said, 'You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself!
They challenged the Lord to prove that He was the Christ, the Son of God, by delivering Himself from the cross
According to the book of Acts, this preaching is a testimony that Jesus Christ, the One who was crucified, has been resurrected
In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, 'But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God's power and God's wisdom'
Wisdom is for planning, for purposing; power is for carrying out, for accomplishing, what is planned and purposed
In verse 25 Paul concludes, 'Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men'
As believers in Christ, we all must be able to answer this question: Why was it necessary for Christ to be crucified?
In his preaching to the philosophical Greeks at Corinth, Paul must have indicated why it was necessary for Christ to be crucified
Perhaps the most common answer to this question is to say that Christ had to be crucified in order for God to save us
In addition to all these problems, there is the problem of the ordinances and regulations given by God for man's living
The cross deals with the problems of Satan, the world, sin, man, the flesh, the natural life, oldness, and ordinances
In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says, 'I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep'
If Christ had not been willing to lay down His life, it would not have been possible for people to execute Him
It takes the power of God to defeat Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances
When we call on the name of the Lord, enjoy Christ, and are filled with the life-giving Spirit, we have no problem with our temper
We have seen that when we experience the crucified Christ, He becomes to us both the power of God and the wisdom of God
Since we have the crucified Christ as God's wisdom, there is no need for us to seek a way to carry out God's will
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, as we are enjoying Him and experiencing Him, His crucifixion will terminate us
To us who have been called, the crucified Christ is God's power and God's wisdom for us to be delivered from all negative things
In verse 26 Paul says For you see your calling brothers that there are not many wise according to flesh not many powerful not many wellborn
God's choosing was ordained before the foundation of the world ; His calling is accomplished in time to carry out His choosing
The expression 'things which are not' refers to the lowborn and the despised as being as good as having no existence
things that are' refer to the wellborn, who are counted much in the world but brought to nothing by God in His economy
God uses these very things to bring to nothing the things which are, the wellborn who are counted much in the world
There is no indication in your living that God has chosen you, for you think of yourselves as wise, strong, and wellborn
Remember, He has chosen the foolish ones to shame the wise, the weak ones to shame the strong, and the lowborn to shame the wellborn
God has transferred us out of Adam into Christ through Christ's crucifixion and resurrection and by our believing and being baptized
According to our experience, too many times we are wise in the flesh, but foolish in Christ; strong in the flesh, but weak in Christ
Regeneration causes us to be wellborn, and it gives us a very high status, the status of a child in a royal family
Do you realize that, as one who believes in Christ, you have a divine status, that you are a child of the King of kings?
Sisters, if in your experience you are strong in Christ, you will have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem and not be so quick to shed tears
In 1:30 Paul says that Christ Jesus 'became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
Notice that in verse 30 Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; he says that Christ became wisdom to us
The expression 'to us from God' indicates something present, practical, and experiential in the way of transmission
The words 'to' and 'from' indicate that a present, living, and practical transmission is taking place from God to us
In verse 30 Paul definitely says Christ 'became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
It is certainly correct to say that Christ is righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future
Every day we need to be righteous, we need to be sanctified, and we need to be redeemed, not only in one matter, but in all matters
With regard to everything in our daily life, we need to be terminated, replaced with Christ, and brought back to God
The way we deal with our children, if it is still the old way, needs to be terminated, replaced with Christ, and brought back to God
When Christ becomes wisdom to us from God, eventually in everything He will be our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
In our experience, the matter of being one spirit with the Lord follows being called by God into the fellowship of His Son
In 10:16 Paul speaks of this: 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
As a help to understanding these matters, we need to consider the way Paul deals with the problems among the believers at Corinth
To be sure, a government official, a thief, a professor, and an uneducated person will each deal with the same problem in a different way
In keeping with this principle, the way Paul deals with the problems among the Corinthians is based on the kind of person he is
To understand how Paul deals with the problems we must first know what kind of person he was and what was within him
For this reason, a person is often the most genuine when he loses his temper, because at such a time his spirit comes forth
When we behave ourselves carefully and act in a certain way, we may cover up our real being and not express our real person
Paul certainly knew that God the Father is the source, that God the Son is the course, and that God the Spirit is the flow
If we understand this, we shall be able to understand why Paul dealt with the church in Corinth the way he did
In dealing with the problems in the church at Corinth, Paul includes the verses we quoted at the beginning of this message
He goes on to say that through this faithful God we have been called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ
What help could this render to the divisive Corinthians to those who were saying that they were of Paul Apollos Cephas or of a narrow Christ
In 10:1-13 Paul takes the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament as a type of the New Testament believers
Here Paul specifically uses the experience of the children of Israel in the wilderness as a type to warn the Corinthians
Paul tells them that God's people passed through the sea and 'all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea'
In verse 5 Paul speaks a serious word saying But with most of them God was not well pleased for they were strewn along in the wilderness
If we read this portion of 1 Corinthians in a thoughtful way, we may wonder what was Paul's main purpose in giving this warning
Rather, with most of the children of Israel God was not well pleased; they died and were strewn in the wilderness
You believers at Corinth also have a goal promised by God, and this goal is to enter into Christ as the good land
After issuing the warning based on the type of the children of Israel, Paul goes on to speak about the Lord's table
Through the faithful God we, the called saints, have been called into the fellowship, the participation, the enjoyment, of His Son
Of course, the word fellowship is used twice in 10:16 with reference to the fellowship of the body and blood of the Lord
In 1:9 the fellowship is that in the Son of God, but in 10:16 this fellowship becomes the fellowship of the Lord's body and blood
The process Christ has gone through can be illustrated by the process of preparing a chicken to become our food
The Son of God, Jesus Christ, has also been slain, prepared, processed, 'cooked,' to be the body and blood on the table, ready for us to eat
The four matters covered by Paul in these verses are tools used to deal with the problems among the Corinthians
If we consider these matters and understand them, we shall have a deep and more comprehensive view of the Lord's table
If we have this view when we come to the table, it will make a difference as far as the enjoyment of Christ is concerned
In 1 Corinthians chapters one, two, and three Paul uses a number of special terms and extraordinary expressions
In 1:9 Paul says, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
He does not say that we have been called to heaven or to eternal blessings he says that we have been called into the fellowship of Gods Son
Throughout the centuries, Christians have not adequately touched the depth and the profoundness of these matters
Few Christians realize that God has a pleasure and that His plan is to dispense Himself into us and work Himself into us
In Ephesians 1:5 Paul speaks of 'the good pleasure of His will,' and in verse 9, of 'His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself'
Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Long after God accomplished the work of creation the first step toward the dispensing of Himself into us God took the second stepincarnation
Whenever a person prays in such a way, this dear, excellent, wonderful One, the very One who is the Spirit and resurrection, enters into him
Every genuine Christian can testify that when he believed in the Lord and called on His name, something unusual happened to him
Once we have received the Lord into us, He will never leave, even if we sometimes regret that we have become a Christian
The One whom we have received is Christ, the Redeemer, the Savior, the life-giving Spirit, and the resurrection
The One in whom we believe, whom we have received, and who has entered into us should also be the One upon whom we call
As we have seen, Paul speaks of this in 1:2, when he refers to 'all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place'
Instead of praying quietly, he calls aloud on the name of the Lord, declaring that he believes in Him and receives Him
When you come to a feast attended by a large number of people and enjoy the feast with them, you have communion
It is the fellowship of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ, the One who in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit
Christ is the life, the resurrection, the sanctification, the justification, the redemption, and everything to us
Because of their philosophizing some of them said I am of Paul others said I am of Apollos and still others declared I am of Cephas
Of taking Christ the allinclusive One as their portion the Corinthians were taking another person Paul Apollos or Cephas as their portion
In this Epistle Paul seems to be saying, 'Believers at Corinth, you have not been called into your own preferences
Again and again we have pointed out that in verse 9 Paul says that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son
We see that Paul beseeches the believers through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the very name upon which all believers call
Because the Corinthians were saying, 'I am of Paul,' or, 'I am of Apollos,' they were speaking different things
If we go on to consider verses 11 through 13, we shall see that the fellowship in verse 9 is in contrast to the divisions in verse 10
Now that Christ has terminated us on the cross, what He has terminated He is replacing with Himself in resurrection
Resurrection is the life-giving Spirit, the life-giving Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the processed Triune God
These five problems involve headship, the Lord's table, spiritual gifts, resurrection, and the gift of material things
Paul's way of dealing with these problems is very different from the way practiced by today's ministers and pastors
The first chapter of this Epistle begins with one part of the chain, and the last chapter ends with another part
The problems among the believers at Corinth were all due to the fact that they were neglecting Christ as their unique portion
We are called saints, those who have been called by God to call upon the dear and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
If a married sister calls on the name of the all-inclusive Christ, she will be truly submissive to her husband
We cannot receive the nourishment we need simply from the Bible in black and white letters, for what we need is the living Christ Himself
If we call on the name of the Lord Jesus in every place, we shall know that Christ is ours, and we shall enjoy Him
Corinthians 1:9 says, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
We have seen that the all-inclusive Christ is our portion and that we have been called into the fellowship of this Christ
It is vital for all believers to realize that our spirit has been regenerated and is indwelt by the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
The brother facing difficulty with his wife should exercise his spirit and allow the life-giving Spirit to guide him
Because we have a regenerated spirit, we can experience Christ as our portion and also experience the fellowship of this Christ
Apart from Christ, it is not possible for any brother to be an adequate husband or for any sister to be a proper wife
Since marriage is Gods ordination and since it is so difficult to be a proper husband or wife we have no choice except to experience Christ
As many of us can testify, when we exercise our spirit and call on the name of the Lord, we enjoy His sweetness
At other times praises may burst forth, and we may thank the Lord for giving us the best and most suitable wife or husband
If we call on the name of the Lord by exercising our spirit, we shall immediately realize that God has given us the best mate
In 10:16 Paul comes to another important point: 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
Corinthians 1:9 speaks of the fellowship of the Son, but 10:16 speaks of the fellowship of the body and blood of Christ
As we shall see in a later message, the table with the body and blood of Christ is the reality of Christ as the good land
In 1 Corinthians Paul does not deal with the problems among the believers in a religious way or in a natural, human way
In this Epistle it seems as if Paul is telling the Corinthians, 'You need to realize that Christ alone is your portion
Christ, the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected One, is now presented to you on the table as a feast for your nourishment and enjoyment
If we have problems in the church life or in our family life, it is because we lack the adequate enjoyment of Christ
What we need is not a doctrinal Christ in our mentality, but a Christ in our spirit whom we can enjoy and experience in a practical way
We have seen that to be called into the fellowship of Christ means to be called into the co-enjoyment of Christ as our unique portion
When you are served a platter of chicken, the host may ask you what part of the chicken you prefer, the wings, the breast, or the leg
In verses 24 and 30 we have different aspects of Christ; we have the 'wings,' 'breast,' and 'legs' of Christ for our enjoyment
In verse 2 Paul speaks of our portion, and in verse 9 he tells us that we have been called into the enjoyment of this portion
Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the materials used in the construction of the freeway in our Christian life
When we enjoy Christ, the first aspect of the divine virtue, the divine goodness, we shall experience is God as our righteousness
Later, when this elder exercises his spirit and calls on the name of the Lord, he realizes that he was unrighteous
As we gradually become righteous in this way, we shall eventually become righteous in the way we speak to our husband or wife
We have pointed out that the more we exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord, the more righteous we become
When a sister calls on the name of the Lord and becomes righteous, she experiences Christ as sanctification, and she is sanctified
In a number of cases a sister's sanctification convinced her husband and influenced him to believe in the Lord
The more we call on the Lord's name, the more we shall gradually come to realize how much we are still in the old creation
Redemption includes the realization of our need to be terminated and our realization that the Lord is in fact terminating us
When we experience Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, we truly have Him as wisdom to us from God
Verse 9 says that we have been called into the enjoyment, into the fellowship, of Christ as our unique portion
In the last few verses of chapter one we see that when we enjoy Christ as this portion, we become righteous, sanctified, and redeemed
If we read 1 Corinthians only in a superficial way, we may think that it is a book which deals merely with outward matters
In 1:9 Paul says, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
Verse 1 of this psalm declares, 'Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity'!
The apostles had preached the gospel to them, and this gospel preaching brought them into something which the Bible calls fellowship
In the New Testament fellowship describes both the flowing between us and the Lord and between us and one another
There is a flow, a current, vertically between us and the Father and the Son and horizontally between us and other believers
Just as there is the circulation of blood in the human body so there is a spiritual circulation called the fellowship in the Body of Christ
It is a very sad thing that among a great many of today's Christians, this circulation is either neglected or is altogether lacking
It is crucial for us to realize that in the Lord's recovery we are being brought back into this flow, into this fellowship
From 1:9 we see that through the faithful God we have been called into the fellowship of the Son of God, Jesus Christ
The fellowship in 1:9 is our participation in Christ; it is our enjoyment and appreciation of Him and our preference for Him
In these verses Paul seems to be saying to the believers at Corinth, 'Don't say that you are of this person or of that person
Redemption also is not merely a thing, but a matter that involves a process, for it involves the action of being redeemed
It is significant that in verse 30 Paul speaks of righteousness, but not of justification, and of sanctification, but not of holiness
Why does Paul speak of righteousness but not holiness, and why does he speak of sanctification and redemption, but not of justification?
If the wife enjoys Christ, He will become righteousness to her, and she will have the same realization about herself
Christ will be not only our transfiguration in the future but is also our present transfiguration, redemption, in our being
God had called them into the fellowship of His Son, into the fellowship of the One who is God's wisdom and power
It is better that our speaking be considered awkward than that we should cause others to miss the basic matters of Christ and the cross
Recently, in the Life-study of Exodus we saw that the ark of the testimony, a type of Christ, has measurements which are half units
When Paul came to Corinth, he announced both halves of God's testimony; that is, he preached concerning Christ and the church
The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle's ministry
According to verse 2, Paul determined not to know anything among the Corinthians except Christ and Him crucified
Paul's meaning in verse 2 is that he determined not to know philosophy, culture, doctrine, religion, or any kind of practice
It is not correct to say that Paul excluded the church when he declared that he determined not to know anything other than Christ
In verse 2 Paul seems to be saying Dear brothers in Corinth you are still very philosophical and you live a life according to your wisdom
If all the saints in the local churches determine to know nothing except Christ Jesus, there will be no problems in the church life
Whenever they are asked a question they reply that they only know Christ calling on the name of the Lord praying and enjoying the Lord Jesus
Sometimes when we visit a church in another locality, the saints there have questions about certain doctrines and practices
It is not surprising that Paul's intention was to belittle their knowledge and point them to the crucified Christ
Weakness here refers to the apostle's physical weakness due perhaps to his physical sufferings in the persecutions he endured for the gospel
The religious Jews were proud of their traditional religion, and the philosophical Greeks were haughty in their worldly wisdom
When we speak to others about Christ, it is best to forget what kind of people they are and simply proclaim the testimony concerning Christ
Verse 4 says, 'And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power'
In centuries past both the Nestorians and the Jesuits attempted to convert the learned Chinese to Christianity
Some Chinese did embrace the Christian religion because of their efforts; however, they did so without actually receiving Christ
By this we see that it is a mistake to come down to someone's level when we preach Christ to him and try to use his language and philosophy
If we have the vision of God's economy, we shall automatically have only one choice, preference, taste, and ministry
Today we in the Lord's recovery must be strong and unshakable in the vision of God's economy, God's eternal will
The comma in the title indicates that Christ as the deep things of God stands in apposition to God's wisdom in a mystery
In the foregoing verses Paul says that he did not come with excellence of wisdom and that his speech was not in persuasive words of wisdom
Paul seems to be saying, 'You Corinthians think you have attained something great, but actually you are still babes
Gods wisdom is Christ who is the hidden mystery predestined predesignated and foreordained before the ages in eternity for our glory
God in His wisdom has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification
Verse 10 says, 'For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
The more we consider 2:6-10, the more we realize that these verses are deep, profound, and difficult to understand
If we have this understanding of the central thought of chapters one and two, we are prepared to consider 2:6-10
God's wisdom in a mystery has not only been hidden, but also predestined by God to become our destiny for our glory
Even those at Corinth who had believed in the Lord and received Him were still veiled by their philosophy and wisdom
Your destiny is the mysterious and hidden Christ, the One who is the wisdom of God, the center of God's economy and our portion
Paul says that there is a wisdom, a mysterious, hidden wisdom, a wisdom hidden in God, which is Christ Himself
If we see this, we shall want to bow down before the Lord, worship Him, and offer our thanks and praise to Him
To fear God to worship God and to believe in God that is to receive God are all inadequate to love Him is the indispensable requirement
In verse 10 Paul says, 'For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
The Greek word rendered searches includes active research and implies accurate knowledge not in discovering but in exploring
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
Some think that to have biblical knowledge about the seven heads, the ten horns, and the seventy weeks is to know deep things
What is deeper than the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit and our being joined to the Lord as one spirit?
If we would know the depths of God, we must know that through incarnation God one day became a man named Jesus
Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us
Christ is the center of God's economy, the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment, and the mysterious wisdom hidden in God
Christ's crucifixion involved not only the death of the Lord Jesus, but the termination of everything of the old creation
By believing in the crucified and resurrected Christ, they have received the divine life and the divine Spirit
The believers at Corinth, most of whom were Greeks, received the initial gifts, the divine life and the divine Spirit
In writing to the Corinthians Paul seemed to be saying You believers there in Corinth should drop your Greek culture wisdom and philosophy
Now that God has made you Christians, you should take Christ as your life, content, and everything, and you should live Christ
It is far beyond philosophical people to comprehend this wisdom, for it is a wisdom hidden in God and is even the depths of God
If we understand this underlying concept, it will be much easier for us to understand the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians
We all must forsake our culture, philosophy, ethics, and traditions and center on Christ as our unique portion
Now that we are in the church life in the Lord's recovery, we should not be shaped by something other than Christ
When Paul came to Corinth and preached Christ, he determined not to know anything among them except Jesus Christ and this One crucified
Its faculty can penetrate the innermost region of the things of man, whereas the mind of man is capable only of knowing superficial things
Gymnastics were for the training and development of the body, and philosophy was for the development of the mind
The believers at Corinth knew how to exercise the body and the mind, but they were ignorant concerning the human spirit
In order to know these things, the Corinthians had to pay attention to their human spirit and to the Spirit of God
The Greek word rendered communicating literally means mixing or putting together, as interpreting or expounding
The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done, but rather on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken
Paul says that he did not speak the spiritual things in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit
Because the word table is a designation of an actual table, we should not regard the word as one thing and the table as another
Spiritual things are both the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion and also the words taught by the Spirit of God
The believers at Corinth talked about Christ not in spiritual words, but in the words of Greek philosophy and wisdom
In verse 13 Paul seems to be saying to the Corinthians, 'I cannot use words of Greek wisdom to communicate spiritual things
We simply cannot communicate spiritual things by means of Greek philosophy Chinese ethics or with the expressions common to American culture
Those who translated the Bible into Chinese learned the importance of using spiritual words to communicate spiritual things
Verses 14 and 15 stress the spiritual object, that is, a spiritual man, not a soulish one, who is able to discern the spiritual things
A soulish man cannot know these things, for he does not have the constitutional capacity for spiritual perception
Spiritual things are spiritually discerned, examined, and investigated by spiritual persons with spiritual means
Today many Christians can be compared to cows listening to music: they have no appreciation or discernment of what they hear
Paul did not come to Corinth to display excellent speech or philosophical wisdom in proclaiming the testimony of God
In verse 10 Paul says, 'For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
When we receive such a vision concerning Christ, we begin to know the mystery of the universe and of human life
We realize that we are in the very heart, the depths, of the almighty God and that He becomes our inner element
Those who oppose the truth that we who believe in Christ are mingled with God will call this heresy because they have not experienced it
Because our experience is limited, we are not able to explain adequately what it means for Christ to be the depths of God
As those who were created by God and who became fallen, we need to repent, we need to be saved, and we need to be regenerated
Now as saved and regenerated ones, we must love the Lord, live Him, express Him, and fulfill His eternal purpose
As soon as a person's spirit is stirred up in this way, he begins to know the real meaning of human life and also the source of human life
Probably the only place where Christians today hear messages on the development of the regenerated human spirit is in the Lord's recovery
In these verses we have spiritual knowledge, spiritual communication, spiritual discernment, and spiritual persons
To be spiritual is to have your spirit, the regenerated human spirit, mingled with the Spirit of God to become one spirit
Whenever you are in the mingled spirit you are spiritual and you have spiritual discernment spiritual knowledge and spiritual communication
According to the context of these chapters, to be soulish is to be Greek and to live according to Greek culture
Because they live in the mingled spirit, they are truly spiritual and they have spiritual knowledge, discernment, and communication
In the mingled spirit we enjoy Christ not in a superficial way, but as the depths of God and even in the depths of God
We enjoy Him in a way that eye has not seen, ear has not heard, mind has not thought, and heart has never imagined
God has predestined Christ for us He has prepared Him for us He has revealed Him to us and He has given Him to us as the deep things of God
We shall be able to discern the things of man and of God and to communicate with others spiritually in the mingled spirit
We shall experience Him in a way that even surpasses these aspects, for we shall experience God Himself with all His depths
It certainly is interesting that such a doctrinal book as Romans begins with sinners and concludes with local churches
By considering these three chapters we see what serious complications there were among the believers at Corinth
The book of Romans reveals that we are in Christ, but in 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul declares further: 'But of Him you are in Christ Jesus'
We may even say that God had a dream concerning us, a dream that, according to the desire of His heart, we would be in Christ
In Romans there are many precious things, but the precious things in 1 Corinthians are especially good to our taste
Knowing about a person in this way has nothing to do with what Paul means by the things of man in 1 Corinthians
According to John 6:42, the Jews said, 'Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know'?
At a certain point, he may say, 'If you don't have adequate knowledge, you will not be able to understand these things'
Even though it is common for us to speak different things, the desire of God is that all His saved and redeemed people speak the same thing
In 1:10 Paul goes on to say, 'That there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion'
According to Paul's word in 1:10, we should not only speak the same thing, but also be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion
Finally, in verse 25 Paul declares, 'Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men'
Verse 30 says, 'But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
As we consider the book of 1 Corinthians we see that the things of man include mans position situation condition need source and destiny
Although they endeavored to follow the Old Testament to a certain extent, they did not have the true knowledge of God
Because He exercised His spirit with the Spirit of God, He could know both the things of man and the things of God
In 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 we see that Paul is an example of a person who knows the things of man and also the things of God
As he depicts the condition and situation among those philosophical Greeks at Corinth, he gives us a portrait of God
Is it not amazing that as he describes the condition of the believers he presents a picture of the things of God?
In the same principle, in chapter three the Corinthian believers were destroying the church; however, God was building it up
By showing how much the Corinthians needed Christ, Paul also reveals to what extent God was supplying them with Christ
If we would know the things of man and the things of God, we need the two spirits, the human spirit and the divine Spirit
Because the Corinthian believers neglected these two spirits, they could know neither the things of man nor the things of God
If you exercise your spirit and rely on the Spirit of God, you will know your condition, situation, position, need, and destiny
Something Paul says in 4:21 makes it very clear that Paul was in spirit as he wrote to the believers at Corinth
Of exercising your spirit, you are exalting your philosophy and wisdom and are making choices according to your preferences
Paul also realized that the Corinthian believers trusted more in their philosophical wisdom than in the Spirit of God
The majority of believers hold to a doctrine of dichotomy-the belief that man is composed of two main parts, the soul and the body
On another occasion, the same person may utter the same sounds, but they are given an altogether different interpretation
Some claimed to be healed, but eventually this supposed healing was proved to be merely a psychological phenomenon
The claim has been made in some Pentecostal groups that in their meetings people's teeth have been filled with gold miraculously
In his ministry Paul tells us that we are in Christ, that Christ is in us, and that we are joined to Christ as one spirit
Certain believers treasure the truth of baptism by immersion and even take it as the basis to form the Baptist denomination
Other doctrinal matters have been recovered which also are not elements of the central vision of Paul's ministry
Regarding the sisters' head covering, some have inquired, 'Why do so many of the sisters in your meetings not wear a head covering?
We realize that today what the Lord is seeking to recover is not head covering or any other doctrine or practice as a central thing
We agree that immersion and head covering are aspects of the recovery, but neither of these things is the center
The center of the Lord's recovery is Christ and the church: Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ
By ascension, He was glorified, exalted, enthroned, appointed Lord, and commissioned with the divine government
We in the Lord's recovery, therefore, should not care for insignificant things or be distracted by doctrines or practices
In the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians Paul paves the way for us to see the central vision of His completing ministry
We shall not care for our attainments, but only for our position in Christ and our condition, situation, and destiny in Him
We shall also care for the genuine experience of the Triune God and for the enjoyment of Christ, the Son of God
From these examples we see that it matters very much that we use the proper organs in dealing with various matters
Some denominations even conduct seminars in which people are trained to use their mentality to solve problems among Christians
Instead of using the spirit, the majority of Christians use their natural mind to understand, analyze, visualize, and philosophize
In John 14:17 the Lord Jesus says concerning the Spirit of reality, 'You know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you'
If it did refer to Christ's second coming, then all the Christians from the first century until now would have been orphans
The words 'a little while' certainly do not refer to the nineteen hundred years that have gone by since the Lord's first coming
The Lord says that the Father and the Son will come to the one who loves the Lord and make Their abode with him
Concerning Christ, one side of the truth is that Christ has ascended to the heavens and has sent down the Holy Spirit
It is indeed sad that many Christians today emphasize just one aspect of the truth and altogether neglect the other aspect
We need to turn from the traditional teachings, come back to the pure Word, and accept both aspects of the divine truth
Should he turn to the spirit, he would immediately have a sense of God and realize that he must pray and ask for forgiveness
Because Paul exercised his spirit, he had a thorough knowledge of the situation and condition of the believers at Corinth
In chapter two he seems to be telling them, 'Because you Corinthians are still in your Greek philosophical mind, you don't know yourselves
Because you exercise your mind and not your spirit, you do not know the things of man concerning the experience of Christ and the church
There may be many things which they have not yet confessed to God and concerning which they have not received His cleansing
They may be proud in their thoughts, thinking that they are right and that everyone else, including the whole church, is wrong
God's Spirit enables us to know not only where we are wrong, but also that God loves us and that Christ wants to be our life and our person
We shall also know where we are missing the mark of the divine provisions God has predestined, prepared, revealed, and given to us
Paul did not use superficial expressions with regard to the church; here he speaks of the church by using deep and profound expressions
The building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness
In verses 16 and 17 Paul twice refers to the temple of God Do you not know that you are a temple of God and the Spirit of God dwells in you
God's building is not an ordinary building; it is the sanctuary of the holy God, the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells
Apparently, a farm is not related to a building, for a farm produces food for eating, not materials for building
We all should practice the church life in the way of farming, in the way of planting, watering, cultivating, and trimming
Paul's intention in 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 is to present Christ as our portion, enjoyment, life, living, content, and everything
The church is not built with the objective Christ, with a Christ who is in the heavens or who suddenly descends from the heavens
In the Life-study of Exodus we pointed out that the materials used for the building of the tabernacle were called heave offerings
Only materials gained, possessed, and offered in this way could be the proper materials for the building of the tabernacle
We need to bring what we have experienced of Christ to the church meetings and offer this Christ to the Lord as a heave offering
Building the church is not merely a matter of preaching the gospel saving sinners and bringing these newly saved ones into a socalled church
There is no building because there is no experience of Christ, no growing of Christ as the material for God's building
If you water another saint spontaneously, even unintentionally, the Lord will sovereignly send others to you that you may water them
Even though we have left our religious background behind the influence of this background still follows us and keeps us from watering others
Even though you may feel dead, the fact that you are still in the church life proves that you are not completely dead
Because of our religious background, it is easy for us to apply Paul's word only to such persons as Paul and Apollos
We may think that only certain ones can plant and water, but that we ourselves are not able to carry out this work
You may do certain things wrong, but eventually you will learn from your mistakes and become skillful at planting and watering
Because Paul says that he planted and Apollos watered, do not think that Paul is useful only for planting and Apollos only for watering
To plant is to minister life and impart life to someone who is spiritually dead so that this person may become living
The second aspect of planting is to bring the living plants into contact with the proper soil and to place them in the soil
On the one hand, we need to learn how to impart Christ into sinners through the preaching of the gospel in life
The Corinthian believers, under the influence of Greek philosophical wisdom, paid too much attention to knowledge and neglected life
In verse 7 Paul says, 'So that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God'
As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether a planter or a waterer, are nothing, and God is everything
The more we try to solve problems, the more problems there will be, and the more others will be killed by our efforts
Of becoming involved with problems, we should be simple in our contact with those who come to us for fellowship
The elders in some churches are not planting and watering; instead, in their efforts to help the saints to grow, they are plucking them up
God's eternal goal is the building, the temple built with precious materials on Christ as the unique foundation
The foundation of the building is unique, but the building may differ due to different builders with different materials
The intention of the apostle in this Epistle is to warn the believers not to build the church with the things of their natural background
The philosophical Greek believers at Corinth did not have the proper realization that God's eternal goal is to have a temple
The believers at Corinth cared for various personal and individual matters, but neglected God's building as His eternal goal
He definitely does not want the saints to have personal, individualistic preferences for Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or even for a limited Christ
God cares for the building, and He desires that all the believers in a locality be built together as His temple
If we would be built up together to become God's dwelling place, we need to grow, and in order to grow, we need the watering
He also realized clearly that the Greek believers at Corinth were too individualistic in their concept and practice
His goal is to have a farm that will grow materials for the building up of the holy temple as His dwelling place
We need to consider the background of this Epistle to understand Paul's use of the expressions God's farm and God's building
The Greek believers at Corinth did not care for the corporate church life, but cared instead for their personal and individual interests
God's holy temple is separate from anything human, secular, and worldly; in particular, it is separated from anything Greek
If we do not have a proper corporate church life, we cannot have much enjoyment of the indwelling of the Spirit
The Spirit's indwelling in the church corporately is much richer and is more prevailing than His indwelling in the believers individually
When they were declaring that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, they were saying that these were their foundation and standing
We should realize not only that we are builders, but also that we must take heed how we build upon Christ as the unique foundation
As we shall see the church the house of God must be built with gold silver and precious stones materials produced from Christs growing in us
Each of us, every member of the Body, must take heed how we build; that is, we must take heed with what material we build
Paul's underlying thought in chapters one and two is that Christ is God's unique center and also the portion of the saints
Paul writes of the church not in the way of doctrine, not even the doctrine of life, but in the way of the experience of life
In 3:1 Paul says, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ'
Paul is very frank in telling the Corinthians that he could not speak unto them as to spiritual, but as to fleshy
The term fleshy is a stronger expression than fleshly in verse 3, and it refers to aspects of the flesh that are more gross
Fleshy denotes made of flesh; fleshly denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh, partaking of the character of the flesh
In verse 1 the apostle considers the Corinthian believers to be totally of the flesh, made of the flesh, and just the flesh
The apostle here points out their deficiency and indicates their need, that is, to grow in life to maturity, to be full grown
In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, 'I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not then able to receive it
The fact that the Corinthian believers could not receive solid food indicates that they were not growing in life
In saying that they were of Paul or of Apollos, the Corinthians were walking according to the fallen natural man
Many Christians today do not realize that they have received the initial gifts in life and that they urgently need the growth in life
Although they had received the seed, they still needed the growth in life for the development of the gifts they had received
Even though the miraculous gifts have their source in God, they actually do not count as much as the initial gifts
After one of the meetings, the leader of this group and his wife tried to get a particular Chinese brother to speak in tongues
Immediately the leader of this Pentecostal group and his wife clapped their hands and rejoiced that this brother had spoken in tongues
We all need to see that these gifts are the seed sown into us and that these gifts need to be developed and cultivated
In this Epistle Paul is seeking to develop and cultivate the initial gifts received by the Corinthian believers
In 1 Corinthians 3 the burden in Paul's spirit was to help the believers at Corinth realize what they had and what they needed
They had the divine life and the Holy Spirit, and they needed growth-growth in life and growth in the Holy Spirit
If you can help a weaker one or a young one have some contact with God, that will bring in the genuine watering
Many of those in the charismatic movement or the Pentecostal movement do not care for life or for the growth in life
Of concentrating on the development of the divine life within the believers, they give their attention to the pursuit of miraculous gifts
What we need in the Lord's recovery, and what the Lord is seeking among us, is more growth in life, more development of the initial gifts
In watering others we should not try to solve their problems or presume to do God's work by trying to help others grow
What a privilege and glory that men can be God's fellow-workers, working together with God on His farm to grow Christ!
If the saints in a particular locality are short of the growth of life, they cannot have the proper church life
Because they did not have the normal growth in life, they did not have the proper Christian life, church life, and Body life
When Balaam's donkey spoke a human language, that certainly was a miraculous occurrence, a true instance of speaking in tongues
The tongues-speaking in chapters twelve and fourteen refers to the speaking of an actual language which a person has not learned
If these sounds were recorded and analyzed by a linguist, it would be proved that they are not part of any language or dialect
Among Pentecostal and charismatic groups, there are many supposed instances of speaking in tongues with interpretation
In another meeting the same person may utter the same sounds; however, they are given a different interpretation
We know from Paul's word in 3:1 that the Corinthian believers had not grown in life, but remained in the stage of infancy
In writing this Epistle Paul was burdened to tell them that they should no longer live their Greek culture, wisdom, and philosophy
Paul, however, seemed to be saying, 'Brothers, God has called you into the fellowship of His Son, not into your culture
The very Christ who is your portion and into whose fellowship you have been called has become wisdom from God to you
In many cases the saints, by their reaction to what is ministered, show that they are not able to come up to this level
Instead of caring for the 'diamonds' found in the messages, many paid more attention to the 'wrappings' and the 'box'
Throughout the generations most readers of this Epistle have touched only the wrappings or the box, not the diamonds, the deep things of God
We need to testify of this fellowship, this mutual enjoyment, not in a doctrinal way, but in the way of experience
To learn doctrine is to receive only milk, whereas to take the diamonds in an experiential way is to receive solid food
Those who are infants are full of jealousy and strife and walk according to man, that is, according to fallen man in the flesh
Those who are infants, who are shallow and superficial concerning spiritual things, still have jealousy and strife
It is possible for us to be like the Corinthians in exalting certain spiritual giants and thereby causing division
When we hear a message, we should be able to get into the depths of that message and not be distracted by the wrappings or the box
Praise the Lord that the farm is for the growth in life and that the building is for the fulfillment of God's goal!
According to the context, to be holy here is not simply to be separated to God; to be holy means not to be Greek
In the same principle, for us to be holy, separated unto God, means that we are no longer American, Chinese, Japanese, or German
When we realize our shortage concerning the growth in life and the building we may react in a way which causes us to become even more veiled
Romans 9:16 says, 'So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One Who shows mercy'
We do not need to weep, pray, or repent in a religious way, but we do need the Lord's mercy to see the vision shown to Paul
We need to see that we are living in many things other than Christ and that we are not actually living Christ day by day
Although we should not pray in an excited way or in a religious way, we should pray earnestly for the Lord's mercy
Doctrinally speaking, many Christians understand what it means not to lay any foundation other than Jesus Christ
He realized that by saying that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, the Corinthians were actually laying another foundation
In the church in our locality we should not say that we are of anything or anyone or that we are for anything or anyone
The best way to respond is not to correct the brother or argue with him, but to pray-read a few verses with him
After you have pray-read with this one, there is no need to argue with him about the church or to try to improve him
To fellowship with others with a living spirit full of the riches of Christ is to build upon Christ as the unique foundation
Whatever Paul says in this book is presented in a practical way in order to solve the problems among the believers
His word concerning Christ as the unique foundation should be understood not doctrinally, but in a way that is practical and experiential
In everything we do in the church life, we must take heed not to minister anything other than the Christ we have experienced
In chapter three Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, 'Brothers, be careful how you build on Christ as the foundation
It is crucial for us all to learn to build upon Christ as the foundation with the Christ we have experienced in a practical way
In verse 12 Paul says, 'But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble'
Gold, silver, and precious stones signify various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God
All these precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit
The proper materials for the building up of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones, all of which are minerals
We need not only to grow in life, but also to be transformed in life, as revealed in 2 Corinthians 3:18 and Romans 12:2
In the New Testament transformation involves metabolism, a process in which a new element is added into our being to replace the old element
Just as a child must have food in order to grow, we as plants on God's farm must also have something with which to grow
Eventually, this brother will be helped to see that there is not anything of the nature of God in his good virtues
He will realize that his love, kindness, and humility do not contain the divine gold, but are simply the wood of his natural humanity
If we seek the Lord, we shall eventually come to realize that, no matter what we may be like in our natural being, we are fallen
Redemption, therefore, involves termination, being brought back to God, and being replaced with what Christ is
If we have the adequate experience of Christ's redemption, in our contact with the saints we shall impart the reality of redemption to them
Every local church is troubled by death, which comes from gossip, negative talk, and even from the natural virtues
Whenever you minister gold and silver to the saints the negative germs within them are killed and the saints are nourished in a positive way
If we minister gold and silver to the saints, the issue will be precious stones, the Spirit's transforming work
If we build the church with these precious materials and not with our natural man or culture we shall be taking heed how we build on Christ
In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, 'If anyone's work which he has built upon it shall remain, he shall receive a reward'
The work that remains must be that of gold, silver, and precious stones, the product of faithful ministers of Christ
In many cases they are not even interested in it and prefer other portions of the Bible, such as Proverbs, which suit their natural concept
In reading the Bible many of us have the habit of trying to understand it merely in a doctrinal way or in a theological way
We should also inquire what is the significance of gold silver and precious stones and what is the meaning of the wood grass and stubble
All these worthless materials are the product of the believers' natural man together with what they have collected from their background
Whenever we build according to what we are in our natural being or according to our natural preference, we build with grass
Everywhere we can see the natural makeup the natural being and even such things as jealousy envy strife hatred murmuring and complaining
In chapter three Paul charges the saints not to lay anything or anyone other than Christ as the unique foundation
The Corinthians were not to build with their Greek nature, their Greek self, or their Greek jealousy, strife, and criticism
They even wanted the chapels and church buildings to be constructed in a native way instead of in a Western way
The Christians in this movement appreciated the Bible, but they rejected the culture brought over by the missionaries
To have a native denomination or group is to build with our natural makeup and being, no matter what these may be
As soon as the meeting is over, they put on their caps, not caring whether they are inside or outside the meeting hall
If we look at the situation among Christians today, we shall realize that Paul's word about wood, grass, and stubble is not a mere doctrine
Those believers whose Christian works will not be approved by the judging Lord and who will suffer the loss of reward will still be saved
If we would have the proper and deep understanding of these verses, we need to know the background against which they were written
What was the situation among the Corinthians that caused Paul to say that, apart from Christ, there is no other foundation?
The background was that the philosophical believers in Corinth were turning to their Greek culture, philosophy, and wisdom instead of Christ
As we consider the situation among Christians today, we see that there is almost every kind of foundation imaginable
Do not build with Greek culture, with your opinions or philosophy or with your appreciation or preference for any persons
To understand 3:11 in this way is to go beyond mere doctrine and grasp the practical significance of Paul's word
Knowing their situation, Paul seemed to be telling them, 'Don't lay Greek culture or philosophy as a foundation
To experience the transforming work of the Spirit is to undergo a metabolic change by the divine life within us
Paul was burdened to show them that this is not the way to have the Christian life, the church life, or the Body life
In 2:10 Paul says, 'For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
These depths can be realized and discerned not by our philosophical mind, but only by our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
By means of the mingled spirit alone can we discern the depths of God, the different aspects of Christ as our portion for our enjoyment
It is not to exercise your mind so much, but to remain continually in your spirit, where the Spirit of God dwells
Christ will then become your nourishment, and you will grow with Him and become precious materials for God's building
For the proper building we need to enjoy, experience, and possess the nature of God the Father and the redemptive work of the Son
If we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, we shall build with the proper materials on Christ as the only foundation
We need to apply Paul's word about taking heed how we build on the unique foundation to the situation among Christians today
Do you think that when the Lord Jesus comes back most believers will have a large amount of gold, silver, and precious stones?
Among today's Christians there is an abundance of natural things, but very little of the precious materials suitable for God's building
What is needed is that we digest the messages and have our eyes opened to see the revelation in these chapters
Eventually, by the growth in life we shall be transformed and become precious materials-gold, silver, and precious stones-for God's building
If by the mingled spirit we build with these precious materials, we shall be carrying on a proper work for the Lord's recovery
As a result, when the Lord comes back, our work will pass the test, and we shall receive the reward to enjoy the coming kingdom
If our work is done in Christ, with Christ, for Christ, and is even Christ Himself, it will pass the test of fire
In verse 1 Paul says, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ'
Fleshy denotes being made of flesh; fleshly denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh and partaking of the character of the flesh
If we were to speak such a strong word to the saints today, many would no doubt be offended and refuse to listen any further
Before you came into the church life, you may have been a Christian for years, yet you had never heard a message on drinking
Although spiritual drinking is vital to the Christian life, this matter is almost wholly neglected by Christians today
In some feasts there may be as many as twenty different courses including various meats, fish, fowl, vegetables, and soups
Whenever we breathe in the spiritual air by calling, 'O Lord Jesus,' we also partake of the water that is in the air
If you breathe in the Lord, drink of Him, and eat Him, you will not only be nourished, but you will also be healed
From reading verses 6 and 7, we may get the impression that only certain ones like Paul and Apollos can plant and water
We should not think that only the leading ones or those who share in the ministry of the Word can do the planting and the watering
A brother who does the work of planting may feel that he should not water what he has planted, regarding that as the work of another brother
Some may not water other believers because they are afraid that they will damage them by watering them too much
We can partake of the Lord by pray-reading, by attending the meetings, and by having fellowship with the saints
If we are one with the Lord in our feeding, planting, and the watering, the Lord will come in spontaneously to cause others to grow in life
After referring to feeding, drinking, eating, planting, watering, and growing, Paul says in 3:9, 'You are God's farm, God's building'
The believers who have been regenerated in Christ with God's life are God's cultivated land, a farm in God's new creation to grow Christ
As those who have believed in Christ and received Him, we are no longer like land that is uncultivated or wild
The more our natural life is reduced and the more Christ increases within us, the easier it will be for us to coordinate with others
According to their concept, because they have been built together with these ones, it is not possible for them to leave that locality
We need to understand Paul's word about Christ as the foundation according to the context of the first three chapters of 1 Corinthians
As we trace this connection backwards, we eventually come to the matter of the planters and the waterers being one
In verse 7 Paul says, 'So that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God'
The connection between verses 4 and 11 is this: Saying that we are of a certain person is to lay another foundation
Those who said I am of Paul were laying Paul as a foundation and those who declared I belong to Apollos were laying him as a foundation
Although we in the Lord's recovery do not lay other foundations in an outward way, we may still have our preferences
Whenever a saint moves from one local church to another, this should be purely according to the Lord's leading
As we have seen, the true building is to become reduced in our natural life and to have Christ increased within us
Will you want to go to a place where the elders are happy and the church does not present any hardships to you?
The result of this genuine growth and building is that we do not have preferences for any person, matter, or thing
If this is our condition, then wherever we may be, we shall coordinate with all the saints, no matter whether they are kind or coarse
As we consider all these things, we shall realize that 1 Corinthians is a precious book, a book filled with treasures
Praise the Lord for what we have seen of the feeding, the drinking, the eating, the planting, the watering, and the growing!
We are also thankful for what we have seen regarding the farm, the building, the foundation, transformation, and the temple of God
According to our natural concept, a farm is a matter of life, but a building is a composition of lifeless materials
He goes on to mention planting and watering, after which he tells us that it is God alone who gives the growth
In today's Christianity there are many other foundations, but there is virtually no building upon the foundation already laid
We had to declare to those in the denominations that we could not have any foundation other than Christ Himself
In verse 12 Paul refers to two ways of building But if anyone builds on the foundation gold silver precious stones wood grass stubble
The first way is to build with gold, silver, and precious stones; the second way is to build with wood, grass, and stubble
Using an example from the insect world, we may compare ourselves to a caterpillar in a cocoon in the process of becoming a butterfly
On the one hand, we are still a caterpillar; on the other hand, there are signs that we are becoming a butterfly
Believers may think that if they love the Lord, are close to the Lord, and walk with the Lord, then everything is all right
They may not realize, however, that they are still under certain veils, and that these veils insulate them from the Lord's transfusion
Whenever we behold Him in a direct way without any veil, without any insulation, we experience His transfusion
The Lord Jesus also used metaphors and parables in His teaching, for example, when He said, 'I am the bread of life'
When food is eaten, digested, and assimilated, a new substance is added into our being to replace and discharge the old substance
He knew that if they would eat and drink properly, they would be transformed and have a healthy spiritual complexion
The church should not be a place where people buy cosmetics; on the contrary, it must be the Lord's restaurant where His people can eat
The transfusion of the Lord into us can also be illustrated by the transmission of electricity into a child's toy
Our Christian life is a life of transfusion; it is a life of continually having the Lord infuse Himself into us
Because the Body of Christ is organic, the more we grow and are transformed, the more we are built up as the Body
Referring to Christ as the unique foundation, Paul says in 3:10, 'But let each one take heed how he builds upon it'
In verse 12 he goes on to say, 'But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble'
There are three because these materials refer to the Three of the Trinity, to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Gold, the first of the precious materials mentioned by Paul, refers to the first of the Trinity, God the Father
The more we receive of Him, the more His element transforms us metabolically and causes us to be constituted of Himself
When Christ becomes our redemption, He brings us back to God, terminates our natural life, and replaces us with Himself
Following this, the third of the Triune God, the Spirit, works both within us and in our circumstances to transform us into precious stones
We should not be surprised when even our children are used to press us and burn us so that we may become precious stones
We praise the Lord that we are receiving the Lord's nourishment and are also undergoing the process of transformation
If we have been built up in a genuine way, there will be no opinions, disputations, strifes, comparisons, preferences, or choices
We praise the Lord that, to some degree at least, the churches in the Lord's recovery are being built up in this way
Do not expect that this work of transformation and building will be carried out on a large scale involving a very large number of Christians
Regarding the building, first we must gather the materials, and then the materials become part of the building
On the positive side, he indicates that they should build on the foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones
For the Corinthians to say that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas was to lay another foundation and thus to mar the temple
The problem with the Corinthians was that they had other foundations consisting of their preferences and choices
According to the context, we defile the temple of God when we boast in men and say that we are of a particular person
As we shall see, at the end of chapter three Paul points out that all things and all servants of the Lord are ours
In 3:18 Paul refers to those who think themselves to be wise, and in verse 19 he says that the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God
Corinthians 3:17 says, 'If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which you are'
To destroy the temple of God means to build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble, as described in verse 12
We must take heed not to allow the wood, the grass, and stubble-our nature, our being, and our evil doings-to be brought into the church
The reason for this lack is that too much of our nature, being, and doings have been brought into the church life
It is very difficult to find any use for stubble, but certain kinds of wood may be useful and also have a good appearance
Some of those who labored on the mission field can testify that the more they worked, the more they remained in darkness
Along with learning not to bring our nature, being, and doings into the church, we must also learn not to have preferences for any persons
If we exalt a certain person, we shall mar, defile, destroy, the temple of God, and we shall suffer God's punishment
The apostle's thought here centers mainly on those Greek believers who highly esteemed the wisdom of their philosophy
In verse 18 Paul charges the one who thinks himself to be wise in this age to become foolish that he may become wise
To become foolish here is to forsake the wisdom of philosophy and receive the simple word concerning Christ and His cross
The Corinthian believers said they were of Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas , but Paul says he, Apollos, and Cephas are of them; all are theirs
Have you ever realized that the negative condition of the church in your locality is yours and that it works good for you?
Those who are dissatisfied with a certain local church and move to another place do not experience the growth in life as a result
Since all things are ours and work for us, we should not be so foolish as to have personal preferences and choices
All things are ours for the church, the church is for Christ to be His Body, and Christ is for God to be His expression
In the light of this word we should not exalt anyone and we should not have any preferences or choices concerning persons matters or things
In 4:1 Paul says, 'In this way let a man account of us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God'
It means a dispensing steward, a household administrator, one who dispenses the household supply to its members
The second mystery, revealed in the book of Ephesians and explained in it, especially in chapter three, is the mystery of Christ
When in 4:1 Paul refers to the mysteries of God, he means Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
We have pointed out that the Greek word for stewards in 4:1 is of the same root as the word economy or dispensation used elsewhere
The place of a steward in God's family may be illustrated by the function of a steward in a wealthy family in ancient times
In 4:1 Paul says, 'In this way let a man account of us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God'
In these verses Paul charges us not to boast in men, for all things are ours, we are Christ's, and Christ is God's
He regarded it as a very small matter to be examined by the Corinthians or by man's day, and he would not examine himself
Certain sisters, if they learn that others have criticized them, may not be able to sleep well for a long period of time
If we are bothered by criticism, it indicates that it is a great thing, not a small thing, for us to be examined by others
The elders are criticized not mainly by those outside the church, but primarily by the brothers and sisters in the church
We may compare criticism to hot peppers: hot peppers are difficult to eat at first, but eventually one may become accustomed to them
If the elders all examine themselves in this way, they will feel that they are not qualified to be elders and will certainly try to resign
Now he transfers that figure to himself and Apollos, that is, he applies it figuratively to himself and Apollos
Some translators and expositors think that the expression 'what has been written' refers to the writings of the Old Testament
Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthian believers, may be puffed up on behalf of the one against the other
If you have something which makes you different from others or distinct from others, that is something you have received from God
Speaking very faithfully, Paul says to them, 'I would that you really did reign, that we also might reign with you'
Paul says that God has set forth the apostles last, because the Corinthians were acting as if they were already kings
The criminals were regarded as nothing, for they were the lowest of people, those who had committed crimes deserving the death penalty
Paul uses this as a metaphor to illustrate that the apostles have been set forth by God to be the last show, the last exhibition
The apostles considered themselves as criminals doomed to death before the world, not as kings destined to reign like the Corinthians
Paul also tells the Corinthians that the apostles had become 'a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men'
As we shall see in the next message, this is related to their becoming 'the offscouring of the world' and 'the scum of all things'
We also should be like the apostles in verse 9-criminals doomed to death and a spectacle both to angels and to men
We in the recovery must give others the impression that we are as criminals condemned to death and a spectacle to the whole universe
He was rebuking, instructing, correcting, adjusting, and disciplining the believers, but he was doing all this in a very intimate manner
When man is mingled with God in doing a certain thing, that is simultaneously both God's doing and man's doing
The last act, the last show, was that of condemned criminals fighting with wild beasts for the entertainment of the people
When Paul says, 'I would that you really did reign,' he indicates that the Corinthian believers were not actually reigning as kings
Far from reigning as kings, they were as criminals doomed to fight with wild beasts for people's entertainment
We see a father rebuking, instructing, correcting, and even disciplining his mistaken children in an intimate way
Paul did not say that they were philosophers because of Christ; he declares that they were fools because of Christ
The apostles while ministering Christ appeared to be weak, for they used no strength or power of their natural being
The fleshly Corinthian believers were strong, claiming prominence among the believers by exercising their natural ability
They have become extremely successful, but we have become the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things
We have been made a spectacle to angels and to men, we are like criminals sentenced to death, and we are scum and offscouring
The ways here refer to the ways in which the apostle conducted himself as he taught the saints in every church
According to the New Testament way of speaking, Paul inserted the words 'if the Lord wills' to indicate that the Lord may not send him there
A spirit of meekness here refers to the apostle's regenerated spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit
Sisters, if you cannot be angry with your husband one minute and meek toward him the next, your spirituality is not genuine
If you need several hours to turn from your anger and become happy with your husband, you have only a man-made spirituality
The elders may give messages on spirituality, but they may not know how to be genuinely spiritual with one another
He could ask in verse 21 whether they wanted him to come to them with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness
On the one hand, he may be quick to become angry; on the other hand, he will be just as quick to turn from his anger
If this word were not in the Bible, none of us would accept such a statement as worthy of being in the Scriptures
Does it sound biblical or spiritual to ask whether we should come with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness?
Although verse 21 may not sound like a very scriptural way of speaking, it is a verse full of the weight of life
Those who are clever, political, and who never offend others and never make mistakes cannot build up the church
A begetting father, one who imparts life to others, must be as a criminal condemned to death in the sight of man
The first problem dealt with in chapters one through four is the matter of division which is mainly related to the natural life of the soul
Morally speaking, this problem, involving incest between a brother and his stepmother, is more gross than the former
From reading these chapters we see that there were divisions among the Corinthians because they were very much in the natural mind
In verse 2 Paul says And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned that the one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst
To remove someone from the fellowship of the church can be compared to removing a decayed or rotten piece of wood from a building
The apostle, as a spiritual person, behaved in his spirit, in contrast to the Corinthians, who behaved either in the soul or in the flesh
As the Corinthian believers were meeting together, Paul exercised his spirit to be with them and to judge the evil one and to remove him
Such a disease could bring about the destruction of the flesh so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
The Corinthian believers, in spite of the confusions and such a gross sin as incest among them, were boasting and glorying
On the one hand, we have the side of Christ; on the other hand, we have the side of what we are in our fallen nature
The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life
In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul compares the believers at Corinth, and himself as well, to the children of Israel
The children of Israel did not live individualistically; on the contrary, they lived, camped, traveled, and fought battles together
In writing this Epistle, Paul was endeavoring to bring the distracted Corinthians back to the central vision of God's economy
We must help others see that the reason they have been distracted is that they have turned from the central vision to something else
Paul had already judged such an evil one, and he expected the believers at Corinth to do the same and to remove that one from their midst
A fornicator is not merely one who commits fornication as David did in the Old Testament; he is a person who lives in that sin
If he is willing to do this and if he brings forth the fruit of repentance, the church will certainly forgive him
If he remains in that particular sin and becomes a kind of person who lives in it, he must be removed from the fellowship of the church
We need to see that, as those who have experienced the Passover, we should now enjoy continually the feast of unleavened bread
If we consider all these matters, we shall have a clear understanding of how to deal with an evil person in the church life
We have seen that after dealing with the soul and the lustful flesh, Paul turns to the matter of going to secular law
The reason we claim our rights is that instead of living by the mingled spirit, we live in the soul and in the flesh
The sequence is that first we have a soulish life, then the lusts of the flesh, and then the claiming of our rights
In 6:1 Paul asks, 'Does any one of you, having a case against another, dare to be judged before the unrighteous and not before the saints'?
Paul seems to be saying, 'If you will be able to judge great things, are you not able to judge the small things today?
Things of this life' indicates that judgment over the angels by the saints will be in the future, not in this age
The angels mentioned in these verses and those referred to in Ephesians 2:2; 6:12; and Matthew 25:41 must be the evil angels
In verse 4 Paul says If then you have judgments as to things of this life do you set them to judge who are little esteemed in the church
In verses 7 and 8 Paul says, 'Already, therefore, it is altogether a defeat for you that you have lawsuits among yourselves
Paul asks why the believers were not willing to be wronged, why they were not willing to learn the lesson of the cross
The claiming of rights issues from the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the flesh results from living in the soul
When we live in the soul, the lusts will come in, and when the lusts come in, we shall insist on our rights and claim them
In verse 9 Paul asks a question related to the kingdom of God Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God
When Paul speaks of the unrighteous, to whom does he refer-to the one who wrongs others or to the one who is wronged?
According to the Lord's word in Matthew, we must be absolutely righteous if we are to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord
To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment
Washing, sanctifying, and justifying are not by the blood in an objective way, as in 1 John 1:7, Hebrews 10:29, and Romans 3:24-25
We are washed from sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God
If Paul had said that we were washed, sanctified, and justified in the precious blood of Christ, this would be much easier to understand
We may find it hard to believe that certain of the Corinthians had actually been washed, sanctified, and justified
At the time a person believes in the Lord Jesus and receives Him, he is washed in the blood and also sanctified and justified by the blood
When we live a life that is clean, sanctified, and justified, we experience something subjective regarding these things
In the New Testament 'in the name of the Lord' actually means in the Lord Himself, for the name denotes the Person
At the time we were saved, we probably called on the Lord's name spontaneously and unconsciously, without being taught to do this
When we no longer called on the Lord, the subjective experience of the washing, sanctifying, and justifying was no longer ours
According to verse 11 we are washed sanctified and justified not only in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but also in the Spirit of our God
According to chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the name cannot be separated from the Spirit
By experience we know that when we call on the name of the Lord, we get the Person of the Lord and that the Person of the Lord is the Spirit
If we continue to call on the name of the Lord, enjoying His name and His Spirit, we are daily washed, sanctified, and justified
Now we should be saints who are subjectively washed, sanctified, and justified and are prepared to inherit the coming kingdom
He deals with soulish desires and aspirations; second, with the fleshly lusts; and third, with the claiming of rights
In this message we come to Paul's dealing with the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body, the fourth matter covered in this Epistle
Abusive eating, like the eating of sacrifices to idols, causes the weak brothers to stumble , and excessive eating damages our body
If mankind is to continue on earth for the fulfillment of God's purpose, there is the need for eating and for marriage
They place it with the following two sections, the sections on marriage and the problem of eating idol sacrifices
We have seen that soulish people open the door to the lusts of the flesh and that fleshly people will insist on claiming their rights
In the church life we all must learn to deny the soul; that is, not to give any ground, occasion, or opening for the soul to do anything
As we consider these matters, we realize that the sequence in which Paul deals with the problems in Corinthians is marvelous
The Greek word rendered lawful literally means under my power of choice to do; hence, permissible, allowable, lawful
Paul's thought may be that all things are lawful, but not all things help us to remain in the central lane of God's economy
All things are lawful, but not all things help us in bearing the cross or are profitable in experiencing Christ
You may be free to do certain things, but those things will not help you in the church life, and they will not strengthen your prayer life
Verse 12 may be considered a proverb that governs the apostle's dealings with some problems in the following section, from 6:13 through 11:1
When you consider whether or not to do a certain thing, you should ask if you are under the power or control of that thing
In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, 'Foods are for the belly and the belly for foods; but God will bring to nothing both it and them'
The reason for this is that the abuse of freedom in the matter of eating is not caused by the food; it is caused by the belly
He feeds it with material food and gives it His resurrection life , which swallows its death element with its weakness and sickness
On the one hand, Paul says that the belly is for food; on the other hand, he tells us that the body is not for fornication
Although Paul says that the body is for the Lord and the Lord for the body, he does not say that God is either for the belly or for foods
Our body is destined to participate in the Lord's glorious body in resurrection and to be raised incorruptible
In verses 13 and 14 we have a dual promise: first, that the Lord is for the body; second, that God will raise up the body
We know from Romans 8:11 that even today our mortal body can receive the supply of resurrection life and be sustained by it
In verse 15 Paul says that our bodies are members of Christ, and in verse 17 he says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit
If we claim that our oneness with the Lord is physical and not spiritual, we fall into serious error, even heresy
According to 1 Corinthians 15, resurrection is actually the growth of a seed which has been sown into the ground
In the context of dealing with the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body, Paul opens up these matters in a marvelous way
Due to the influence of traditional theology and practice, most Christians are not able to digest a verse like 6:17
They may have a great deal of room in them for such matters as holiness, victory, power, miracles, and speaking in tongues
Should you speak to them of the vision of God's economy, they would not be able to understand what you are saying
If this is our situation, we may read 1 Corinthians 6 again and again without being impressed by verses 15 and 17
If you read the early issues of The Stream magazine, you will see many of the messages are centered on the spirit
How marvelous that our bodies are members of Christ, that we are one spirit with the Lord, and that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit!
Certain brothers may use parts of the Life-study Messages as materials for speaking, but still not see the central vision
If we pay attention to things other than God's economy, there is the danger that we would actually help the saints to be distracted
We shall testify that we are one spirit with the Lord and that our bodies are members of Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit
We are still short of experience, still very limited in our capacity to receive these things and understand them
Head covering is related to Christ as the Head, and the Lord's table is related to the church as Christ's Body
These five matters form a second group and are all related to spiritual things concerning God's administration
The more we consider the sequence in which Paul deals with problems in this Epistle, the more we realize the significance of this sequence
In chapters five and six Paul deals with the matters of gross sin, the claiming of rights, and the abuse of human freedom
They concentrate on Paul's commands for wives to submit themselves to their husbands and for husbands to love their wives
Although Christians pay attention to verses about submission and love, who pays adequate attention to Paul's word about keeping the feast?
Do the professors in Bible schools and seminaries teach their students what it means to keep the feast and how to keep the feast?
In 6:13 and 14 Paul says, 'Foods are for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God will bring to nothing both it and them
God has raised up the Lord bodily, and our body will participate in the Lord's glorious body in resurrection and be raised incorruptible
According to Romans 6:9, 'Christ having been raised from among the dead dies no more; death lords it over Him no more'
If we would understand how the Lord today is for our body and how in the future God will resurrect our body we need to understand Romans 811
If you look at the electric meter in the meeting hall, you will realize that electricity is being transmitted into the building
In the same principle, the heavenly electricity of Christ's resurrection life is flowing into our mortal bodies
Notice that here Paul does not say merely that we are members of Christ; he declares that our bodies are members of Christ
Christ indwells our spirit, and from our spirit spreads throughout our inner being, thereby making His home in our hearts
Such a union with the resurrected Christ can only be in our spirit, for Christ today is the life-giving Spirit and is now with our spirit
Another crucial matter related to this is Paul's word in 6:14 that the Lord 'will raise up us through His power'
We have pointed out that even now the Spirit of the resurrected Christ who dwells in our spirit gives life to our body
Since this is the key, we must exercise and practice to experience the Lord as the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit
If we exercise ourselves to experience this and enjoy it, we shall open the door for the Lord to impart life to our physical bodies
When our body becomes a member of the indwelling Christ, it automatically becomes the temple, the dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit
If you get into the depths of these verses, your life, ministry, and service in the church will be affected in a revolutionary way
Because the Corinthians were so devoted to their culture and philosophy, they had many questions about marriage
It is dangerous, however, to philosophize about our married life, for this can lead to separation or even divorce
Of analyzing our married life, we should simply enjoy it, praising the Lord and thanking Him for the spouse He has given us
Just as every Christian has had doubts concerning his salvation, so every married person has had doubts about married life
He desires them not to marry but to remain as he that they also may be absolute for the Lord's interests without distraction
If a person does not have the gift not to marry and yet deliberately refrains from marrying he will face difficulties and may damage himself
In verse 26 Paul says, 'I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is'
The Greek word for present may also mean that the presence of a certain thing foreshadows and inaugurates something to come
The present necessity or distress indicates more anguish to come, as prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 24:8, 19, and 21
In verse 9 Paul says, 'But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn'
The same Greek word is used in 9:25 for athletes abstaining from sensual indulgences during preparation for the games
In verses 13 and 14 Paul says, 'And a wife who has an unbelieving husband and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband
In verse 14 Paul speaks of an unbelieving husband being sanctified by the wife and an unbelieving wife being sanctified by the husband
Since we do not know whether we shall save our unbelieving husband or wife we should not insist that they remain with us nor that they leave
Another principle here is to care for the things of the Lord and for the Lord's interests without having any other care
In verse 33 Paul points out that the one who is married cares for the things of the world and how to please his wife
It was not Paul's intention to put a noose on the saints, but that they may wait on the Lord without distraction
Then both he who gives his own virginity in marriage does well, and he who does not give it in marriage will do better'
Then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better'
By setting forth all these principles, Paul answered the questions concerning marriage raised by the philosophical believers at Corinth
To answer the questions raised by the Corinthian believers, Paul sets forth a number of basic principles concerning married life
We have pointed out that 1 Corinthians 7 is an answer to questions written to Paul by the philosophical believers at Corinth
In answering the questions raised by the Corinthians concerning married life, Paul was simple, direct, frank, and genuine
We know this by the fact that in answering certain questions Paul followed the principle of not initiating anything or changing anything
He made it very clear to the Corinthians that they should not initiate any action or change their status in any way
If we change our status or initiate any action this is an indication that we are not one with God and that we do not want to be one with Him
If we like to be one with God and are actually one with Him, we shall not initiate any change, especially change related to married life
In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul makes it very clear to the Corinthians that they should not change their status or initiate anything
In verse 12 he says, 'If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her'
The way the Corinthians thought and spoke about marriage indicated that among them there was a great deal of human initiative
In answering their questions, Paul indicates strongly that in the matter of marriage we should not initiate anything
It is important to see this principle of being absolutely one with the Lord in all circumstances, situations, and conditions
The advice given by marriage counselors reveals that they are independent of God and even rebellious against Him
Apparently we are in a particular circumstance; actually that circumstance is God coming to us and God with us
In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul's spirit is expressed in the way he deals with the questions asked by the Corinthian believers
According to my experience, Pentecostal believers more often sing portions of the Old Testament than they do portions of the New Testament
Do you know of any Christians today who sing about being one spirit with the Lord, or about their bodies being members of Christ?
These believers live on the surface; they have never touched the depths of the divine revelation in the New Testament
On the day of Pentecost the apostles and disciples also began to speak according to the principle of incarnation
The word command here implies that the apostle in his teaching has authority to give commands to the believers
The answer to these questions is that Paul realized that he was one with the Lord and that what he spoke was the Lord's word
Even when he did not claim to have a word from the Lord, because he was one with the Lord, whatever he said was the Lord's word
Although Paul is careful to add not the Lord whatever he says in the following verses is part of the divine revelation in the New Testament
Concerning virgins not marrying, he says he has no commandment of the Lord, but he gives his opinion in the following verses
He dares to do this because he has received mercy of the Lord to be faithful to the Lord's interests, and he is really one with the Lord
Some readers of 1 Corinthians may think that Paul was too strong in giving his opinion when he had no commandment from the Lord
Which one of us would dare to say that we have no commandment of the Lord concerning a certain matter, but that we give our opinion?
We see the highest spirituality, the spirituality of a person who is so one with the Lord that even his opinion expresses the Lord's mind
He realized that if a brother or a sister remained unmarried, that one would be spared the pressing caused by the present necessity
All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation, that is, God and man, man and God, becoming one
In the Old Testament, as we have pointed out, the word of Jehovah came unto a prophet , the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God
What we utter or express will be our thought, our opinion, but it will also be something of the Lord because we are one with Him
In order for our body to be the temple of the Holy Spirit our entire being-spirit, soul, and body-must be involved
Because his body is a member of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit, he will not use it for any purpose other than that ordained by God
In chapter eight Paul deals with our eating, a matter that is even more practical than the matter of married life
One is oida signifying the inward subjective consciousness the intuitive knowledge as used in John 855 1 Corinthians 122 2 Timothy 112 31415
The outward, objective knowledge that puffs up comes from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the source of death
We have pointed out that the knowledge which puffs up and the love which builds up are related to the two trees in the garden of Eden
In verse 3 Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians that they do not need so much knowledge; instead, they need to love God
In verse 3 Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, 'You believers at Corinth need to realize that God does not know you
How can the omnipotent and omnipresent Lord say that He does not know someone when He knows everything about us?
The reason the Lord can say such a thing is that the statement I never knew you in Matthew 723 means I never approved of what you have done
Not only is He our Father in regeneration, but He is the Father of all created things, for all things have come out of Him
In verse 6 Paul also says that to us there is 'one Lord, Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and we through Him'
Our God the Father is the unique source of all things and our Lord Jesus Christ is the unique means through whom all things came into being
Concerning the Lord, all things are through Him in creation, and we are through Him in returning unto the Father
The ex-idol worshippers who are now believers in Christ, being accustomed to the idol until now, lack the knowledge that an idol is nothing
Verse 8 says, 'But food will not commend us to God; neither if we do not eat are we lacking, nor if we eat do we excel'
The issue does not concern the matter of right or wrong, but whether or not a certain thing commends us to God
Verse 11 says, 'For the one who is weak is being destroyed by your knowledge, the brother because of whom Christ died'
In verse 12 Paul declares, 'And thus, sinning against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ'
The way Paul dealt with the question of eating idol sacrifices indicates that his view of the matter is related to Christ and the Body
In the church life in the Lord's recovery, we need to follow the New Testament principles to simplify situations and eliminate complications
We know this not because he says so explicitly; we know it by the instructions he gives the Corinthians concerning married life
According to Paul's realization, if a certain thing does not commend us to God, there is no need for us to engage in it
He answers the questions raised by the Corinthians not with a yes or a no, but according to what he is and according to his own practice
If everyone in a local church had a life and practice to match that of Paul, there would be no questions, problems, or complications
To deal with the situation, Paul must take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers
Because Paul had begotten the Corinthian believers in the Lord through the gospel , he was surely an apostle to them
The sufficient result of the apostle's efficient work is not only an evidence, a proof, but also a seal of his apostleship
The fact that he speaks about his apostleship indicates that the Corinthian believers also had a problem regarding Paul's apostleship
The Corinthians were actually examining Paul; they were investigating him to determine whether or not he was an apostle
The colon at the end of verse 3 in the text indicates that the following verses are intended to be Paul's defense
The complicated philosophical believers at Corinth made it necessary for him to speak in such a strong, direct way
For our sake; for it was written that the plower should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope of partaking'
In verse 11 Paul says, 'If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your fleshly things'?
We did not use this right; but we bear all things that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ'
Paul was like a vessel containing everything the Corinthians had done to him and also like a roof covering them
Problems among Christians are caused not only by their complications, but even the more, by their lack of purity
If someone suspects that a person sitting nearby will steal from him, this may indicate that he himself is a thief
In the same principle, because the Corinthians were not pure, they suspected that Paul was not pure and that he was taking advantage of them
Such a word exposed those Corinthians who thought that Paul wrote in this way so that he would be given some support or supply
If Paul's purpose in writing chapter nine had been to be supplied by the Corinthians, Paul would have been impure
In the church life today many problems are apparently due to complications; actually, the problems are caused by impureness
In writing to the believers at Corinth he revealed himself as a person who was one with God and absolutely pure
Corinthians 12:16 indicates that some of the believers at Corinth thought that Paul was gaining material profit from them through craft
If our motives are not pure, we may begin to have problems with the church after making such a declaration and consecration
Paul was pure because he knew experientially what it was to be crucified with Christ and to be one spirit with the Lord
Because he was pure, he could perform spiritual surgery on the believers at Corinth without contaminating them
In verse 20 Paul inserts the parenthetical statement 'not being myself under law' in order to indicate that he was not under law
According to verse 21, to those without law Paul became as one without law that he might gain those without law
In Greek the expression 'in the law' is ennomos, in law, that is, in the sphere, the limit, of law; hence, under law, subject to law
To the Gentiles who did not have the Mosaic law Paul became as one without law not being without the law of God but within the law of Christ
The Greek word rendered fellow-partaker is rich in meaning; it also means a joint participant, cooperator, copartner
The apostle is not only a fellowpartaker a joint participant enjoying the gospel but also a cooperator a copartner laboring for the gospel
In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, 'Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
With this prize in view, the apostle charged the Corinthian believers to run the race that they might obtain the reward
The context indicates that preaching here refers to the preaching of the reward as an incentive to the Christian runners
Paul was afraid lest having preached the gospel regarding the reward to others, he himself would be disapproved by the Lord
In the New Testament we are told definitely that God has prepared not only salvation for us, but also has a reward for the faithful ones
In the next verse Paul explains, 'If anyone's work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire'
In these verses we see a brother who was absolutely faithful to the Lord's commission and faithful in running the Christian course
Corinthians 10:1-13 is a special section of the Word, a portion written with the history of the children of Israel as the background
Paul wrote this Epistle not only according to the situation at Corinth but also with the history of the children of Israel as the background
In the Old Testament we have a type, a picture, of God's economy, whereas in the New Testament God's economy is fulfilled
In both 1 Corinthians and Hebrews Paul presents a clear view of the history of Israel as a type and portrait of the history of the church
If we take Christ as our life and practice being one spirit with Him, we, like Paul, shall be pure and faithful
He could deal with the problem in such a way because he was full of Christ, one with the Lord, and saturated with the life-giving Spirit
The cloud that covered the children of Israel typifies the Spirit of God being with the New Testament believers
They were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and we are baptized unto Christ in the Spirit and in water
In verse 4 Paul says And all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them and the rock was Christ
The spiritual drink here refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock , which typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink
For our race, we should all drink the same spiritual drink, not drinking anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit
Paul was bold to tell us that the physical rock of Exodus 17:6 was a spiritual rock and that this rock was Christ
Verses 1 through 4 speak of the children of Israel in a positive way, but verses 5 through 11 picture them in a negative way
In verse 5 a strong word of warning Paul says But with most of them God was not well pleased for they were strewn along in the wilderness
Literally, this means that they were strewn down along the ground; that is, they were laid low on the ground by slaying
In one day alone, more than twenty thousand were slain and strewn along the ground, their bodies scattered in the wilderness
The Lord loved Moses, regarding him as an intimate friend, but for the sake of His government He could not allow Moses to go into the land
In verse 6 Paul continues, 'Now these things occurred as types of us, that we should not be lusters after evil things, as they also lusted'
We have seen that 1 Corinthians takes the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament as a type of the New Testament believers
In chapters five, seven, and eight they have experienced Christ as their Passover and have begun to keep the feast of unleavened bread
They are now eating the spiritual food and drinking the spiritual drink that they may take their journey toward their good land
Verse 7 says, 'Neither become idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play'
When the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, they sat down to eat and drink, and they stood up to play
Whenever there is a holiday or a long weekend, they give themselves to play, to the pursuit of various kinds of entertainment
Verse 8 continues Neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed fornication and there fell in one day twentythree thousand
In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, 'Neither let us tempt the Lord, as some of them tempted and were destroyed by the serpents'
The murmuring of the children of Israel typified the negative speaking of the Corinthian believers against the apostle
Following this age is the kingdom age, when these examples in the Old Testament age will no longer serve for our Christian race
If you do not heed the warning of this type and walk in the light of this warning, you will miss the opportunity
For a Christian to die defeated by sin, the world, the flesh, lust, Satan, or anything evil is to fall in the wilderness
Of the word of righteousness, there are sugar-coated sermons which often encourage people to practice idolatry
In Matthew 6:13 the Lord Jesus teaches us to pray both to be delivered from evil and also not to be led into temptation
In Hebrews and 1 Corinthians he points out clearly that what happened to the children of Israel is a type of us
As we have seen, in 10:6 Paul, referring to the children of Israel, says, 'Now these things occurred as types of us'
With the Hebrews there was a shortage of faith, and with the Corinthians there was a shortage of the growth in life
Their experiences of Christ were all by their regenerated spirit mingled with the Spirit, who is the resurrected Christ
They were saved out of that fallen situation and brought to the mountain of God and to the dwelling place of God
Of the more than two million who came out of Egypt only Joshua and Caleb, along with the body of Joseph, entered into the good land
The correct answer to this question is that they were defeated temporarily, but ultimately they were victorious
It is common for Christians, under the influence of traditional theology, to ask others if they have been saved
A member of the tribe of Benjamin, for example, could have testified confidently that because he had enjoyed the Passover, he had been saved
They entered the land, they conquered the land, they fully possessed the land, and they had the enjoyment of the rich produce of the land
In the first section of the history of Israel every positive thing is a type of Christ or of something related to Christ
The manna, the smitten rock, the living water, and the tabernacle with its utensils and furnishings are all types
The first generation was made up of those who came out of Egypt, and the second, of those who entered the good land
Between the first baptism at the Red Sea and the second baptism at the Jordan River, the children of Israel were experiencing transformation
If you could have visited them after they had passed through the Red Sea, you may have wondered how they could be God's people
During the forty years between passing through the Red Sea and crossing the Jordan River, there were many dealings related to transformation
Because we are partly in the cocoon and partly out of it, sometimes we are discouraged and at other times we are encouraged
Transformation is a matter of eliminating the old generation, the old man, and putting on the new generation, the new man
You will praise Him for the fact that the butterfly, your new being, has been gradually emerging from its cocoon
The principle here is illustrated by a word in Exodus 23:27-30 concerning occupying the good land and driving out the Canaanites
Literally, the Greek words rendered idolatry are 'the idolatry,' referring to the idolatry involved in eating sacrifices to idols
In the same principle, by the word idolatry Paul does not merely mean graven images, but something much broader and more inclusive
In verse 16 Paul suddenly speaks of the cup of blessing: 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
Without any transition, Paul begins to speak of the cup of blessing, indicating that it is a fellowship of the blood of Christ
We need to investigate the meaning of the expressions 'a fellowship of the blood of Christ' and 'a fellowship of the body of Christ'
The apostle's thought here is to illustrate how eating and drinking make the eaters and drinkers one with what they eat and drink
The Corinthians should realize that their abusive eating of idol sacrifices actually makes them one with the demons behind the sacrifices
We should not think that the remainder of chapter ten has nothing to do with the type of Israel in verses 1 through 13
In verse 18 Paul surely means that the fellowship of the altar is a type of the fellowship of the blood and body of Christ
Since demons are the reality of idols, so the eating of sacrifices to idols makes the eaters their fellowshippers, their joint participants
If we participate in fellowship with demons, making ourselves one with them, we shall provoke the Lord to jealousy
The correct understanding of this section is that Paul talks about the Lord's table using idolatry as a background
In 10:7 he says, 'Neither become idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play'
With this understanding of idolatry as a background, we need to ask what Paul means by the expression 'the Lord's table'
God had promised to bring His people out of the land of Egypt into a good land, a land flowing with milk and honey
Both idolatry and the Lord's table are much more inclusive in meaning than what is indicated by the letters in black and white
In these verses Paul first speaks of one kind of table and then, apparently making a leap, of another kind of table
Even when Paul deals with a problem involving gross sin, the matter of incest, he reveals Christ in a marvelous way
We have pointed out that in dealing with married life, Paul also covers important matters related to being one spirit with the Lord
In chapters eight, nine, and ten, a section concerned with the eating of idol sacrifices, the revelation reaches the peak
Paul was not a shallow person, and in his writing he did not carry out the rescue of the believers at Corinth in a shallow way
The problems he deals with in this Epistle may seem rather shallow, but the way he deals with these things is profound
Because what we are teaching and experiencing regarding Christ is mysterious, unbelievers cannot understand what we are talking about
In Ephesians 3:18 he speaks of apprehending with all the saints 'what is the breadth and length and height and depth'
In 10:16 Paul again refers to fellowship: 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
Our understanding of the Lord's table has been limited by the influence of our religious background and also by our natural concepts
We may not have any realization in our spirit that by coming to the table and enjoying it, we are enjoying Christ as the all-inclusive land
Do you know how the children of Israel established the kingdom of God on earth and how they built the temple of God?
The riches of the land not only enabled the people to live; they also equipped them to fight and bring in the kingdom of God
These riches were also the supply for them to defeat the enemy, establish the kingdom of God, and build the temple of God
Christ is our good land, and the various aspects of the riches of Christ are typified by the produce of the land
Many of us have been attending the Lord's table for years, but we have never had this understanding of the table
The result of eating sacrifices to idols is that a person becomes one with demons and even filled and saturated with them
Those who have become the temple and the kingdom through the enjoyment of Christ are surely those who live Christ
Today people everywhere are practicing idolatry, for they are enjoying many things which are not the Lord Himself
Those who engage in worldly entertainments and who purchase many of the worldly things sold in department stores are practicing idolatry
The Lord's table is not only a matter of a meeting on the Lord's Day; this table should be our enjoyment every day, even continually
If we come to the Lord's table with this understanding, we shall come with a different spirit and a different realization
Today we are those gathered around the altar, enjoying whatever is offered on the altar for God's satisfaction
Using the history of the children of Israel as a background, Paul wrote to the Corinthian believers in an urgent way
We have given many messages on the riches of Christ, especially a series printed in the book The All-Inclusive Christ
In 10:23 Paul says, 'All things are lawful, but not all things are expedient; all things are lawful, but not all things build up'
Fully aware of these principles, Paul goes on to say in 10:24, 'Let no one seek his own profit, but that of another'
If a believer is criticized in this way for eating meat sacrificed to idols, he should refrain from eating that meat
In verse 31 Paul concludes, 'Whether therefore you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God'
The Greek words rendered, 'Give no occasion of stumbling,' may also be translated, 'Do not become a stumbling block'
Because Paul was a follower of Christ, it was right for the Corinthian believers, and all others, to follow him
Today my burden is that the Lord's people would be brought back to the central vision of Christ and the church
In considering these principles and this section of 1 Corinthians, we need to be focused on the central vision of Christ and the church
Before we do so, however, let us first consider four verses, two from 1 Corinthians and two from 2 Corinthians
We have been baptized organically into one Body in the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, not just the Spirit of God
The reason we love all the saints, regardless of race, culture, or nationality, is that we are organically united in life
We can be one Body because we have been baptized in the wonderful life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
Christ's becoming the life-giving Spirit implies all the steps of His process: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
The goal of this process is not incarnation, crucifixion, or even resurrection; the goal is the life-giving Spirit
After shedding His blood on the cross and dying for us, this One was buried and then entered into resurrection
Now as we drink this Spirit and are saturated with Him, we spontaneously become ministers of the new covenant, a covenant of the Spirit
At this point it will be helpful to see the Epistle of 1 Corinthians as a whole, to have an overview, a bird's-eye view, of the entire book
Paul, the apostle, burdened for that church, wrote this Epistle to clarify the situation by dealing with the problems one by one
There was division among the Corinthians because they were natural and lived according to their philosophical wisdom
God in His creation ordained that man should eat in order to exist and also that he should marry in order to propagate
In his daily living, especially in the matter of eating, he will be restricted and care for others, the church, and God's testimony
We shall solve the problems of division, the indulgence of the flesh, the claiming of personal rights, and the abuse of our rights
The problems among the Corinthians, however, were related not only to human living, but even the more to God's administration
Some were even so mistaken with respect to God's administration that they went so far as to say that there was no resurrection
In chapter eleven Paul speaks of the headship and of the Body, and in chapters twelve through fourteen, of the gifts
If the Body is to carry out God's administration, every member of the Body must have a gift for function according to God's operation
First we have the headship, then the Body, and then the gifts for the services that God's administration may be carried out
They have problems in the realm of human life, and they have problems in the realm of the divine administration
Some argued that Paul spoke concerning head covering because in his time there was such a custom among the people
Although this has been our practice for more than fifty years, we have never forced anyone to participate in such a practice
It is a fact that the Bible reveals that the church should have such a sign declaring that we are a people under God's headship
In verse 8 Paul gives us a second reason for head covering: 'For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man'
God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and then He opened his side, took out a rib, and used that rib to build a woman
Notice what Paul says in verses 11 and 12: 'However, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord
On the other hand, Paul says that the man is through the woman, for man comes into existence through his mother
We also should be balanced, realizing both that the woman is out of the man and that the man is through the woman
The apostle takes God's purpose in the creation of man and woman as another strong ground for his teaching of head covering
In verse 10 Paul continues, 'Therefore the woman ought to have authority on her head for the sake of the angels'
The archangel with his subordinates rebelled against Gods headship establishing his kingdom of darkness and became Satan Gods adversary
It is significant that Paul says that the woman ought to have authority on her head for the sake of the angels
Not only in the coming kingdom age in eternity shall we be under God's headship, but even in this rebellious age we submit to His authority
Paul is indicating that, judging according to the reasons he has given, it is not fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God
No matter how bold a sister may be, she would not feel peaceful if she were to assume authority over her husband
Some who debate about head covering claim that in chapter eleven head covering simply refers to a woman's long hair
If we read these verses carefully, we shall see that head covering is something in addition to a woman's long hair
In speaking about head covering, it is not our intention for the sisters to accept an outward practice merely in a doctrinal way
In verse 3 Paul first says that the head of every man is Christ, and then he points out that the head of the woman is the man
In Revelation we see that Christ, the slain Lamb, is absolutely under the headship of God for the carrying out of God's administration
As we have pointed out, the slain, resurrected, and ascended Lamb is taking the lead to submit Himself to the headship of God in the heavens
On earth there is an organism, the Body, constituted of those who have been redeemed and baptized into the Triune God
Now this One is in the heavens submitting Himself to God's headship for the carrying out of the divine administration
As members of the Body, we have a heavenly television within us by which we can see what is going on in the heavens
Now we must be the television to reflect what is taking place in the heavens so that others can see in us what is happening there
We praise the Lord that in many places there is a proper reflection of Christ's submission to the headship of God
Since Paul has already begun to talk about the Lord's table, why does he not go on directly to speak concerning the Lord's supper?
Why does he bring in the matter of headship or head covering after his word about the Lords table and before that about the Lords supper
In the first ten chapters of this Epistle Paul deals with problems related to the Christian life; he does not deal with God's administration
Concerning the remembrance of the Lord, Paul uses the term 'the table of the Lord' in 10:21 and 'the Lord's supper' in 11:20
Rather, we should ask why Paul speaks of the Lord's table in chapter ten and the Lord's supper in chapter eleven
Since Paul in this portion is speaking about the Lord's supper, the body here must also denote the body of Jesus
In verse 24 Paul quotes the word of the Lord Jesus: 'This is My body, which is for you; this do for the remembrance of Me'
We certainly are not working for the accomplishment of redemption, for redemption has been accomplished once for all by the Lord Jesus
When we come to the Lord's table, our concern is neither redemption nor the divine administration; our concern is for enjoyment
We may have a heart for our enjoyment of the table, the feast, but not have much of a heart for the Lord's remembrance
In 11:26 he says, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
If you do, then you must take care of the mystical Body, the means for Him to carry out God's administration on earth
For this reason, today's Christianity has become useless as far as the carrying out of the divine administration is concerned
The divisions among Christians not only paralyze the Body of Christ; they even cause the Body to be cut in pieces
We know that Jesus' physical body was given for the accomplishment of our redemption so that we may enjoy Him in fellowship
Lord, we also thank You that you have given Your body on the cross to bear our sins, to die for us, and to terminate the old creation
In order that God's administration may be carried out, we must care for the oneness of the unique mystical Body of Christ
To prove ourselves is to check whether we are eating the bread and drinking the cup in a way that is worthy or in a way that is unworthy
We should not drink it in a common, ordinary way, but drink it in a way which shows that we realize that it is different from ordinary drink
According to this heretical teaching, the bread and the wine in the cup actually become the body and blood of Christ
Although we reject transubstantiation, we must realize as we drink the cup and eat the bread that these are solemn, holy, and divine signs
Verse 29 says, 'For he who is eating and drinking, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body'
Proving ourselves is for the remembrance of the Lord; discerning the Body is mainly for the carrying out of God's administration
Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we should not just enjoy the Lord; we should also remember Him by proving ourselves
At the same time we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the unique mystical Body of Christ or if it signifies a division
If the bread signifies a certain divisive group or denomination, we should not take it, for we discern the Body
Although we are still small in number, the angels and demons know that our standing is different from that of divisive Christianity
Deep within we have the assurance that we are discerning the Body for the carrying out of God's administration on earth
We are also the heavenly television reflecting on earth what Christ is doing in the heavens for the divine administration
Verse 19 continues, 'For there must also be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you'
In verse 20 Paul says, 'When therefore you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper'
At the Lord's table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord's supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment
In verse 21 Paul declares, 'For in eating, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry, and another is drunk'
having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is for you; this do for the remembrance of Me'
Verse 26 continues, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
We remember the Person by declaring His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings
We should take the Lord's supper for the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back
In verse 28 Paul continues, 'But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup'
Verse 29 says, 'For he who is eating and drinking, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body'
To fail to discern the Lord's body is to fail to make a distinction between the bread, which signifies the Lord's body, and common food
In discerning the Body of Christ we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit
Our participation in the Lord's table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division either in practice or in spirit
The apostle's dealing with head covering is related to the Head ; his dealing with the Lord's supper is related to the Body
Regarding the Body of Christ, we must be properly regulated by the apostle's instruction without any confusion or division
Christ and the church-these two-are the controlling and directing factors of the apostle's dealings with the confused and disorderly church
He deals with the church's problems first by stressing Christ as God's center and our portion in chapters one through ten
From chapter eleven he goes on to the church and uses the matter of the church, the Body, as an inoculation against the church's disorder
Both Christ and the church are crucial to the carrying out of God's administration in His New Testament economy
To discern ourselves is to distinguish matters that concern ourselves, to form an accurate estimate of ourselves
In verse 32 Paul says, 'But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world'
If we keep ourselves under God's administration, we shall not be judged, corrected, disciplined, to be brought back to His administration
Corinthians 1124 and 25 say And having given thanks He broke it and said This is My body which is for you this do for the remembrance of Me
To have the Lord's supper for the remembrance of the Lord means that we have the supper for the purpose of remembering Him
To have the Lord's supper unto the remembrance of the Lord means that we have the supper with the result that we remember the Lord
It is possible that the result of our eating of the Lord's supper may also be condemnation instead of the remembrance of the Lord
To come to the Lord's supper with the intention of receiving satisfaction for ourselves is against the principle of His supper
To remember the Lord in this way is good, but it does not have anything to do with the kingdom, with God's administration
If our eating of the Lord's supper stops with this kind of remembrance, our partaking of the Lord's supper is too superficial
The genuine eating of the Lord's supper must result in the administration of God; it must result in the kingdom
Our eating of the Lord's supper will result in a full satisfaction to the Lord and also in the carrying out of the administration of God
Perhaps you are wondering how the eating of the Lord's supper can result in the carrying out of God's administration
As Christians, we have been saved, we have been born of God to be the children of God, and we have been brought into the kingdom of God
Through regeneration we have been brought into God's kingdom and have also become members of the Body of Christ
The answer is that we have been regenerated so that we may live a life for the kingdom of God and the Body of Christ
Many Christians love the Lord, but they do not realize that their life on earth is for God's kingdom and Christ's Body
If you understand this, you will know how eating of the Lord's supper may result in such a satisfaction to the Lord
Concerning the Lord's table and the Lord's supper, our understanding may still be under the influence of our religious background
Our mind may be so saturated with traditional thoughts and concepts that we have no capacity to take in anything new
To use a different illustration, our mind may be like an apartment building with a 'No vacancy' sign posted in front of it
In 11:26 Paul says, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
For the most part, Christians do not realize that at holy communion they should remember the Lord and not merely what He has done for us
We should not take for granted Pauls words Declare the Lords death until He comes and we should not understand them in a superficial way
In John 1224 the Lord Jesus says Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
In his early ministry Brother Nee emphasized that the New Testament teaches three important matters: the cross, the church, and the kingdom
Some among the Corinthian believers had become sick and others had died, simply because the Body had been divided
Without this bridge with the highway, there would be no way to go from one side of the gap, Christ's death, to the other side, God's kingdom
Now He is in the heavens carrying on His heavenly ministry so that he may come back to earth with the kingdom of His Father
As long as there is a people on earth responding to Christ in His heavenly ministry, there is a way for Him to bring God's kingdom to earth
Eating the supper reminds us to have a life in the church to bring in the kingdom for the satisfaction of the Lord Jesus
Many readers of the Bible have found it difficult to understand why Paul deals first with the Lord's supper and then with the gifts
If we would understand the connection between these two matters, we must see that they are related to God's administration
The divine administration is the secret to the five problems covered in the last six chapters of 1 Corinthians
If the church were only an assembly of believers coming together for fellowship, Satan would not hate the church so much
Suppose, however, we have a church in which only a few members function and the rest sit in the meetings without functioning
In verses 2 and 3 Paul continues, 'You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led
The apostle's thought here is that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless
No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, 'Jesus is accursed'; he would like to say and he is able to say, 'Lord Jesus'
No worshippers of God should be silent, but all should use their voices to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God
The governing principle of the gifts is to speak by our spirit with the Spirit, that is, to utter something with the Spirit in our spirit
In verse 2 Paul reminds them that when they were of the nations, of the Gentiles, they were 'led away to dumb idols'
Paul does not say they were led away to sins lusts or the world he says that they were led away to dumb idols in whatever way they were led
Paul's use of the adjective 'dumb' implies that both the idols and those who worship them are dumb, unable to speak
The literal rendering 'Lord Jesus' indicates not only an admission, but also an address, a calling on the Lord
Reports have come to us that a number of saints in a certain place have been helped by calling on the name of the Lord and by pray-reading
When we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles in 1970, the meetings always started well ahead of the scheduled time
Verse 3 says that when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say, 'Lord Jesus,' exalting Jesus as the Lord
But' there are differences in the gifts for the manifestation of the Spirit; there are diversities in these gifts
Verse 6 says, 'And there are distributions of operations, but the same God, Who is operating all things in all'
These operations are for the carrying out of God's administration, which is for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
In the past we have pointed out that in the New Testament there is just one ministry, and now we are speaking of ministries
All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit; that is, the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts
For profit means for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ's Body
The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching
They have seen a vision, a revelation, of Christ, and whatever they speak concerning Him is the word of wisdom
The word of knowledge is a word concerning spiritual things, in particular a word regarding what God is and does
These works of power are miracles, works of miraculous power other than healing, such as Peter raising Dorcas from death
Of course, it sometimes includes an element of prediction, of speaking for, speaking forth, and speaking beforehand
Paul concludes verse 10 by saying, 'To a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues'
The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit
The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life
They may seek the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit without realizing that the gifts of the Spirit are altogether for the Body
We need to be impressed with the fact that immediately after emphasizing the Spirit Paul turns to the Body and places a great emphasis on it
Verse 12 says For even as the body is one and has many members but all the members of the body being many are one body so also is Christ
Verse 11 says that one Spirit operates all the various aspects of His manifestation, distributing them to many believers individually
Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ
Today Pentecostal people talk a great deal about the baptism in the Spirit, but not nearly as much about being baptized into the Body
Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ
If we would have a proper appreciation of the spiritual gifts we need to see the three important matters of speaking the Spirit and the Body
In many cases they have received these gifts in vain because they use them for themselves and not for the Body
When we are full of the water of the Spirit, we have no choice but to let this water bubble out from within us
We all need to forget ourselves, our localities, our work, and our personal spirituality and be burdened by the Lord concerning His Body
In the next period of time the Lord would be able to accomplish a great deal for the carrying out of God's administration on earth
The churches throughout the earth would truly be heavenly televisions expressing what Christ is doing in His heavenly ministry
We have pointed out again and again that in chapter twelve Paul first emphasizes speaking, then the Spirit, and then the Body
For this we need much transformation , from the natural life to the spiritual, by the same Spirit, for the practical Body life
For the practical Body life we need to be transformed by the Spirit from the natural life to the spiritual life
God is using the church life in the Lord's recovery as a testimony of the oneness in the midst of the divisions
Not only have we been baptized in one Spirit; we have also been baptized into one Body and with a particular purpose-to drink one Spirit
Many Christians have only the 'wedding'-baptism; they do not have the 'married life'- the daily drinking of one Spirit
After making the transfer from the Spirit to the Body in verse 13, in verses 14 through 27 Paul talks about the body with the members
Those who are talented by birth, gifted by rebirth, and well educated may not be useful at all in the raising up of the proper church life
If we examine the history of the Lord's recovery, we shall see that those who care for the Body have been used by the Lord
Whoever depends on the Body and whoever is in the Body and for the Body, not putting their trust in the gifts, will be useful
It is sufficient that a small remnant take the standing of God's intention and be one with Him in His intention
We are not the Body in the original sense, but we are the Body in the recovered sense, in the sense of recovery
We are simply allowing Him to be the Administrator, and we follow the principle that the gifts must be for the Body
Verses 3 through 11 emphasize the Spirit, verses 12 through 27 emphasize the Body, and verses 28 through 31 emphasize administration
In chapter twelve in dealing with the gifts, four matters are emphasized: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, and administration
The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation, and who speak sometimes with inspired prediction
Speaking ushers us into the Spirit, the Spirit brings us into the Body, and the Body preserves us in the Spirit
Paul's fifth emphasis, the matter of love, is the way to use the gifts, the way to be in the Body, and the way to be for the Body
Rather, it comes between chapters twelve and fourteen and with them forms a portion in this Epistle dealing with the gifts
The first verse of chapter fourteen indicates this: 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy'
These chapters make up one unit, with chapter thirteen continuing chapter twelve and chapter fourteen continuing chapter thirteen
In Romans 12:6-8 Paul says that we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us and that we should exercise them accordingly
Although prophecies will be done away, tongues will cease, and knowledge will be done away, love will never fall away
As long as you have the divine life through regeneration, you also have love, for love is the expression of life, another form of life
Certain gifts are also related to life, for they are developed from the initial gifts: the Holy Spirit and the divine life
They needed to grow in life, expressed by love, by pursuing love, not the outward gifts, so that they might be spiritual
Love as the expression of the divine life does not rejoice over Satan's unrighteousness, but rejoices with God's truth
If we consider the fifteen virtues of love listed in these verses, we shall realize that love is nothing other than God Himself
All the gifts, whether prophecies, or tongues, or knowledge, are means for God's operation; they are not life to express God
The word means also 'a mirror,' but it is used for window, made, not of clear transparent glass, as now, but of semi-transparent materials'
Such a love causes us to grow in life for the development and use of the spiritual gifts, and is the excellent way to have the greater gifts
In chapter fourteen Paul comes to another main point: the superiority of a particular gift for the building up of the church
Among the many spiritual gifts, one is superior not for our work, maturity, or spiritual interests, but for the building up of the church
Paul's ultimate concern is not speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God's administration, or love as the excellent way to exercise the gifts
Because we fell away from God, there was the need for Christ to accomplish redemption in order to bring us back to God
Even if we had not fallen, it nevertheless would have been necessary for God to carry out a certain procedure to obtain the church
Some desire to have a gift of preaching, and others desire the miraculous gifts such as the gift of tongue-speaking or the gift of healing
Paul's emphasis, his main point, in chapter fourteen concerns what gift is best, not for us, but for the building up of the church
Love is the excellent way to experience the divine life and make it the content of the gift of prophecy for the building up of the church
The apostle's word in verses 2 through 6 gives a clear and definite view that speaking in tongues is much less important than prophesying
Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, only edifies the speaker himself, but prophesying builds up the church
Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to others, it builds them up and gives them encouragement and consolation
Even in the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah prophesying is not mainly a matter of prediction, but of speaking for God and of speaking God forth
Throughout the Bible, to prophesy means to speak for God and to speak forth God and, in a secondary way, to predict
To prophesy in the sense of foretelling, of predicting something before it happens, is miraculous and does not require the growth in life
In verse 4 Paul continues, 'He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church'
To prophesy, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord, not only builds up the individual saints, but also builds up the church
He knew they were in turmoil, and he spoke to them with a certain amount of carefulness in order to calm them down
He pointed out to them that he would not profit them unless he spoke to them either in revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching
In verse 8 Paul asks, 'For if indeed the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle'?
In verse 9 Paul says, 'So also you, unless you give by the tongue an intelligible word, how will it be known what is being said?
The Greek word translated barbarian, barbaros, means foreigner, that is, a non-Greek, one who does not speak Greek
In verse 12 Paul declares So also you since you are zealots of spiritual gifts seek that you may abound to the building up of the church
Their problem with spiritual gifts was due to their self-seeking, not caring for the building up of the church
In dealing with the first six problems, in the realm of human life, the apostle stresses Christ as God's unique portion to us
In dealing with the last five problems, in the realm of the divine administration, he emphasizes the church as God's unique goal for us
The apostle's completing ministry is comprised of Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
Our mind should be set on our spirit , never detached from it, even in our daily walk, needless to say in our prayer
The apostle's intention here is to hold the Corinthians back from their excessive practice of speaking in tongues
Paul's word about all speaking in tongues refers to all the functioning ones, not to all the attendants in the meeting
In verse 24 Paul says, 'But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all'
The phrase 'all prophesy' refers to all the functioning ones, not to all the members of the church in the meeting
The water of baptism is a symbol of the fact that we have been baptized into the Triune God and baptized into Christ
In chapter fourteen Paul's concept is not mainly related to organic growth, but to governmental administration
We may use the term 'organic expression' to describe chapter twelve and the term 'governmental administration' to describe chapter fourteen
The building up of the church is for administration, but the building up of the Body is for the expression of Christ organically
If you seek tongue-speaking for the Body and if you take care of the Body, then your tongue-speaking will be helpful to the Body
In case after case it damages the church, tears down God's administration, and overthrows the divine government
Pauls intention was to regulate the Corinthians rescue them from their distractions and bring them back to the central lane of Gods economy
As he says in 2 Corinthians, he delayed coming to them because he wanted to spare them and did not want to come in sorrow
Because they repented and were adjusted after receiving his first Epistle, Paul was happy and went to Corinth to see them
He knew from his experience in Corinth how much the church had been damaged by tongue-speaking and by the so-called miraculous healing
Realizing the damage this had caused to the church in Corinth, Paul was very sober when he wrote the book of Romans
Those who have become addicted to tongue-speaking have no ear to hear the word of the cross and the deeper things concerning Christ
They are like a piece of wood that has been ruined by poor carpentry and cannot be used in making better furniture
The practice of tongue-speaking has still frustrated many of those dear saints in the matter of the growth in life
Now we can understand Paul's concept in 1 Corinthians and know the burden in his spirit and on his heart when he was writing this book
In the Recovery Version of 1 Corinthians, the subtitle for 14:26-40 is, 'How to Function in the Church Meeting'
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting to offer
The psalm should be the praise of God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life
The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ with the church as His Body to others
To exhibit Christ and to enjoy Him in our meetings for the building up of His body must be our unique purpose and goal
He does not say that just a few have, that many have, or that most have; he says that 'each one has' something
He then mentions five things in the following sequence: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation
The fact that Paul mentions a psalm first indicates that in the meeting of the church praising the Lord must be primary
Now we must go on to write more hymns and songs on the completing ministry of Paul and the mending ministry of John
Let us also sing about the seven lampstands, the seven lamps of fire, and the flowing river in the book of Revelation
The writers of the Old Testament did not have a clear revelation concerning the church as the mystery of Christ
Since this matter is no longer hidden, we need to write hymns concerning it based on the revelation in the New Testament
After saying, 'Each one has a psalm,' Paul goes on to mention a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation
They should be centered on Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, not on other things
The singing and speaking among Pentecostal people today falls far short of the vision of God's economy in the New Testament
We thank the Lord that His recovery is in another realm, a spiritual realm, a heavenly realm, the realm of Christ and the church
In these verses we see that Paul did not altogether neglect speaking in tongues, but instead gave some regulations concerning it
Verse 32 clearly indicates that our spirit should be subject to us, not that we should be subject to our spirit
Some in today's Pentecostalism excuse themselves by saying that whatever they do in the meetings is according to the spirit
The expression 'exercise the spirit' is meant for those who are sober-minded, especially for those who tend to sit quietly in the meetings
Verse 34 says, 'Let the women be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but let them be subject, as the law also says'
According to 11:5, women can prophesy with their head covered, and Acts 2:17 and 18 and 21:9 confirm that there were women prophesying
According to the teaching of the entire New Testament, sisters may prophesy, but they do not have the authority to define doctrines
Brother Nee realized that if the sisters did not pray in the meetings, half of the church would be paralyzed and out of function
He does not agree that sisters should speak in the church meetings in a way to exercise authority over the brothers
He charges them to know definitely that his teachings are a commandment of the Lord, and they are authentically authoritative of the Lord
Because speaking in tongues does not afford any profit for such building, the apostle is faithful to expose its lesser value
He also charges us not to forbid to speak in tongues in order to keep the all-inclusiveness and oneness of the church
In the early days of the church life, there were not so many doctrines, practices, or ways to work for the Lord
After they were saved, converted, and regenerated, they became another kind of people, a people indwelt by the all-inclusive Spirit
In addition to calling on the name of the Lord, those in the early church did a great deal of speaking about the Lord Jesus
If we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord daily, then in the church meetings we shall have something of Christ to share with the saints
If we build up this practice, we shall be able to say, 'O Lord Jesus, Your name is the sweetest name on earth'
As we contact the Lord and call on His name, we must walk with Him, live by Him, and do everything according to the index of His eyes
If we are away from Him or if there is something between us and Him, we cannot live according to the index of His eyes
We have been emphasizing the need to have intimate contact with the Lord, even to live according to the index of His eyes
We may bargain with the Lord, asking Him to let us go just this one time and promising Him that we shall not go again
If we do not contact the Lord daily and live by Him, what shall we have of Christ to exhibit in the church meetings?
Surely we cannot show forth our disobedience to the Lord, or testify concerning how we went shopping in spite of the Lord's inward protest
If we enjoy the Lord in our daily life and testify in the meetings of this enjoyment, we shall have even more enjoyment of the Lord
If we are brought back to this simplicity in our meetings, we shall not use the hymnal or even the Bible to replace the all-inclusive Spirit
We have seen that although the Christians in the early church did not have the Bible or a hymnal, they did have the living Christ
Whenever they gathered together, they could exhibit what they had experienced and enjoyed of Christ in their daily living
If we do this, our meetings will become a performance, the meeting hall will become a theater, and the saints will become performers
Our meetings should not be performances-they should be exhibitions of the way we live at home, at school, and at work
It is significant that the New Testament does not charge us to walk according to the Scriptures, but to walk according to the spirit
The more we live by walking according to the mingled spirit, the more we shall be filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God
In the Lord's recovery we must cast off traditional Christianity, especially the traditions related to formal meetings
We shall simply gather together to have a spontaneous exhibition of the riches of Christ for the building up of the church
Because of the influence of tradition and the natural concept, it is very easy for us to meet in a systematized way
The only thing for us to do is to exercise our spirit to have intimate contact with the Lord as a living Person day by day
We need to make a declaration to Satan and to the whole universe: 'I don't know the meaning of holiness or spirituality
Let us all look to the Lord for mercy and say, 'Lord, we have been veiled by religion and distracted from Yourself
The gospel of Christ not only has life; it also has the life power to subdue death, to conquer death, and to annul death
He is the One who was incarnated, who lived on earth as a man, who died on the cross, and who was raised from the dead
The religion of Islam, for example, claims that although Jesus was put on the cross, He did not die there, but was taken away by angels
In order to be God's wisdom and power to us for the solving of our problems in our daily living, Christ must be the resurrected Christ
If we would know the divine administration, we need to realize that a rebellion has taken place in the universe
Imagine, the very One who was called the mighty God and the everlasting Father lived in such a situation for more than thirty years!
It is not altogether accurate to say that Christ was brought to the cross for in John 10 He tells us that He was willing to give up His life
My burden in this message however is not simply to speak these facts it is to consider the spiritual significance and reality of these facts
The significance of Christ's incarnation is that the very God entered into humanity and became one with humanity
On the cross, therefore, Christ terminated the angelic race, the heavens and the earth, the human race, and every item of the old creation
In creation God does not have a way to carry out His administration, for both the angels and mankind rebelled against Him
When He says that all things have been subjected, it is evident that He is excepted Who has subjected all things to Him
The gospel here is the full gospel, including the teachings concerning Christ and the church, as fully disclosed in the book of Romans
We should stand in the full gospel, that is, in the entire New Testament, not just in certain teachings or doctrines
Other items of the full gospel include Christ as the mystery of God, the church as the mystery of Christ, and the New Jerusalem
The earlier apostles and disciples were eyewitnesses of Christ's resurrection , and their preaching stressed their testimony to this
All the disciples and apostles who saw the resurrected Christ not only saw Him objectively, but experienced Him subjectively
Not only was Christ Himself resurrected objectively, but in resurrection He lived in Peter, John, and all the other apostles and disciples
If there were no resurrection, God's New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God's eternal purpose would be nullified
In verse 14 Paul says, 'And if Christ has not been raised, then is our preaching vain; your faith also is vain'
Without the living Christ in resurrection, both the preaching of the gospel and our faith in it would be empty and void, having no reality
You may answer with a question: 'Do you mean saved from hell and from God's judgment, or saved from the power of sin'?
We need to help others realize that we have been saved from sins, but still need to be saved from the power of sin
The law of sin actually denotes the power of sin, just as the law of gravity actually refers to the power of gravity
He appeals to the experience of those who argue against resurrection and then uses their experience to defeat them
Paul then inserts, in a parenthetical way, something concerning the history of resurrection in verses 20 through 28
In verse 20 Paul declares, 'But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep'
In verse 22 Paul does not just say that in Adam all die, but he goes on to declare that in Christ all shall be made alive
In verse 23 Paul continues, 'But each one in his own order: the firstfruit, Christ; after that those who are Christ's at His appearing'
Paul again refers to Christ as the firstfruit, the first One raised from among the dead as the firstfruit of resurrection
The believers in Christ who have died will be resurrected at His coming, which will be at the end of the church age
We see two resurrections: the first at the beginning of the church age, and the second at the consummation of the church age
If there were no resurrection, Christ would still be in the tomb, and it would not be possible for Him to reign
In Matthew 28:18 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
Now under His reign we must disciple the nations, bringing the nations into His kingdom and making them His people
Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ
When sin is done away at the end of the old creation and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire , death will be abolished
It also will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the white throne
When He says that all things have been subjected, it is evident that He is excepted Who has subjected all things to Him'
According to verse 28, eventually the Son Himself will be subjected to Him who has subjected all things to Him so that God may be all in all
On the one hand, to us as God's chosen people, Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit imparting life to us
On the other hand, to the nations, Christ in His resurrection has become the reigning King executing God's administration
His Body must cooperate with Him in His resurrection life and resurrection authority so that the church may be headed up
There will be the new heaven and the new earth, and we shall be in the New Jerusalem enjoying Christ and reigning with Him over the nations
They did this in hope of their resurrection from among the dead at the Lords coming back since in baptism resurrection is strongly signified
Some believers had relatives, neighbors, or friends who also believed in the Lord, but who died without being baptized
The fact that one believer would be baptized on behalf of another believer who had died signifies a strong belief in resurrection
If there is no resurrection and if Christians simply die and are buried, why would someone be baptized on behalf of the dead?
The fact that someone would be baptized for the dead indicates a belief, an expectation, that the dead one would be resurrected
Paul refers to this practice as part of his rebuttal against the heresy which claimed that there was no resurrection
Paul seems to be saying, 'If the dead are not raised, then why are others baptized for them to signify that they will be resurrected'?
The Corinthian believers were the fruit of the apostle's labor, a labor in which he risked his life and was in danger of death
The apostle will be rewarded for his fighting with evil persons and matters for the gospel's sake at the resurrection in the future
If there is no resurrection, we believers shall have no hope in the future and thus become the most miserable of all men
By this word the apostle warns the Corinthian believers not to have any companionship with those heretics who say there is no resurrection
In verse 33 Paul charges the Corinthians not to pay attention to the deceitful and nonsensical heresy that there is no resurrection
If you take in negative thoughts and become a companion to those who oppose the church life that companionship will corrupt your church life
To become sober, righteously, is to awaken to soberness from a drunken stupor; it is to cease, righteously, to be drunken
To be heretical in saying there is no resurrection is to be ignorant of God, not knowing God's power or His economy
Knowing the situation among the Corinthians, Paul warned them not to accept the heresy which denies the resurrection
In verse 37 Paul continues And what you sow you do not sow the body that shall be but a bare grain perhaps of wheat or some of the rest
Continuing this illustration in verse 38 Paul goes on to say But God gives it a body even as He willed and to each of the seeds its own body
Verse 39 says All flesh is not the same flesh but there is one of men and another flesh of cattle and another of birds and another of fishes
He points out that the body is sown in corruption, dishonor, and weakness, but raised in incorruption, glory, and power
In this message we shall continue to consider the definition of resurrection and then go on to see the victory of resurrection
Verse 45 says, 'So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
The resurrection of Lazarus was merely an act of resurrection; it did not produce, bring forth, anything related to life
Christ's resurrection is absolutely a matter related to life, for in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit
To them the resurrection of Christ is nothing more than an objective act, an act which is not related to the members of the Body of Christ
Those who have this understanding of Christ's resurrection also regard His ascension strictly in an objective way
He wrote about it in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, in the chapter entitled, 'The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus'
The highest definition of resurrection is that it is the process by which Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit
In 1964, when we were working on our hymnal, one brother advised us not to publish the hymns on Christ as the Spirit
He said that because most Christians would not accept this teaching, we should not include hymns on this matter in our hymnal
The crucial matter here is not whether the article is definite or indefinite; it is the clear mentioning of the life-giving Spirit
To say that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit is similar to saying, according to John 1:14, that the Word became flesh
Certain ones who oppose us have admitted that the Son is called the Father in Isaiah 9:6, but they would not say this because of tradition
According to human understanding, tradition, and practice, we should follow the one who is first, not the one who is second
Verse 48 says, 'As is the earthy, such also are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly'
In verse 49 Paul declares, 'And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly'
We may take as an illustration of our situation a caterpillar that is in the process of becoming a beautiful butterfly
According to Philippians 3:21, the body of our humiliation will be transfigured into a body of glory and be like Christ's body
Even today, if we live by flesh and blood and not by the spirit, we cannot practice the church life, which is today's kingdom of God
The mystery here refers to the transfiguration, including resurrection, of our corruptible body into an incorruptible one
In verse 53 Paul continues, 'For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality'
In between is the process of the metabolic transformation of our fallen soul by the life-giving Spirit , who is the reality of resurrection
Through Christs salvation in the resurrection life it will be swallowed up into victory to us the beneficiaries of Christs resurrection life
In God's redemption, Christ was made sin for us in order to condemn sin through His death , thus abolishing the sting of death
We must give thanks to God, who gives us such victory over sin and death through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
It must become our daily experience in life by the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who is one with our spirit
Lack of belief in the truth of resurrection disappoints us concerning our future, thus discouraging us in the work of the Lord
Resurrection is not only the power over sin and death; resurrection is a power over mammon and material possessions
From verse 1 we see that Paul gave the same direction to the church in Corinth as he did to the churches of Galatia
The first day of the week is a symbol of the Lord's resurrection; it is the day the Lord resurrected from among the dead
If we use our money in a worldly way, then no matter what we may say about resurrection, we are not truly in God's administration
Throughout the years, we in the Lord's recovery have been hearing His Word and have been built up in the riches of Christ
In such a spiritual book dealing with spiritual and heavenly matters, Paul eventually turns to the very practical matter of finances
It is easy for our talk to be abstract and impractical concerning the headship, discerning the Body, the gifts, and resurrection
For this reason, Paul, in God's wisdom, deals with the matter of giving immediately after the matter of resurrection
We are not those who live and act in the seventh day of the week, for that day is a memorial of the old creation
If we live in resurrection, in the first day of the week, then in the Lord's recovery there will be no problem regarding financial need
Verse 10 says, 'Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; for he is working the work of the Lord, even as I'
In order for Timothy to be with the Corinthians without fear, they would have to be obedient and submissive to Paul's word
Even though Paul realized that certain of the Corinthians preferred Apollos, he still encouraged him to go to Corinth
We have pointed out that although Paul urged Apollos to go to Corinth, it was not Apollos' desire to go at that time
Although both Paul and Apollos lived in the Spirit, they had different feelings about Apollos' going to Corinth
Paul charges the Corinthians not to be shaken by any heresy, especially the heresy that says there is no resurrection
The fact that they refreshed the spirit of the apostle and of all the Corinthians indicates that they lived and behaved in the spirit
To love God makes us those who are blessed of God to share the divine blessings He has ordained and prepared for us beyond our apprehension
The Lord honors his dealings so that the Corinthians accept his rebuke and gain much benefit through their repentance
The last item covered in this section-money and material possessions-is a test to prove how much we are living in resurrection life
We shall have a daily living that declares to the universe that we are those who live a life absolutely in resurrection
Praise the Lord that we have the headship, the Body, the gifts, the resurrection, and the victory over material possessions!
