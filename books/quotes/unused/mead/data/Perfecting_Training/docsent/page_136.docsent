   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE FIGURES WITH THREE ROLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What a history we have!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were created by God, we got fallen, we have been saved, and now we have Christ living in us!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is in us!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And we also have an ugly, negative part, our corrupted body, which is called the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we have another part which is called the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can see clearly that in Romans 8:10 there is a kind of scene with three roles or three figures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is there playing a big role.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The dead body is also playing a role.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our spirit is playing the third role.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The matter of Christ being in you is somewhat simple, but your dead body is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This word implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And even the more that your spirit is life implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you realize how many stories are implied in this clause: the spirit is life ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, all three of these clauses include a lot of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ in you is a story, and your body is dead is a story, and your spirit is life is a story.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TWO PERSONS IN US</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do have these two parts of our being our body and our spirit and each part has a history.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because in each part there is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our fallen, corrupted, and dead body there is a person, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan is in our corrupted body, and Satan is one with our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This one who is one with our flesh has another name, sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 8:3 says that the flesh is the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Greek language such an expression as the flesh of sin is in apposition, just like the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Light is in apposition with God, meaning that the light is God, and God is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The life of Christ is also a phrase in apposition because life is Christ and Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same principle, the flesh of sin is in apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is because flesh is sin, and sin is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Christ became flesh, He became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 1:14 says that He became flesh, and 2 Corinthians 5:21 says that He was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then Romans 8:3 says that He became the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He became the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here the flesh and sin are just one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who is this one thing?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is Satan, the very person whose name is sin in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is such a person in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same principle, another person is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know this person is Christ, the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why 2 Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So we have two persons within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have pointed out in the past that this Christ who is within us in our spirit is not only life to us, but He has to be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should take Him not only as life, but also as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many unbelievers realize that in their flesh there is a person, but none of them would admit that that person is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And I am sorry to say that so many real and genuine Christians also would not admit that Satan is in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some teach very strongly that Satan is not in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In like manner, many Christians are absolutely ignorant of the fact that Christ is in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even some of them do not believe that their spirit is different from their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even such a person as George M ller who was called the king of faith, did not realize that he had a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His realization was that his spirit was just his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In a booklet which is a part of his autobiography he spoke of nourishing his soul before praying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He spoke of reading a few verses from the Bible to nourish his soul so that he could pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How could such a spiritual person consider that his soul and his spirit were the same?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is because the light to the church up to the end of the last century was not yet that high.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was not as high as what we experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to thank the Lord that we are born one century later.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The later we are born the better.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John the Baptist was considered greater than the Old Testament saints because he came later Matt 11:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the New Testament saints, such as John and Peter and Paul, were even higher than John the Baptist because they came later than he.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the same principle, we would have to say that we are better and higher than John and Peter and Paul because we have come later.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even an apprentice electrician today knows more than Thomas Edison did about electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is because they have come later, and they are upon the shoulders of all the electricians.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today we are upon the shoulders of all the Christians through the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The tragedy is this: many Christians do not stand on any shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They just stand on the flat ground upon their own two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But they are so low.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are standing on a high ladder built up with so many shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The light is much, much brighter today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We would not say that we are nourishing our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We would say that we are denying our soul and nourishing our spirit before praying.</S>
