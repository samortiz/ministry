   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE FIVE SENSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The world around us is composed of myriads of objects of various colors and shapes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is also a host of images and objects inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They form a world all their own.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Between this inside world and the outside world, there is a constant communication back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The impulses of the outside world are transmitted to the inside world, and the inside world reacts and projects to the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The intermediate organs that relate to the two worlds are known primarily as the five senses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through these five senses, the impulses of the outside world are transmitted into us to produce certain perceptions, and through the same five faculties, we communicate whatever is inside of us to the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man were deprived of his five senses, it would be extremely difficult for anything of the outside world to come into him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a whole spectrum of colors in the world around us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if a man is blind, he cannot receive these colors into him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He cannot appreciate the beauty in them, for he lacks the ability to substantiate the colors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you tell him that snow is beautiful, he will ask you, "Why is it so beautiful?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you answer that the whiteness is what makes it attractive, he will say, "What is white anyway?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And if you say that white is the opposite of black, he will answer, "I do not know what black is like."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are all kinds of colors in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But they can only come into us through the substantiating ability of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those without sight do not have such an ability.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The world inside them is void of any color.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are some things which require our hearing ability.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We receive those things through our hearing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are deaf, sound has no effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are some things which call for our tasting or smelling faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The function of our five senses is to transfer all the objective items into us to become our subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have these five senses, all of the outside objects will remain outside of us; they will never be able to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There will forever be a barrier between the two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The work that the five senses does is a work of substantiating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TRANSFER IN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me explain this a little further.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I shall again use the example of color.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Blue is a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is there all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when you take a look at it, your eyes begin to transfer the blue into you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what is meant by substantiation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now you can say that you have substantiated the blue into you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You know now that there is such a color called blue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In fact, every one of us is daily substantiating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now I can see Mr. Chang sitting here and Mr. Lee there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a lamp above me and a road in front of me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All these are substantiated by my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Daily I am substantiating millions of objects into me through my substantiating organs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way, we are brought into contact with the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same sense, we say that faith is the substantiating of things hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I cannot find a better translation than this word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>FAITH IN SPIRITUAL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God uses the word "substantiating" to show us what faith means.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible tells us of many things, some of which we have mentioned previously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These things were hitherto unrelated to us; they existed independently outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We call these spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can these spiritual matters be substantiated into us?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here faith comes into action.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let me say a little more about the function of the five senses, after which we will come to the function of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This afternoon a few of us went for a sightseeing tour in Pali-tai.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was indeed a scenic place, and we absorbed the scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. Jan told us that when the plum tree blossoms in a few days, the view will be even more spectacular.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another commented that the snow that was present a few days ago also made quite an impressive sight.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All these lovely scenes can only be transmitted into us through our seeing ability.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To a blind man, all these beauties are nonexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here is a most fragrant flower.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you put your nose close to it, you can detect its aroma, but if you were without a nose or had a cold, you would not have the smelling ability.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You would not know how fragrant the flower is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Fragrance as a substance would be nonexistent to you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here is a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It produces beautiful music.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The player is skillful and expressive.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But none of these melodious tunes come to a deaf person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To him, music is nonexistent because he lacks the hearing ability.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE SUBSTANTIATING FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The reason I have taken all the trouble to explain these things to you is so that you would understand what the Bible means by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As the eye is to seeing, the ear to hearing, and the nose to smelling, so faith is the organ whereby we substantiate everything spiritual into us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Without faith, every spiritual matter is a nonentity to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why the Bible calls faith the substantiation of things hoped for.</S>
