   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE RENEWING OF THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In previous messages we have covered six items of the divine economy and the divine dispensing in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These items include the incarnation of Christ John 1:14 , the resurrection of Christ John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3 , the breathing of the essential Spirit into the believers John 20:22 , the outpouring of the economical Spirit upon the believers Acts 2:17, 33; 10:45; Titus 3:6 , the regeneration of the believers 1 Pet 1:3 , and the subjective sanctification of the saints Rom 6:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of these six items, four are on God's side and two are on the believers' side.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On God's side are Christ's incarnation, Christ's resurrection, the breathing of the essential Spirit into the believers, and the outpouring of the economical Spirit upon the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the believers' side are the regeneration of the believers and the subjective sanctification of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the believers' side, the first step for God's dispensing is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God regenerated us because He wanted us to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way that we could have His life is by God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we called on the name of the Lord, we believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Immediately, our sins were washed away, we were forgiven, and we were justified in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time, God as the Spirit came into us to impart His life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To impart is to dispense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God imparted Himself into us by dispensing Himself into us as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, regeneration is the first experience of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After regeneration, we all need to be sanctified, not objectively but subjectively, in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this dispositional sanctification God dispenses His holy nature as an element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When this element is added into our being, it becomes our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God does not need to work very much on us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He simply puts His nature into our being as the divine element, and this nature works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By God's holy nature being dispensed into us, we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the second step on the believers' side in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The renewing of the believers by the Holy Spirit Titus 3:5b is the third step of the divine economy and the divine dispensing in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ on the believers' side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God created man in a pure way for the purpose of entering into him as His vessel so that man could contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But before God could come into man, Satan came in to damage man with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, man became dirty, and immediately he became old.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man's oldness was not due to his being ancient.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man became old because of the dirtiness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Genesis 4 Cain murdered his brother Abel v. 8 . Today murder and robbery are very common.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not seem strange today because man has been on the earth for several thousand years, and his condition is growing worse and worse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But Cain, being the second generation of mankind, was not old with respect to time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He became old because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All mothers love their babies, but eventually every lovable infant becomes somewhat unlovable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No mother teaches her child to lie, but after some time, every child lies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did not learn to lie; rather, he was born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every child is "dirty" from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, even a newborn baby is old.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be old is to be sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone on this earth is sinful and is therefore old.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, we all need to be regenerated to receive another life in order to have a new beginning.</S>
