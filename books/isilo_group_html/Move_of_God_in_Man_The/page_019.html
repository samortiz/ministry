We are those who take Christ as our person. We all should say, "Christ is my person." Our person is Christ, and Christ lives in us. He lives in our human life. When we take Christ as our person, we can say that "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20a). This means that we are not living but Christ is the One who is living. In this sense, we are Christ, and Christ is living a human life. Thus, we are Christ living a human life. Since Christ is God, we may say that we are God living a human life. Instead of saying, "I am a man living a divine life," we should say, "I am God living a human life."</P><P>We should not be the person in our Christian life. It is not we who are living a divine life, but it is Christ who is living a human life. If we say, "I am living a divine life," we are the person living. Instead, we should say, "I am Christ living a human life." The Christian life is Christ living a human life. It is not an American, a Chinese, or a Japanese living a divine life. The Americans, Chinese, and Japanese all are on the cross. They have been crucified. We do not have many different kinds of people living in the church. We have only one person living&#151;Christ. Christ, the very God, is here living a human life.</P><P>What is the Christian life? The Christian life is God living a human life. What is the church? The church is Christ living a human life. The church cannot come into existence and be built up by the miraculous gifts and miracles according to the Pentecostal movement. The church has only one way of being built up. That way is to have God living a human life. What builds the Christians up is God living a human life.</P><P>You may think that the Christian life is a matter of learning how to imitate Christ and that you need to bear your cross to follow Him. This is a natural thought. You have to be converted to realize that your Christian life is not you living. Your Christian life is God living. It is not you living a divine life but God living a human life. The proper Christians are those who have God in them living a human life. God is moving in them to be a husband, a wife, or the proper children of parents. The Christian life is God living a human life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Move of God in Man &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
