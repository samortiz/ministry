<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Firstborn of All Creation</H2><P>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. This is wonderful! Since Christ became a man and a man is a creature, Christ surely became a creature. As God, He is the Creator. As man, He is one of the creatures. Many Christians today would not dare say that Christ is a creature. Yet, they recognize that Christ became a man. As Christ is a man, He is surely also a creature. He put on the blood, flesh, skin, and bones of man (Heb. 2:14; Luke 24:39). All of these are created things; hence, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lamb of God</H2><P>John 1:29 tells us that Christ is the Lamb of God. Again, as the Lamb Christ must be a creature. If He were not a creature, He would not have had blood to shed for sinners. Christ was offered to God as the Lamb mainly to shed His blood to redeem us from our sins (Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Seed of Woman&#151;<br>the Bruiser of the Old Serpent</H2><P>Christ was the seed of woman and the bruiser of the old serpent. Genesis 3:15 prophesied that the seed of woman would bruise the head of the serpent. This means that such a seed of woman would destroy Satan. Through death, Christ destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14), and Satan, as the ruler of this world, was judged by Christ on the cross (John 12:31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Seed of Abraham&#151;<br>the Blessing to All the Nations</H2><P>As a man, Christ is also the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:16). This seed is the blessing to all the nations (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:14). In becoming a man, Christ became a blessing to all the peoples on this earth. This was prophesied in Genesis 22 and fulfilled in Galatians 3.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Seed of David&#151;<br>the Builder of God's House and God's Kingdom</H2><P>Christ is also the seed of David (Matt. 1:1; Rom. 1:3). As the seed of David, He is the builder of God's house and of God's kingdom. Solomon, the son of David, built the temple and the kingdom of Israel (2 Sam. 7:12-13). Christ is the seed of David to build up the temple, the church, as the house of God and the kingdom of God (Matt. 16:18-19; 1 Tim. 3:15).</P>
