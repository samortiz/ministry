   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE DECREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM S CONSTITUTION 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The teaching and preaching concerning the kingdom of the heavens began with repentance 3:2; 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Repentance means a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the kingdom begins with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From our mind, it proceeds to our spirit 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to repent in our mind and to be poor in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Following this, we must be pure in heart in order to see God 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mind, the spirit, and the heart are the three major aspects of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we put 4:17 together with 5:3-12, we see a number of items related to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first three, as we have seen, are the mind, the spirit, and the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Next we need to have a normal, proper, uplifted emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is seen in the matter of mourning 5:4 , which comes from our adjusted emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also need to be meek, which requires a strong, normal, proper will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The hunger and thirst for righteousness spoken of in 5:6 is a matter of a pure and proper desire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must desire this righteousness for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being merciful to others involves our attitude 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our attitude toward others must be one of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have a proper emotion, will, desire, and attitude, we shall be able to make peace with others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, our whole being our mind, spirit, heart, emotion, will, desire, and attitude needs to be exercised for the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we have all these virtues, we are qualified to be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not have these, you will not be able to withstand persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, those who are qualified by having all these virtues will be not only persecuted for righteousness, but reproached for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the nature of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Each of the nine blessings in 5:3-12 has a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, if you are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you mourn, you will be comforted, and if you are meek, you will inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, comfort and the earth are also rewards.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to verse 12, the reward is great for those who are persecuted and reproached for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is difficult to give a name to this reward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are reproached, persecuted, evil-spoken of, for the sake of Christ, our reward in the heavens is great, so great that it is beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 13:13 and 1 Peter 4:14 both speak of being reproached for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hebrews 13:13 says, Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Peter 4:14 says, If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This matter of reproach is also spoken of in Romans 15:3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a great reward awaiting those who are reproached for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to be the kingdom people with the nature revealed in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we shall be able to bear the reproach for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CONCERNING THE LAW OF</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this message we come to the third section of the King s word on the mountain, 5:17-48, which concerns the law of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The constitution of the heavenly kingdom must certainly cover the matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prior to the time of the Lord Jesus, the children of Israel had the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They also had the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prophecy is always a help to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the people are weak in fulfilling the law, there is the need for the prophets to come in to strengthen them to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the fulfillment of the law needs the strengthening through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in the Old Testament there were the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason the Lord spoke of the law and the prophets in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A. Not to Abolish the Law or the Prophets,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>but to Fulfill Them</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 17 says, Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To fulfill the law here means three things: that Christ has kept the law on the positive side; that through His substitutionary death on the cross Christ has fulfilled the requirement of the law on the negative side; and that Christ complements the old law by His new law in this section, as continually expressed by the word, But I say to you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Concerning the law, there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The commandments of the law are fulfilled and complemented by the Lord s coming, whereas the principle of the law is replaced by the principle of faith according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before Christ came, there was the law with the strengthening through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why then was there still the need for the law of the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reason is that the demands of the old law were not high enough.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The requirements of the old law were not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Take the example of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The old law commanded us not to murder Exo 20:13 , but it did not say a word about anger.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you killed someone, you would be condemned by the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But no matter how angry you were with someone, as long as you did not murder, you would not be condemned by Moses law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here we see the shortage, the incompleteness, of the old law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However the requirement of the law of the kingdom of the heavens is much higher than that of the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to the law of the kingdom of the heavens, we are forbidden to be angry with our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In verses 21 and 22 the Lord said, You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, the law of the kingdom of the heavens is higher than the law of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Another illustration of this is the law concerning adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The old law forbade the committing of adultery, but the new law forbids looking at a woman to lust after her vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, the basic principle of the law of the kingdom of the heavens is that it is higher than the old law.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We do not annul the old law; we complement it to make it higher.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus said that He did not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many Christians do not adequately understand the meaning of the word fulfill in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Through many years of study, observation, and experience, we have come to see that the word fulfill in this verse means three things.</S>
