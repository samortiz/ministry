   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XX.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHORUSES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible we often find a passage written in a way that is different from the immediately surrounding text; the style of such passages in Greek is different from the rest of the surrounding text, and it more closely resembles poetry rather than prose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such passages are usually not long paragraphs, but one or two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For lack of a better term, we call these passages "choruses."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only those who are more knowledgeable in the Greek language can discover these portions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Examples include: 1 Timothy 1:15; 3:15-16; Titus 3:4-8; Romans 10:8-10; 2 Timothy 2:11-13; Ephesians 4:8-9; 5:16; and 1 Thessalonians 4:14-17.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The structure and style of these portions are in the nature of songs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, the whole of Romans 9 11 is written in this style.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we study them, we have to realize that every portion touches one matter or one doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These passages cover everything from salvation to the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the Holy Spirit to write these eight portions in the form of a song means that there must be precious significance to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>XXI.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>PRAYERS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have Abraham's prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah, Moses' prayer for the rebellious children of Israel, David's prayers in the Psalms, Ezra's prayer in chapter nine of his book, Nehemiah's prayer in chapter nine of his book, Daniel's prayer in chapter nine of his book, the prayer the Lord taught the disciples in Matthew 6, His own prayer in John 17, Paul's prayer in Ephesians, etc. If we study these prayers one by one, we will have a good grasp of the whole subject of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will know what words a man should use when he prays to God and what words will receive an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our heart before the Lord is important but so are our words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus told the woman, "Because of this word, go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The demon has gone out of your daughter" Mark 7:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows how important the words we use in our prayer are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our words are improper, our prayers will not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times when we come to God, nothing happens in spite of our incessant pleading.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when just one or two words come out of our mouth, they seem to release all that we want to say, and the prayer is answered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One brother once had an inflammation in his diaphragm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A few saints were worried that it would develop into pneumonia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They prayed much but nothing availed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later one sister prayed only one sentence: "There is no praise in hell and no thanksgiving in the grave."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That did the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That afternoon the brother rose up from his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our answer to prayer is very much related to the words we use.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the words are right, we will see miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to learn to familiarize ourselves with the proper way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>XXII.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>DIFFICULT PASSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are a few basic principles to dealing with difficult passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, we must believe that the Bible itself contains no difficulties whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there is any difficulty, it is with our biased and misaimed understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, in order to solve these difficulties, it is not enough to interpret according to the text alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No portion of the Word can have its own interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we encounter a difficult passage, we have to study it in conjunction with other passages before we can arrive at any conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No difficult passage can be in conflict with the teachings contained in other parts of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When God wrote the Bible, He did not write one portion without regard for the other portions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is any conflict at all, it must be in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Third, although some words can be found only in one place, not in other places, we still have to believe them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not doubt God's Word simply because of our prejudice and reason.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fourth, we have to look for evidence to solve the difficulties, that is, scriptural evidence as well as logical evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's Word is absolutely logical.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He can never say anything that is illogical.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fifth, the difficulty that we are speaking of here is difficulty in interpretation and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there are contradictions in the numbers used in the Scriptures, we should not consider them as difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These may be manuscript errors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Recently, a manuscript was discovered near Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It has many manuscript errors.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the time it was made, the church was under persecution, Bibles were destroyed everywhere, and it was not easy to make copies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Copying errors are unavoidable, but this does not mean that there is a problem with the inspiration itself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is nit-picking for someone to attack the Bible on account of this kind of error.</S>
