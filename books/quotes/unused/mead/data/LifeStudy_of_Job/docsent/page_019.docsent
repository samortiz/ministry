   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Job's experience of God's consuming and stripping in the Old Testament was far behind that of Paul in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's consuming is to exhaust us, and God's stripping is to take away our riches from us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, God stripped Job of his possessions, and then God consumed him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Job's suffering of the plague on his body was a consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Day by day and hour by hour, Job was being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament God's consuming and stripping become pleasant things.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. Paul Not Being Constricted</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>under the Pressures on Every Side</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In his experience of God's consuming and stripping, Paul was not constricted under the pressures on every side and did not perish despite his being cast down 2 Cor 4:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There were pressures on every side, yet Paul was not constricted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every day he was cast down, but he did not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul did not curse the day of his birth, and he did not say that he preferred to die rather than to live.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, after much consideration Paul said that he still preferred to live, not to die, because to him to live was Christ Phil 1:21-25 .</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>for the Sake of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Paul was suffering distresses for the sake of Christ 2 Cor 12:10 , he was well pleased, he was happy, and he was even rejoicing in the Lord for his experiences Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's reaction to his sufferings was very different from Job's. Job did not rejoice but was all the time vexed.</S>
