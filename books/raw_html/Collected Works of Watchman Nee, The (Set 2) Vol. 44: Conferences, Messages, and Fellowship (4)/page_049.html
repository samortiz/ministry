<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE WARFARE OF LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:9; Heb. 2:14; Rom. 8:13, 6; 2 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 15:21-22, 25-26, 54-55; Matt. 25:34, 46b; 7:14</h1><p>The heaven and earth that God first created was committed to the archangel. Later, the archangel fell and became Satan, and God came in to re-create the world. In addition, He created man to rule over the earth. Satan had lost all dominion through his fall, but he was not willing to concede defeat. He tried his best to gain and destroy man in order to overthrow God's plan. From that time forward, a warfare has been waging between man and Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WARFARE BETWEEN SATAN AND MAN</h2><p>The main battle between Satan and man has to do with life. The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in Genesis 2 do not seem to be direct opposites, but after verse 17 speaks of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the next sentence says, "For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." We can say that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the tree of death, because God said that the day man ate of the tree he would surely die. This tree speaks of the fact that Satan has no other motive in man except to bring him death. His goal is for man to die. Unfortunately, Adam was deceived by the serpent and ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As a result death came upon all men. First Corinthians 15:21 says that death came through one man. The one man is Adam. When he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he brought death to humanity, and man became fallen.</p><p>This world is evil not because it is sinful. Sin is just the means; the end result is death. Satan's work is to bring death to the man God created. This is his goal. Today the root of malady in this Satan-corrupted world is death, not sin. When Adam chose the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he introduced not only sin into the world but also death. This refers particularly to spiritual death. Because of this death, sin came upon all men.</p><p>Sin and death are "co-workers" of Satan. A man who spreads death is one who collaborates with Satan. Satan's goal is not only to cause man to sin and fall but also to bring man into the bondage of death. Death is the characteristic of Satan's work. The ultimate goal of his work is to saturate man with death. Today our meeting does not depend on numbers. If we have a bigger number, it does not mean that we have better meetings. The important thing is that we have to overcome death in our meetings. We have to swallow up death and release life. If we see death in the meeting, it means that life is absent. A Christian must realize that there is nothing more evil than death. At the same time, there is nothing better than life. In God's eyes death is the most ugly thing, while life is the most precious thing. What is life? Life is not a doctrine. A person who has life has the experience of life, but it may be very difficult for him to describe what he has experienced. Life is not excitement or good feelings. Life is just Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF CHRIST'S DEATH</h2><p>How can we overcome death? We can never overcome death in ourselves, because Satan has injected death into us. The only One who has overcome death is the Lord Jesus Christ. The goal of the Lord's work on the cross was to put Satan to death. Satan ruled the world through death, but Christ destroyed Satan through death (Heb. 2:14). The Lord's death is a terminating death, while Satan's death is a non-terminating death. Christ's death is complete and thorough. All other deaths are merely deaths, but Christ's death is a termination. Neither the death of Hades, the death of the body, nor the death of the lake of fire can terminate anything. Only Christ's death terminates. His death has terminated Satan and has terminated even "death" itself.</p><p>Second Timothy 1:10 tells us that Christ nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light. Christ's death is different from Adam's death. In Christ death is halted; it is nullified. This is the gospel. Everything can be burned except for one thing&mdash;ashes. When a house burns, the person who set fire to the house cannot burn it down again. Christ's death is not only a redeeming death but also a Satan-destroying death. When Satan was dealt with, death was dealt with as well. Hence, death reigns no longer; it has been swallowed up.</p>
