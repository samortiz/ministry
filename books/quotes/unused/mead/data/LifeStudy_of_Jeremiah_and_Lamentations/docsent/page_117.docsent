   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>concerning Shemaiah</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 30 through 32 record Jeremiah's genuine prophecy concerning Shemaiah.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jehovah Charging Jeremiah</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>to Write to All the Captives in Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jehovah charged Jeremiah to write to all the captives in Babylon, saying that Shemaiah the Nehelamite had prophesied falsely and had made the exiles trust in falsehood vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jehovah Punishing Shemaiah and His Seed</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to verse 32, Jeremiah prophesied that the result of Shemaiah's false prophecy would be that Jehovah would punish him and his seed so that he would not have anyone living among the exiles and would not see the good that Jehovah was about to do to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Shemaiah would be punished by Jehovah in this way because he had spoken rebellion against Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these three chapters we see that false prophets were speaking false prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jeremiah stood against them to prophesy the genuine word from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Between Jeremiah's genuine prophecies and the others' false prophecies there was a constant struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may apply the situation described in these chapters to the situation in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At Jeremiah's time there were only two groups, but today in Christianity there are many groups: Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox churches, the Protestant denominations, the Brethren assemblies, the Pentecostal and charismatic groups, and the independent groups.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of this shameful situation, it is difficult to help new believers to have a proper realization of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The real church is the Body of Christ as an organism of the living Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the Bible we have been born of God by receiving the divine life to become parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these parts of Christ are members of His universal Body, the church, the divine organism of the Triune God to express Him, the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a church is unique and does not have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ as a living person can have only one Body, and this one Body is something of life, not organization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is not something organized; it is an organism produced by Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this organism every member must function.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every member of the Body of Christ must function in life as a minister, an evangelist, a shepherd, and a teacher for the building up of the church.</S>
