<P>We have to change our concept concerning having a preacher with a preaching meeting. We ourselves need to labor directly to bring one or two into the church life yearly. This should be a goal in our labor. We love the church, but we may not have brought one person into the church in the past five years. We must have a definite beginning. We must practice contacting people to bring definite fruit into the church. We also need to practice the church life in group meetings and in larger prophesying meetings. This is really needed. But we need the adequate number as a base for our practice of the church life. The elders need to work two to three hours in the gospel every week to bring one or two remaining fruit into the church within a year. If the elders do this, others will rise up to follow. We should not give any announcement about this or promote it. We have been doing this for years, with little result. Promotion does not work. We need to labor ourselves to build up a living example.</P><P>This is altogether up to our decision. Would we still remain in the natural way, or would we turn to this way, a way full of the need for learning? A working brother's job may occupy him to the uttermost, but he should still endeavor to save some time every week for definite laboring in the gospel. Many of us have been busy working for years with little result. We must change our way.</P><P>We must have a plan for reaching people. We should make a list of all our acquaintances and study their situation. Then we can work on them according to our study. This is the way to gain the proper persons. We should not leave our bearing of fruit to fortune. It is not a matter of fortune but a matter of labor. We all have acquaintances for whom we can pray. We need to consider them and pray for them. We need to study their situation and decide when the best time would be for us to visit them. Farmers do not labor in a loose way. They study the situation of their land, their crops, and the weather, and they labor accordingly so that they can reap a proper harvest. We need to be the same way in our labor to gain people. We must have a plan and a schedule to labor on people two to three hours every week. We need to learn how to gain people.</P>
