   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Controlling Timothy s Movements</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Fellowship of Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 16:10 says, Now if Timothy comes....</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 11 says, But send him forward in peace that he may come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, give Timothy a message that when he comes to you, you need to send him forward, and that he needs to come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For I am awaiting him with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was expecting that Timothy would come with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul was controlling their movements in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was clearly asking Timothy to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, toward younger brothers, the words in the Bible are quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to learn before God that the authority established by God can control the movements of the young brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, among the older ones, there is only entreaty, not commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us look further at the Epistles to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Timothy 1:18 says, This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you might war the good warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows us clearly that in the case of Timothy, Paul gave orders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This charge I commit to you, that you might war the good warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Timothy, Paul gave orders directly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Timothy 3:14-15 says, These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter two Paul spoke of males and females.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter three he spoke of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What was the reason that he especially wrote of these matters to Timothy?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, I am hoping to come to you, but I am afraid I might be delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In case I am delayed, you would not know what to do in the church; therefore, I am writing to you first.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such a case, I am writing to you so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, Paul did not leave ground for Timothy to find a way himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul did not allow Timothy to do things according to his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul wrote to him: When I am present, you can ask me in person; when I am not present, you can read my epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I come, you can ask me; but before I come, you can read my epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me say again, there is the principle of authority, and there is also the principle of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Paul was an elderly brother, he had authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Writing a letter to a younger brother is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because Paul knew before God and Timothy did not know, Paul fellowshipped what he knew with Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Timothy obeyed, he received the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember that obeying does not mean losing your position in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Obeying allows you to obtain what the older brothers have obtained; obeying causes you to gain the revelation that they have gained in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to your way, you may be wrong; according to their way, you will not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, you should receive guidance from them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This kind of word is very common in the Epistles to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not have time to study them in detail; we will read only the portions concerning the outward way of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second Timothy 4:9 says, Be diligent to come to me quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What we see here is neither discussion nor hope, because we know that Paul was martyred not long after he wrote 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Paul s last Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, he says, Be diligent to come to me quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 10 says, For Demas has abandoned me, having loved the present age, and has gone to Thessalonica.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here there was a rebellious one who went out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What about the other two?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Crescens to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps both of these were sent to those places.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 11 says, Luke alone is with me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He only had Luke there with him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Needing to Bring Mark</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 11 continues, Take Mark and bring him with you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the Mark about whom Paul and Barnabas contended.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Remember that in Acts Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them, but Paul disagreed because Mark went away when the work was at a crucial time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the beginning they went together; but when the work was intense, Mark left, Mark got sick, and Mark was not able to work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, Paul did not agree to take Mark with them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them, perhaps because Mark was his relative.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, the two had a sharp contention, and they went their separate ways.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The amazing thing is that later Barnabas did not have the opportunity to work with Paul, but Mark had such an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Remember that Mark later had learned many lessons from Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Gospel of Mark was dictated by Peter and written down by Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Shortly before Paul s death, Paul said, Take Mark and bring him with you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For what reason?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For he is useful to me for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Mark was profitable to Paul for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 12 says, But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This shows us that this was the arrangement of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul asked Timothy to come, he asked Timothy to bring Mark with him, and he also sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse 20 says, Erastus remained in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Paul was the one who knew the condition of the work the best.</S>
