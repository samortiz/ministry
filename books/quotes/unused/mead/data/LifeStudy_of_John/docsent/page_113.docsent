   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Son Being in the Father</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Father Being in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What a mystery this is!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord says that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Father is in the Son, when the Son speaks, the Father, who abides in the Son, does His work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father does His work in the Son s speaking because They are in one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son and the Father Being One</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 10:30 the Lord tells us clearly that He and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again I say, we cannot explain this matter adequately because it is very difficult for our limited mentality to understand how They two could be one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our limited understanding, the Son is the Son, the Father is the Father, and the two are distinctly separate one from the other.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Lord tells us clearly that the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here I strongly say that the Lord never says that He and the Father are two.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to take the mystery of the Trinity according to the Lord s definite and clear word, not according to our suppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son Even Being Called the Father</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaiah 9:6 reveals that the Son is even called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse says, Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A son is given, yet His name is called the everlasting Father, just as a child is born, yet He is called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is He the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must say that He is both, just as He is both the child and the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can the Son be the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I know only that the Bible tells me so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord that the Bible tells us that the Son is called the Father, just as the Bible tells us that the child is called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, according to the clear word of the Bible, the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>None of us should be a Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But at that time even Philip was made clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son Being Able to Be among the Believers,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Unable to Be in Them</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Son was there with the disciples to express the Father, He was able only to be among them, but He was unable to be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since He was the embodiment of the Father in the flesh, He was among the disciples to express the Father and to be seen by them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But while He was in the flesh, He had no way to enter into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So there is the need of the following section of this chapter, verses 16 through 20.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. The Son Realized as the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abiding in the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that the Father was embodied and expressed in the Son among the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we must see that the Son is realized as the Spirit entering into and abiding in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Notice that we do not say in the Spirit but as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to abide in us the Lord had to be transfigured, transformed, from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He came in the flesh to be among us, but He had to be transfigured into the Spirit before He could come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After coming in the flesh to be among us, His next aim was to be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How was the Lord transfigured?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit by His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His going was not His leaving; it was another step of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was coming in another form, in the form of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first step of His coming was in the flesh; the second step of His coming was as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This chapter has the Lord s going and it also has His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His going was by death and resurrection, and His coming was as another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The other Comforter is His other form, His other figure.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By His coming as the Spirit, He enters into us and makes us to live just as He does.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The life He lives is the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After His resurrection He comes to enter into us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So He lives, and we live by Him also.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He lives by the resurrection life, and we live by Him, sharing Him as the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Another Comforter</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In verse 16 the Lord said, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, the Spirit is another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Greek word for Comforter, paracletos, anglicized paraclete, means one alongside who takes care of our case, our affairs, and all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Greek word for Comforter is the same as that for Advocate in 1 John 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens and the Spirit within us as our Paraclete, who takes care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Holy Spirit, the reality of Jesus and the realization of the Lord, is such a One that is alongside of us, ministering to us and taking care of all of our needs.</S>
