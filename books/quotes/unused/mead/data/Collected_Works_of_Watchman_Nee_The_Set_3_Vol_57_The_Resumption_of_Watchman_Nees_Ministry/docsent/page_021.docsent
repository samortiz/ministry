   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Accepting the Laying On of Hands</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Handing Oneself Over</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Accept God's Assigned Authority</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Receiving the laying on of hands means accepting the judgment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It means that we are willing to submit to the authority that God has put upon a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are responsible for handing ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament, when men laid their hands on the heads of the goats, it meant that they were willing to hand the goats over to the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they wanted to keep the goats, they should not lay their hands on the goats, because they were not willing to hand the goats over.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible says that a man has to come to the altar willingly and offer his sacrifices willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God wants man to hand himself over in a voluntary way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Acts of the Apostles records the matter of baptism; it also records the matter of the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The laying on of hands signifies the acceptance of the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today man sees that baptism is a separation of the believers from the worldly system.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But he does not see that the laying on of hands is an acceptance of God's authority that He establishes in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a man refuses authority, confusion results.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man is willing to hand himself over to the serving ones, it will become easy for the serving ones to do their job.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE CO-WORKERS HANDING THEMSELVES OVER</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The principle in the work is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The co-workers in all the places should first hand themselves over and place themselves under the Head and be directed by the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only then can the Lord do something, and only then will the work have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We hope that in these days the Lord will at least give us a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Henceforth, we have to accept the judgment of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All major decisions and directions must be placed in the hands of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do this, we will have life, power, and direction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, there will be rebellion and insubordination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we hand ourselves over, we will surely feel an "amen'' and a sweet sense within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past the situation in Foochow has been one of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The meetings there became a little kingdom by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The saints were closed and would not fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their hearts were not broad enough and did not include all the believers; they did not see the unique Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The manifestation of the Body in the future will be determined by the nature of the testimony of the local churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The local churches are the models of the coming universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is like an architect designing a house: first he builds a model.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although the model is not very big, it represents in nature what will be built.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the universal Body on the one hand and the Body life in the local churches on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE OUTLET OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>HANDING ONESELF OVER TO THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>TO BE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our work we must find an outlet for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not lacking power today, but we are lacking an outlet for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The problem among us is that the co-workers have not properly handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although there is a little power, this power is not great.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A three-dimensional cup can hold a lot of water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But a flat piece of glass or a broken cup cannot hold any water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because our work has been "flat,'' we have lost many blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament both typify the church in the New Testament, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only when this Body becomes a "three-dimensional" Body can it be a vessel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only then can it contain God's riches and be a strong and powerful testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only should the co-workers do this, but the brothers and sisters should also consecrate themselves fully in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No matter where he or she is, every brother and sister should be a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of us need a specific declaration; we should count the cost and hand ourselves over.</S>
