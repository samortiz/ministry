   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST BEING GOD ESSENTIALLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND HAVING THE SPIRIT ECONOMICALLY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heretical teachings about Christ come from having an inadequate understanding of the Bible's description of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One verse that has especially confused people is Matthew 27:46.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the cross, right before His death, the Lord cried out, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>People have wrongly used this verse to say that Christ was not God since God forsook Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They might also point out Matthew 3, where the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus at His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They ask, "If Jesus were God, why did He need the Holy Spirit to come upon Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of question can be properly answered with what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the Lord was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He possessed the divine essence Lesson Fourteen .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You can say that He had the Holy Spirit as His essence, as part of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was essentially God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why then did the Holy Spirit descend upon Him at His baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was necessary in order for the Lord Jesus to carry out His work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His baptism was the beginning of His three and a half year ministry on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During that time He did many wonderful works such as preaching and performing many miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the four Gospels He healed the sick and the crippled; He fed five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fishes; He cast demons out of people and calmed the raging winds and seas; He even raised the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To do all those things He needed the authority and power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We call this aspect of the Spirit "the economical Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Spirit that Jesus received at His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He had the Spirit essentially for life at His birth and He received the Spirit economically for power at His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Jesus was crucified on the cross, the sins of the human race were put on Him; He was made sin on our behalf 1 Pet 2:24; 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The righteous God judged Jesus for man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that moment, God saw all the sins of the world on Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy God had to turn away, and the economical Spirit left Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus Jesus cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we read in 1 Peter 3:18 that, on the cross, Christ was "being put to death in flesh, but made alive in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Jesus died on the cross for sinners, God left Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But, according to this verse, God passed through crucifixion with Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This God-man was put to death in His human flesh, but made alive in His divine spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had the essence of God from birth to death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His essential being never changed; in His essence He was still God and still man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This should help us understand who Christ was on the cross: He was both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should have no doubt that the Lord Jesus was fully and uniquely qualified to die for mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise Him for His wonderful death as the God-man!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of His accomplishment on the cross we are saved and are being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>QUESTIONS Explain the significance of Christ dying as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Discuss the consequences of the heretical teachings which state that Christ is God but not man or man but not God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Explain the meaning of the Lord's last words, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
