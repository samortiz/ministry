	 <h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Preach the Gospel<br />
in Their Homes</h2>
<p>We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel by themselves in their own homes. This requires constant encouragement. The members of the small groups should pick up a burden to encourage each other to preach the gospel by themselves in their homes. Although this preaching may not be flawless, it will have a much better flavor. When we eat at a good restaurant, we may eat the best delicacies, but we do not have much of an intimate and warm feeling. When we eat at home, however, we eat more ordinary food, but we feel quite intimate and warm. When we preach the gospel ourselves, the taste will be unique and enjoyable. In some groups there are brothers and sisters who are not very strong and who do not often come to other meetings. But when it is time to preach the gospel in their home, they will start seeking and preparing. Perhaps the husband will suggest that the family read John 3:16 about how God loves the world. As the time approaches, he may lack confidence in his ability to speak so he may ask his wife to listen to what he is going to speak. After speaking in this way, he may realize that his words need to be supported with some verses, so he will look up some related references. Those who preach the gospel in their homes will not only bring unbelievers to salvation but will also be blessed themselves. Preaching the gospel will not be a heavy burden but an enjoyment. The more we preach, the more we will enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Preaching the Gospel Every Other Week</h2>
<p>We should practice preaching the gospel in our homes every other week. This is only a suggestion. We can fellowship with the saints in our group about the details concerning the gospel preaching times in the homes.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Freely Hearing the Gospel</h2>
<p>Since we can continually preach the gospel in our homes, we will have many opportunities to invite our relatives, friends, and neighbors to come and freely hear the gospel. We need to pay attention to the word <em>freely.</em> In the past we have not been so wise. Throughout the year we may not have spoken much to our relatives, friends, and neighbors, but when the New Year&rsquo;s gospel meeting approached, we tried to invite people, often compelling them to come and hear the gospel. This is not the proper way. The best way is to converse with our relatives and neighbors in our daily life and to establish a basis for friendship by contacting and getting to know them in a normal way. We may, for example, invite them for tea and say nothing to them about the gospel. Then at some time in the future, we can let them know that we are having a meeting in our home to read the Bible with some friends and to speak concerning the Lord Jesus and that they are welcome to come. If we have a relationship with them, it will be much easier to invite them.</p>
<p>Leading people to salvation does not involve things that are miraculous or strange. Rather, it is according to the law of fruit-bearing. As long as we labor according to this law, it will be very easy to bring people to the Lord. Since our gospel contacts are also our relatives, friends, and neighbors, we can invite them to come to more than just one meeting. When we contacted people in the past, we would speak of the meeting and say, &ldquo;Please come to the meeting.&rdquo; This often made people feel awkward, and it was hard for them to accept our invitation. We need to be in touch with people frequently so that it will be easy for them to accept our invitation when we invite them, and if they cannot come, there will always be another meeting. When we contact people, we should invite them to come freely to hear the gospel.</p>
<p>We also should not give them a strict time to arrive. Some may come a little late, and we should let them. Some may need to leave a little early, and we should not compel them to stay to the end. We should let them freely come and freely leave. Nevertheless, they will always receive something when they come. This is the difference between preaching in our homes and preaching in a large gospel meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head3">First Giving a Personal Testimony,<br />
Then Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The best way to preach the gospel in our homes is to first give a personal testimony concerning our salvation and then speak a short word about the gospel. Small group gatherings do not need a renowned preacher or a lengthy sermon. There are no preachers in a small group gathering because there is no need for a preacher; rather, everyone can testify. For example, after inviting two gospel friends to our home, there can be brief introductions. Perhaps the husband may say, &ldquo;Before I believed in the Lord, my whole being was empty and without peace. There was no harmony in my family, and I was on the verge of divorcing my wife, but now my wife is sitting right next to me. Thank the Lord. He has saved our family and our marriage, and He has given us two lovely babies. These are all God&rsquo;s blessings.&rdquo; When people hear such a testimony, they will feel very warm. Then the wife may say something as well, testifying how her husband&rsquo;s disposition changed completely after he believed in the Lord. This kind of testimony does not require any eloquence. If the children are a little older and are clear about their salvation, we can even ask them to give their testimonies. In this way, before the testimonies are finished, our gospel friends will be completely subdued and open to the Lord.</p>
<p>Many brothers and sisters have been saved because of the testimonies they heard in a gospel meeting. While a gospel message may not get into people, the testimonies of the saints always penetrate into people. After giving a testimony, a brief word on the gospel can be given, but it does not have to be a lengthy discourse. We only need to give people a short word concerning the gospel. We should build up the habit of knowing verses that can easily lead people to salvation and even put these verses on the table or mark them in our Bible so that we will be able to use them when the time comes to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>John 3:16 is a very useful verse. After the testimonies, we can ask everyone to read this portion of the Bible together. We may have read this portion many times in the past, but it will be fresh to our gospel friends. Once this word is imparted into them, they will have a sense of the weightiness of the Word. Although testimonies can unveil people, there is still the need for the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Reading the Word causes people to have a deep impression of what we have spoken.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel in our homes, everyone should speak. The members of the household should strengthen the meeting with personal testimonies of their salvation and with some speaking on the gospel. We can also invite people to ask questions. Many of today&rsquo;s young people will not agree with the gospel when they first hear it; they always have some questions. When we speak about one thing, they may ask about another thing. Sometimes they will even &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; with you for some additional time before making a decision. In such circumstances, we need to be patient when we speak to them. In big meetings, there is absolutely no opportunity for this kind of interaction, but in our homes there is an opportunity for them to express themselves. Many times young people have questions and by allowing them the freedom to ask, their problems can be resolved. When we preach the gospel in our homes, we can do many things that cannot be done in big meetings. We can freely give our testimonies, and our gospel friends can freely ask questions. This can be done only in small group gatherings in our homes.</p>
