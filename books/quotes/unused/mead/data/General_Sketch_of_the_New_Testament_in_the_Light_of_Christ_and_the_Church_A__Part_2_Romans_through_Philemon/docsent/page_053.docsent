   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN PHILIPPIANS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:5-8, 15, 17; 3:7-11, 14; 4:12-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ in every kind of circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No other book deals as specifically with the experience of Christ as this one, telling us that Christ must be our experience regardless of our circumstances and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Students of the Scriptures may ask why the book of Philippians is inserted between the two sister books of Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that there is a sovereign meaning to this; I wholly believe in the sovereign arrangement of these books in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Ephesians is concerning the church, and the church is a matter of a life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we intend to have the church life, we need the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can never separate the church life from the experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can never realize the church in a living way if we do not experience Christ in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to experience Christ in all our circumstances; only then can we realize the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is not a matter of mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot realize the church merely by teaching or by studying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, it requires the real experience of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we experience Christ's life, the more we will sense the need for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we live by ourselves apart from Christ, we do not sense the need for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when we come to Christ and begin to experience Him, right away we sense the need for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the experience of Christ as life is basic to the realization of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of this, Philippians, the book on the experience of Christ, immediately follows Ephesians, the book on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the meaning of the sovereign order of these books.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we love Christ and live in Him, by Him, and with Him, and the more we experience Him, the more we sense our deep need for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LIVING CHRIST TO MAGNIFY HIM</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Philippians has four chapters, and each chapter is a section.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter one shows us that Christ is our life and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, this chapter tells us how we live Christ to magnify Him, that is, to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Living by Christ as Our Life and for Christ as Our Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 21 of chapter one says, "For to me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This has the meaning both of living by Christ as our life and of living for Christ as our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While we are on this earth, we live not by ourselves but by Christ as our life, and we live not for ourselves but for Christ as our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we live for ourselves, we cannot say that for us to live is Christ; we would have to say that for us to live is we ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it is true that for us to live is Christ, this means that we are living by Christ and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is our life and Christ is our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 20 says, "According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say that Christ is magnified in us is abstract, but to say that Christ is magnified in our body is more concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether through life or through death, Christ will be magnified in us bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Magnified means expressed, exalted, and honored.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is expressed, exalted, and honored in us bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that we are living here to express Christ, exalt Christ, and honor Christ, and our life, living, and being are to follow Christ as our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The purpose of our living, of our family, of our job, and of everything in our life is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our purpose is to magnify Christ, express Christ, glorify Christ, exalt Christ, and honor Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although it is an easy thing to quote this verse, do we really live for Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is everything of ours on the altar for Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should remember who it is that wrote this word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The apostle Paul put everything on the altar, and he left nothing for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything of his was an offering, either put on the altar or poured out at the base of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While he was in prison, everything had been taken away for Christ; all that was left to him was his breath.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a person was qualified to say, "For to me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may not be qualified to say this, because we may not be one hundred percent for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must be wholly for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While we do business, our business is for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our job, our studying, our teaching, and everything in our life is for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever happens to us, whatever we have, and whatever we do must all be for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we will be in a position to say that for us, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should check ourselves in this light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verses 20 and 21 are the key verses in the first section of this book, showing how the apostle Paul took Christ as his life and as his expression.</S>
