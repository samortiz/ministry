<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE PSALMIST'S CONDEMNATION<br>ON THE SONS OF MEN<br>AND HIS PRAYER FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION</H2><P>In Psalm 58 the psalmist first condemned the sons of men (vv. 1-5) and then he prayed for their destruction (vv. 6-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist's Condemnation<br>on the Sons of Men</H2><P>In his condemnation of the sons of men, David says that in heart they perform injustice and that their hands "weigh out violence on earth" (v. 2). Then, writing very poetically, he goes on to liken them to a cobra, a most poisonous serpent (vv. 4-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalmist's Prayer<br>for the Destruction of the Wicked</H2><P>In his prayer for the destruction of the wicked, David says, "O God, break their teeth in their mouth;/Break off the fangs of the young lions, O Jehovah" (v. 6). He continues by likening the wicked to water that runs off, to a snail that melts and goes away, and to a woman's miscarriage (vv. 7-8). Then he declares, "The righteous man will rejoice when he sees vengeance;/He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked" (v. 10). Surely it is not a virtue to rejoice at seeing vengeance. David concludes this psalm, saying, "Men will say, Indeed there is fruit for the righteous man;/Indeed there is a God who judges on earth" (v. 11). Here "fruit" signifies a good result or some kind of just compensation.</P><P>How do you feel about the standard of spirituality in this psalm? I cannot have a high appreciation for this psalm. There is very little here that is good. Even the prayer and the praise are unpleasant. Nevertheless, some Christians may love such a psalm and follow it blindly, something which I cannot do.</P>
