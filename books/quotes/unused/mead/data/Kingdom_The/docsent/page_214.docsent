   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>UNDER THE RESTRICTION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The children of the kingdom must have a righteousness that surpasses others' righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 6:9 says, "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we desire to inherit the kingdom of God, we must have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>An unrighteous person can never inherit the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then Romans 14:17 says, "For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Righteousness comes first, then peace, then joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 4:24 says that we "have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The new man was created according to God in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Righteousness is always the first aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 19:7-8 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fine linen is the righteousnesses, the righteous deeds, of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have already pointed out that this righteousness will be the garment qualifying the Bride to attend the marriage feast of the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, righteousness is extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Peter 3:13 says, "Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The new heavens and a new earth indicate eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not simply a matter of having a righteousness which surpasses others' righteousness, but of having the righteousness which qualifies us to attend the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, in the new heaven and the new earth the significant aspect will be righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the development and harvest of the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are five other points included in this matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seed of being reconciled as opposed to not killing is developed in Colossians 3:13: "Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against any; as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps the single brothers and sisters and also the husbands and wives need to pray-read this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Ephesians 4:32: "And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as also God in Christ forgave you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the development of the seed of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seed of the purity of the children of the kingdom of the heavens is developed in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4: "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Timothy 5:2 says: "The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul exhorted Timothy to deal with the younger sisters with all purity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is purity not only of the body, but also of the inward parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew 5:34-37, the Lord Jesus said, "Do not swear at all."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This seed is developed in James 5:12: "But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word of the Apostle James is nearly the same as that of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It may be that James still remembered what the Lord Jesus had said on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 4:25 also develops this seed of not swearing: "Wherefore, having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we are members one of another, we should put off the falsehood and speak truth each one with his neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all need to learn to be simple and to answer yes, yes or no, no.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Matthew 5:39 is the seed of not resisting an evil person: "Do not resist the one who is evil."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This seed is developed in Romans 12:14: "Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It continues in 12:17: "Repaying no one evil for evil, taking forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul develops this point further in 1 Corinthians 4:12b-13a: "Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: being defamed, we entreat."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Corinthians 6:7 says, "Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why do ye not rather take wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seed of loving your enemy is sown in Matthew 5:43-46 and developed in Romans 12:20-21: "But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not be conquered by the evil, but conquer the evil with the good."</S>
