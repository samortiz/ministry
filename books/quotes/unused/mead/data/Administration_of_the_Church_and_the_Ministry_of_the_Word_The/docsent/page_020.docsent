   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S HOUSE BEING GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Protestantism has adopted the thought of Catholicism and frequently speaks about going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, we are in heaven; we have been seated with Christ in the heavenlies since the day we were saved because the day we believed into Christ, we entered into God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no scriptural basis for the teachings of Catholicism and Protestantism concerning going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even Paul is not in heaven; he is in Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must understand that it is a matter of person God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not a matter of place heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s entering into man is His coming to the earth; man s entering into God is man s going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason the Lord Jesus said, Where I am going you know the way John 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was actually saying, I am now going to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as I entered into man through My incarnation, I am now going to the Father to enter into Him through My death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The disciples thought the Lord was referring to a place and replied, We do not know where You are going; how can we know the way? v. 5 . Then the Lord Jesus said to them, I am the way...; no one comes to the Father except through Me v. 6 . The way is the Lord Himself, and the destination is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, it is not a matter of place but of believing into the Lord, believing into God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus brought man into God to enter into a union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When man enters into God, he enters into the realm of heaven, that is, the realm where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From this perspective, it is a matter of place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The beginning of chapter 14 speaks of God and God s house; God can never be separated from His house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One must enter into God in order to enter into God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whoever enters into God has entered into God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, no one can enter into God s house apart from being in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One must be in God in order to enter into God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His incarnation the Lord Jesus came from the Father and entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, for Him to go back to the Father, He needed to pass through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through His death and resurrection, the Lord went back to the Father from man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the Lord was going to be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is where He was going.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord s coming was a matter of entering into man, not of coming to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His going was a matter of going to the Father, not of going to heaven v. 28 . The Lord entered into man through His incarnation, and He entered into the Father through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Gospel of John does say that the Lord Jesus ascended into heaven; it says, No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we should not say that the Lord s going to the Father refers to His going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus did not go back to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was with the disciples, and He dwells in us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since He wants to dwell with us, how can He leave us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the Lord s going in chapter 14 does not refer to His going to heaven; it refers to His going to the Father from man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Believe into God, believe also into Me is the subject of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Himself is the way for us to believe into God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord entered into the Father through death and resurrection, and we entered into the Father through the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him v. 7 . The Lord wanted the disciples to know that it is not a matter of position or place but of a person, that is, the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Philip said, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us v. 8 . Jesus answered, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? v. 9 . These words are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These verses do not speak of a place; they speak of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They speak of God, not of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a matter of entering into God, not of going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This chapter is not on the rapture or ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is on the Lord Jesus bringing man into God through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Believe into God, believe also into Me is the subject of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This matter is altogether concerning a person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 10 the Lord said, Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whereas verse 2 says, In My Father s house, verse 10 says, The Father who abides in Me. Where does the Father dwell? Where is the Father s house? Logically speaking, the place where we dwell is our house; our house is the place where we dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many Christians think that the Father s house is heaven, but verse 10 says, The Father who abides in Me. This shows that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the Father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot say that a person lives in Taipei but that his house is in Taichung.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A person lives in his house.</S>
