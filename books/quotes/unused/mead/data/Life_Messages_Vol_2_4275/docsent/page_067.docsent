   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TIME OF THE GRAFTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When did this grafting occur?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was at the time we believed and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 6:3 says, "Or are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were baptized, we were baptized into the Lord Jesus in spirit and were identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The life within Him came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GROWING TOGETHER WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 6:5 goes on to say, "For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words "have grown together with Him" in the Greek imply an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The meaning is quite rich.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It can be likened to a skin graft.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The surgeon may cut a piece of flesh from a patient's leg and attach it to his arm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a few days the skin taken from the leg will grow together with the flesh of the arm; they will be organically joined to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Life growth will occur.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the very kind of union meant in Romans 6:5.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have been grafted to the Lord Jesus and are now supplied by His life and His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A growth is taking place as we are enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This union is not like two dead pieces of wood put together; however closely they may be placed to each other, there is no growing together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There must be a living branch grafted into a living tree for there to be not only a joining but also an organic growing together, with the branch enjoying the riches of the life of the better tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Chinese version translates "grown together with Him" as "identified with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is quite good, but we do need to include the thought of being joined and growing together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both the joining and the growth are essential for a successful graft.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the two pieces of flesh do not grow together after a graft, within a few days the grafted skin will decay.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The joining together must bring the growth; then the two lives become one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE CUTTING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a branch is grafted, both it and the tree must be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just binding them together will not join them organically.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both must be cut and then grafted together at the site of the cut.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the two wounds kiss each other, the graft can take and there will be the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When was the Lord Jesus cut?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The wound of the Lord Jesus is waiting for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His side has been pierced, the blood shed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When is the sinner cut?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He too has been cut on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He experiences this cutting when he repents and receives the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We had a co-worker from the northeast of China who, before his conversion, was arrogantly opposed to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day he went into a temple and noticed an open Bible on the table in front of the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His curiosity was aroused, and he began to read Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Its words quite impressed him, and he decided to take the Bible home and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more he read, the more the light shined.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Convicted of his sins, he wept, beat his breast, and rolled on the floor in repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Was this repentance not a cutting?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was a branch being cut.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then when he called on the Lord to save him, he was grafted to this One who had already been cut.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the site where the wound of the sinner met the wound of the Lord Jesus, they were grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord began to live and grow in this newly grafted branch to supply him.</S>
