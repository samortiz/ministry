[1]  It is so wonderful that God is not only thinking about you, caring for you, paying attention to you, and being merciful to you, He also loves you.
[2]  But God not only is merciful toward you, He not only cares for you and pays attention to you, He also loves you.
[3]  But God gave us this book, the Bible, the Word of God, which tells us that God is love!
[4]  When Jesus was on the earth, everything He did expressed God's love toward men.
[5]  If you read the life of Jesus, you will find out that He is not only a good man but God from heaven becoming a man.
[6]  If you have not believed, let me tell you that God does not hate you; rather He loves you.
