   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here the Lord speaks of Himself as "the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God" Rev 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord is Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Amen means all right; it means "so let it be."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, He will fulfill everything, and nothing will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus testified of the work of God on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the many beings and things created by God, the Lord is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of My mouth" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sardis is living in name, but dead in reality; Laodicea is neither hot nor cold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To Ephesus the Lord said, "I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place" 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To Laodicea He said, "I am about to spew you out of My mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord will not use them again; they are no longer the amen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem is that they are neither cold nor hot.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are filled with knowledge, yet lacking in power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When they were hot, they were Philadelphia; but now they are colder than before.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once Philadelphia falls, she becomes Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the people of Philadelphia can fall to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing" 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have mentioned already that the movement of the brothers is far more significant than the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Reformation was but a reformation in quantity, while the movement of the brothers was a reformation in quality, recovering the original substance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This power is really great.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But because these brothers were stronger than others in conduct and in truth to the point that even a cook among them knew more than a missionary in the Protestant churches, they became proud.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"You are all incompetent; only we are competent," was their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one was competent in the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The famous Scofield went to the brothers to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Gypsy Smith, so widely known, went into their midst to obtain profit, taking their doctrines to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All workers, students, preachers, and believers received help and light from them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not know how many more received help from their books.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many must acknowledge in their hearts that in the entire world, no one can teach the Bible as well as the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result some of them became proud.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Our students are the teachers of others," they say.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although they are greatly opposed, some are self-declared heroes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The most evident result is that some became self-satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some brothers do have brotherly love and seek the good of others, while others have nothing but knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, it was inevitable that they become self-exalted and conceited.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord shows us that a proud Philadelphia is Laodicea, and Laodicea is a fallen Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consequently, in many places the meetings in their midst have trouble with their behavior and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The special feature of Laodicea is spiritual pride.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As far as the historical side is concerned, the Lord has fulfilled this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can meet Philadelphia today, and we can also meet Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both are quite alike in their position as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The difference is that Philadelphia has love while Laodicea has pride.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no difference in outward appearance; the only difference is that Laodicea is a proud Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not wish to relate many things concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I will just give you some illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A brother among them once said, "Is there anything spiritual that cannot be found among us?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A certain brother, after seeing a new magazine, said, "What new thing can it give us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is there anything that we do not have?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He returned the magazine without reading it any further.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Another brother said, "Since the Lord has given us the greatest light, we should be satisfied; if we read what others have written it is a waste of time."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another said, "What do others have that we do not have?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And still another said, "What others have, we have, but what we have, others may not have."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we hear this kind of talk, we should immediately recall what the Lord says regarding those who say, "I am rich."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, how careful we must be that we may not become Laodicea!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On an island in the Atlantic Ocean, there was a hurricane which destroyed many houses, including the homes and meeting halls of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Within a few hours brothers from all over the world sent them more than two hundred thousand pounds sterling, the relief reaching them more swiftly than that of the government.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In their midst there is really brotherly love, but there are also those who have become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Protestant churches are not qualified to become Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sardis herself acknowledges that she has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have been working for more than twenty years, yet I have never met a missionary or pastor in the denominations who claims that they have the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They always say they are inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The failing and weak Protestant churches are Sardis, not Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only Laodicea has the special feature of spiritual pride.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Protestant churches have many sins, but spiritual pride is not their outstanding sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only the fallen brothers would say, "I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only fallen Philadelphia can become Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As to wealth of spirituality, Sardis knows quite well that she has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They often say, "We are not zealous enough; our zealous members have run away."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Richness is the condition of Philadelphia, while boasting of their richness is the distinguishing mark of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only Laodicea can boast.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A person who departs from the position of Philadelphia cannot go back to Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Asking a brother to go back to Sardis is an impossibility; he can only go on to be Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Laodicea also does not continue the line of the orthodoxy of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She goes beyond the line of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They are those who have vain knowledge; they have no life and are self-satisfied, self-exalted, and conceited.</S>
