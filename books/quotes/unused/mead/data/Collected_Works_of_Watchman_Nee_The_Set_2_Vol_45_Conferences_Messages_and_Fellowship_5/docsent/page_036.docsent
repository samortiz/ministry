   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BECOMING OUR REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only has He become our sanctification in our inward constitution, He has become our redemption in our outward body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Lord Jesus was only our Redeemer, He and we would still be separate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Lord that He is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, our redemption is not just a thing, but a person who is joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians tells us that the Lord will appear one day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time all those who believe in Him will receive God's redemption; that is, the dead will be raised and those who are living will be changed 15:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day of redemption we will be manifested as the sons of God and will reign with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>None of this is the result of any doing of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as we were not saved by works, we also should not live according to our works.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our assurance, whether it is related to our salvation, walk, or rapture, is based on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When two Christians died once, I said to some, "When a Christian dies, he is not buried; he is sown."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Corinthians 15:42-44 does not speak of "burying," but of "sowing."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that there is a difference between sowing something and burying something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything that is sown will eventually grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But anything that is buried is buried; it will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians we do not have cemeteries; we only have gardens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What we sow will one day grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is within us, and He is also in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Christ is not bound by death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Death cannot hold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On that day, neither death, nor the grave, nor Hades, nor Satan will stop us from rising, because the resurrected Christ has become our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The end of an unbeliever is burial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His death is an entrance into an eternal grave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although there will be the second resurrection, this resurrection is different from those participating in the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unbelievers will be judged at the second resurrection; they will enter the second death, which is the greater death Rev 20:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A child once asked me, "Does it take much effort for Christians to be raptured?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To the child the rapture requires a great deal of effort.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we see that Christ is our redemption, this kind of question will not arise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Christian is raptured because he has Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Going to the throne is an effortless matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that there are not many things or objects in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not a theory, but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christianity is not a religion of works.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not a matter of works, but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first step in our salvation is regeneration: "You must be born anew" John 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last step is the redemption of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From beginning to end, everything is based on "Christ our life" Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is not here to be outward things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has come into us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people say that love is a thing, that gentleness is a disposition, and that humility is an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we must see that all these things do not depend on what we do, but on our knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we know concerning Christ is what truly matters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible tells us that Christ is the "I AM" John 8:24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His name is the "I AM."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These verses do not tell us what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that He is whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In one circumstance He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In another circumstance He is humility.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This love and humility are not merely love and humility per se, they are a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ becomes our love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ becomes our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some of us have already realized this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters can have such a realization.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Prayer: Lord, besides You, we have no greater reward.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You are the great things, and You are the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By Your mercy and blessing, may these incomplete and imperfect words remove our veils and shine within us so that we can truly know You as the "I AM."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Your name we pray, amen.</S>
