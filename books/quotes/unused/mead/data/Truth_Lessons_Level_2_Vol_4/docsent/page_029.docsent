   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not to Be Grieved by Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit who is within us and who is working for us should not be grieved by us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 4:30 says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To grieve the Holy Spirit is to displease Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once He comes into us, the Holy Spirit abides in us forever John 14:16-17 , and He will never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, He is grieved when we do not walk according to Him Rom 8:4 , that is, when we do not take Christ as reality nor have Christ as grace in the details of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes when we feel unhappy, that feeling of unhappiness is actually the feeling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the contrary, when He feels happy within us, we are happy also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we take Christ as reality and have Christ as grace, we will make the Holy Spirit happy, and He will give us joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we should take care of the Holy Spirit in us and not cause Him to be grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>30.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not to Be Quenched by Us</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit in us should not be quenched by us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Thessalonians 5:19 says, "Do not quench the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit causes our spirit to be burning Rom 12:11 and our gifts to be flaming 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we should not quench Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Christian life is a life inspired and stirred up by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Throughout the day we should have the Spirit inspiring us, stirring us, and moving and acting within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, instead of quenching the Spirit, we need to fan the Spirit in us into flame that He may burn in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>31.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not to Be Insulted by Us</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit within us who gives grace to us should not be insulted by us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 10:29 warns the Hebrew believers not to insult the Spirit of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Under the new covenant, through the redeeming blood of Christ, the Hebrew believers had become partakers of the Holy Spirit 6:4 , the Spirit of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they had returned to Judaism to offer sacrifices for their sins, they would have been contradicting the work of the Spirit of grace; that is, they would have been sinning willfully to insult the Spirit of grace, who dwelled in them and worked in them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church life we should not contradict the work of the Spirit of grace and fall to the extent of insulting the Holy Spirit, thereby suffering serious loss.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of grieving, quenching, or insulting the Spirit, we should experience and enjoy Him positively as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then, through the work of the indwelling Spirit, we will feel happy, released, and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>32.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the Means for Us to Pray</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jude 20 says, "But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit is the means for us to pray, and to pray is to have fellowship with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By prayer we are preserved in our fellowship with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit is the element and sphere of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we pray by this element and in this sphere, we experience and enjoy the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to this verse, if we would build up ourselves upon our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the foundation of this holy faith, and in the sphere of it, by praying in the Holy Spirit, we build up ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit enjoyed through our prayer are necessary for our building up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves upon our most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit; thus, we await and look for the mercy of our Lord that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but also inherit it for eternity v. 21; Matt 19:29 . 33.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Helping Us in Our Weakness</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans 8:26a says, "In like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In particular, weakness here is our weakness in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prayer exposes our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not easy for us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may have the energy to do many other things, but we may not have the energy needed to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if we have the desire to pray, we may not have the energy, strength, and ability to carry out our desire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that we are weak in God's interests and in the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the indwelling Spirit works in us to help us in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this verse, the phrase "in like manner" includes matters covered in foregoing verses such as awaiting, eagerness, groaning, endurance, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While we are groaning, the Holy Spirit also is groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While we are expecting, He is expecting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While we are hoping and enduring, He is hoping and enduring.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whatever we are, He is also the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In like manner the Spirit joins in to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a comfort this is!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are weak, He apparently is weak also, although actually He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He sympathizes with our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He appears to be weak for the sake of our weakness in order to participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He participates in our weakness in order to help us and to join in our manner.</S>
