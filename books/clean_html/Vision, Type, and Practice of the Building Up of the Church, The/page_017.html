<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP AND<br />
THE MANIFESTATION OF FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how the Body of Christ builds itself up in love (Eph. 4:16). Every member in the Body of Christ has a function. Being properly joined with other members is the condition necessary for a member to manifest his function. This means that the function of a member depends on being joined. Any member who is individualistic or detached from other members will not be able to manifest his function. Therefore, the most accurate way to determine whether there is a problem with our function is to measure our function against our being joined to others and built up. If there is a problem with our function, it must be because we have a problem with being joined or with being built up with other members in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>It is possible for a Christian to seemingly be spiritual, full of light, or spend much time in prayer yet not have much function. The primary cause for such situations is a lack of joining and building. Spirituality, enlightenment, and prayer need to be measured against being built up. The properness of a person&rsquo;s spirituality depends on how much he is joined with other saints. If a person seems spiritual but is individualistic and cannot be joined with other believers, his spirituality must be improper. Proper and normal spirituality causes a person to be joined with other saints. Nothing places a stronger demand on our spirituality, on our being dealt with by the Lord, and on our living before Him than being joined together with other saints. We can never have genuine spirituality without being joined and built up together with all the saints.</p>
<p>A saint may have proper conduct, be pious, fear the Lord, and not do anything inappropriate, yet he may be individualistic before the Lord and unable to be joined together with other believers. Such a saint seems to be spiritual, but he has never been broken; his self is still strong. No one can find fault with him because he seems to be perfect. Although he has no conflicts with other saints, he cannot be joined with them. This indicates that he is not broken and that his spirituality is not proper. Because of his eccentric spirituality, he does not bear fruit before the Lord. When such a saint is broken by the Lord, he will be able to be joined with other saints and built up together with them. Then he will no longer be individualistic. He will also bear fruit and manifest his function.</p>
<p>We do not want the saints to be fruitless and barren even if their condition before the Lord is good. Such saints neither bring people to salvation nor help others pursue the Lord. Instead of taking care of younger believers, they care only about their welfare and integrity before God. There also are saints who do not seem to be outstanding, spiritual, or perfect, nor do they seem to have learned many lessons, but they bear much fruit and take care of new believers and of those who seek to serve the Lord. These saints are like begetting and nurturing parents; they have many children and are full of function. If we evaluate these examples before the Lord, we must say that the first category of saints does not have genuine spirituality, but the second category of saints bears much spiritual weight, because they bear fruit, and their functions are manifested.</p>
<p>In John 15:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; If anyone abides in the Lord, he will bear much fruit. Bearing much fruit is the manifestation of the function of a branch. The branches of a vine have only one function, which is to bear fruit. They cannot be used as building material, nor are they suitable for fuel. Therefore, the branches of a vine that do not bear fruit are useless. Only when they bear fruit is their function manifested. The more fruit they bear, the more their function is manifested.</p>
<p>Every believer is a member of the Body of Christ and a branch of the Lord, the vine. As branches, our function is to bear fruit. To bear fruit is to bear clusters of grapes, that is, many saints. The elders, deacons, and responsible ones should all bear a few saints. The saints whom they bear are their fruit. Such fruit is the manifestation of our function in the church.</p>
<p>Regrettably, we do not have the situation of bearing much fruit. The spiritual condition of many serving ones is good, but they do not bear any saints. Such serving ones can be compared to good-looking but fruitless branches. Their function is not manifested practically in the church. This situation is the result of being individualistic, isolated, and not built up with other believers.</p>
