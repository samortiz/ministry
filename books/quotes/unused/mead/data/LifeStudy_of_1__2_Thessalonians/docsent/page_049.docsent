   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HINDERED BY SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 18 Paul says, "Wherefore we wanted to come to you, indeed, I Paul, both once and again, and Satan hindered us."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the apostles were carrying out the will of God, Satan frustrated them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul put the blame on Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In so doing he was telling the Thessalonians to shut out the Judaizers and to hate Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostles were eager to see the believers at Thessalonica, but they were hindered by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>HOPE, JOY, AND CROWN</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verses 19 and 20 Paul concludes, "For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus at His coming?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For you are our glory and joy."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word rendered coming in verse 19 is parousia, a word that means presence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's coming is His presence with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this light these two earlier Epistles were written.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every chapter of the first Epistle ends with the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 20 indicates that since the apostles were the believers' nursing mother and exhorting father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>7, 11 , the believers, as their children, were their glory and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apart from them, the apostles had no hope, glory, or crown of boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here Paul seems to be saying, "You are our hope, our joy, and our crown of boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers, we are here only for you; we are not here for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not have you, we do not have anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are our hope, even as your hope is the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without you, at the Lord's coming back we shall be short of joy and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need you!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are our hope, our joy, our crown, and our glory before the Lord Jesus at His coming."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once again Paul expressed deep emotion in caring for his children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He certainly was a father exhorting his children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As such an exhorting father, it seems as if Paul was saying, "Children, we are here only for you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without you, life is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If it were not for you, we would not want even to live."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a word from parents is deeply touching; it touches the heart of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Would you not be touched deeply if your parents wrote such a word to you?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Would you not be touched if they said that without you life is meaningless, that they are living on earth only for you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No doubt, when you heard or read such a word, your tears would flow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of speaking fosters children and helps them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a good father, Paul knew how to touch the heart of his children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are able to touch the heart of others, you will be successful in fostering their growth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The best way to foster others is to touch their heart deeply.</S>
