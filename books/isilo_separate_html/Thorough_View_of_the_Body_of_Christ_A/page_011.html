Each essence has its own capacities. For instance, a lemon has the constituent and element of lemon, and within that constituent and element is an essence called lemon extract. This lemon extract possesses a capacity to soothe our throats. Another example is the various types of antibiotics with their different constituents and element and thus their different essences. Each essence brings about a different capacity to cure a different disease.<p>The Spirit, who is the essence of the Triune God as well as the consummated Triune God Himself, became not only the element but also the essence of the Body of Christ. Such an essence also possesses its own capacities. First, the essence of the Body of Christ contains the divinity of the Triune God with the capacity to supply the divine life (Phil. 1:19). The Spirit as the essence of the Triune God becoming the essence of the Body of Christ is able to supply God&#8217;s life and nature into us. This is His capacity. Second, the essence of the Body of Christ contains the excelling humanity with the capacity to supply the same excelling humanity to us (2 Cor. 4:16). The humanity of the Lord Jesus is high and excelling. He possesses not only a rich divinity but also a surpassing humanity. We can clearly see this in the Gospels&#8217; record of His feeding the crowd with five loaves and two fishes (Matt. 14:14-21). A great crowd gathered in the wilderness one evening and had nothing to eat. After the Lord received the five loaves and two fishes from the disciples, He ordered the people to sit down in rows. Then He looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the food, and gave it to the people. After the crowd ate and was full, He charged the disciples to gather the leftovers, which eventually filled twelve baskets. Here we can see that while the Lord richly supplied the people in His rich divinity, He did not waste anything but cherished what God had blessed. What a high and excelling humanity this is! When we were saved, the Lord Jesus not only delivered us from sin; He also entered into us to be our life and to supply us with His excelling humanity in order that our own humanity may be transformed and uplifted.<p>Third, the essence of the Body of Christ contains the all-inclusive death of Christ, with the capacity to put to death the negative things (Rom. 8:13b). Just as antibiotics possess germ-killing essences, the all-inclusive death of Christ is able to kill all the negative things in us. The redemption accomplished by Christ through His cross two thousand years ago can now be applied to us through His eternal Spirit. The effectiveness of His death is operative in us because the Spirit of His essence contains the all-inclusive death of Christ, and this Spirit is now in us. When He operates in us, this Spirit contains the capacity to kill all the negative things and will put to death all the negative &#8220;germs&#8221; in us, much like antibiotics.<p>Fourth, the essence of the Body of Christ also contains the surpassing resurrection of Christ with the surpassing capacity of resurrection (Phil. 3:10a). Although we often feel sorrowful and depressed in our Christian life, whenever we look to the Lord and fellowship with Him, there is a kind of inner surpassing power which simply carries us through our situations. Such surpassing power is the resurrection of Christ in us becoming our surpassing essence. The resurrection of Christ raised Him from Hades, and He ascended into the heavens to be far above all. Now this surpassing resurrection in the Spirit, who has become the essence of the Body of Christ, enables us to participate in its capacity in the same Body.<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of the Reality of the Triune God</h2><p>The third major point concerns the reality of the Body of Christ. We have already indicated that reality refers to the real condition of persons and things. The Body of Christ is the church today, and all of its reality is the Spirit of the reality of the consummated Triune God. The reality of the processed Triune God is His consummated Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6). The reality of all that the Triune God is, has, and can do is simply this Spirit of reality. The reality of the death and resurrection which the Triune God passed through is also this Spirit of reality.<p>Furthermore, this Spirit of reality makes everything of the processed Triune God a reality in the Body of Christ (John 16:13-15). It is this same Spirit of reality who makes all the riches of the Triune God, which are just His reality, possible and real in the Body of Christ. All that the processed Triune God is, including righteousness, holiness, life, light, power, grace, and all the divine attributes, are realized by this Spirit of reality to be the real attributes of the Body of Christ (Rom. 15:16b; 14:17; Eph. 3:16). Originally, such righteousness, holiness, life, light, power, and grace were merely God&#8217;s attributes; now these attributes have been realized in the church by the Spirit in the Body of Christ. The church therefore possesses the reality of the divine attributes, such as righteousness, holiness, life, light, power, and grace.<p>Furthermore, all that the Triune God experienced, including incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, are likewise realized by this Spirit of reality to be the real experiences of the Body of Christ. Originally, it was the Triune God who was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected. But when the Spirit of reality came, He made these experiences of the Triune God real in us as our real experiences. Because of this we can live a normal human life on the earth today. We can deal with the negative matters which befall us by the capacity of the death of Christ. We do not lose our temper, nor do we blame or rebuke others, because the death of Christ is realized in us through the Spirit of reality. Moreover, the Spirit with the resurrection of Christ works in us to enable us to love and forgive others. These are all examples of how the experiences of the Triune God Himself have been realized in the church by the Spirit of reality to be the real experiences of the church. This is the Spirit of the reality of the Triune God becoming the reality of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE ESSENCE AND REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING ALTOGETHER MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Finally, we need to see conclusively that both the essence and the reality of the Body of Christ are altogether matters of the Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God. Whether essence or reality, it is all a matter of this Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of the essence as well as the essence to which the reality belongs. Essence emphasizes the inward substance, while reality emphasizes the outward realization. Because the Spirit is the inward substance of the Body of Christ, He is also its outward realization. Both the inward essence and substance and the outward reality and realization are of the Spirit. This Spirit is the secret to all that the Triune God is to the Body of Christ. For instance, the secret to God&#8217;s loving the Body of Christ, sanctifying it, and strengthening it, is with the Spirit of reality. It is the Spirit of reality who makes God&#8217;s love real in the Body of Christ, so that it may be sanctified and strengthened. This Spirit of reality is the processed Triune God Himself as well as the totality of all the attributes of the processed Triune God. If we have this Spirit, we have all the attributes of the processed Triune God, such as love, light, mercy, righteousness, holiness, life, power, and grace. Furthermore, the Spirit is also the effectiveness of all the processes of the processed Triune God. Incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection all have their effectiveness, and their effectiveness is just the Spirit of essence and reality. The effectiveness of both the death and resurrection of Christ is displayed in us who possess this Spirit of essence and reality.<h2 class=head1>OUR WHOLE PERSON BEING TURNED TO AND SET ON THE JOINED SPIRIT AND LIVING ACCORDING TO IT</h2><p>This Spirit now dwells in our regenerated Spirit and is joined to our spirit as one spirit (Rom. 8:9-11a; 1 Cor. 6:17). He is not only in us but also joined with our spirit to become one spirit with us. We must therefore exercise to turn our whole being to this joined spirit and set our mind on it (Rom. 8:6b). Do not place your mind on frivolous matters; set it on the spirit by turning your entire being to this joined spirit. We should also live and walk according to this joined spirit (Rom. 8:4). We must speak, do things, treat others, and deal with matters according to this joined spirit. We should talk to our family members in our home life according to this spirit. When we live in this joined spirit, we will be able to live out the Body of Christ and become His corporate expression (Eph. 1:23).<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee on April 13, 1990, in Taipei, Taiwan.)<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
