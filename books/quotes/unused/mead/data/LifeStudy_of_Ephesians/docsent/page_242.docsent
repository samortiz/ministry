   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 10:12 gives us a clue as to how we may enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse Paul says, The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The riches of Christ should not just be studied they should be enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not enjoy them by meditating upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To meditate is to exercise the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament we are not told to meditate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The use of the word meditate by the King James Version in 1 Timothy 4:15 is not an accurate translation; the Greek word is better rendered attend to.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we desire to experience the riches of Christ, we should call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of us can testify that such calling is much sweeter and more enjoyable than meditating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we taste His sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some criticize our practice of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to them, it is merely a psychological phenomenon with no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If calling on the Lord s name simply produces a temporary psychological experience, then the same experience could be achieved by calling on the name of some other person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, such is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we call on the dear name of the Lord Jesus, we enjoy His reality and taste His sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Remember, the Lord s name is backed up by His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, when we call on the name, we contact the Person, the reality of whom is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The name of the Lord Jesus is often associated with the Spirit in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, 1 Corinthians 6:11 says, But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we call on the name of Jesus, we experience the Person of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because this Person is real, living, near, and available, we experience Him and enjoy Him when we call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a wonderful way to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LIVING IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The book of 2 Corinthians reveals the kind of life lived by the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul lived by taking Christ as his life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was constantly enjoying Christ and experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 2 Corinthians 2:10 he says that he forgave in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul did not forgive in himself, that is, in his own person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he forgave something, he forgave it in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This reveals that Paul lived in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything we do should be done in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that when a brother loves his wife, he should love her in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, when a sister goes shopping, she should shop in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as we do a particular thing in the person of Christ, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is rather difficult to render accurately the Greek word for person in 2 Corinthians 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It may be rendered face or presence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Greek signifies the area of the face around the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This part of a person s face is the index of his feeling and inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By looking at this part of a person s face, we know how he feels about a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Paul said that he forgave in the person of Christ, he was saying that he forgave in the index of the Lord s inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may experience something of this with our husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, someone may invite me to his home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By looking at my wife s eyes, I can tell by the expression through the index of her eyes whether or not she agrees with accepting this invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At other times, my wife may check the expression that I convey through my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what the Apostle Paul was doing in 2 Corinthians 2:10 as he forgave in the index of the Lord s inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not care for himself or for his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He cared only for the Lord s thought and feeling as made known through the index of His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a living the Apostle Paul had!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was a person always living in the presence of the Lord, always looking at the index of His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, whatever he did was the Lord s doing, and whatever he said was the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul was a person who lived by taking Christ as his person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul s old person had been nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was no longer he who lived Christ was the person living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was the reason Paul said he forgave in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many Christians talk about spiritual gifts, but they know nothing about living in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How different are these Christians from the Apostle Paul!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 2 Corinthians 2:10 Paul seemed to be saying, I do not forgive according to my personal feeling or preference.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I forgive according to the index of Christ s inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I know that the Lord wants me to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By looking at the index of His eyes I know what is in His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, I forgive in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the kind of life that builds up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may do some great work, but we may not accomplish anything as far as the building up of the Body is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only those who live in the person of Christ can build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such a living is not a matter of power or behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is altogether a matter of life, of living in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is one way in which Paul experienced the riches of Christ.</S>
