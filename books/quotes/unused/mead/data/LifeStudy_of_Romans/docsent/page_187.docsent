   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE DESIGNATION BY THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we considered seven significant words: designation, resurrection, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are designated sons of God by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The process of resurrection includes sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This glorification will also be our manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these seven items take place by the Spirit and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God designates us and causes us to undergo the process of resurrection by means of His Spirit and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Also, God sanctifies us, transforms us, conforms us, glorifies us, and brings us into the full manifestation of sonship by the Spirit with life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the book of Romans both the Spirit and the divine life are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>HOLINESS, THE DIVINE ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1:4 why does Paul speak of the Spirit of holiness and not of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a distinction between the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Holiness is the divine essence, the substance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the Spirit of holiness is the Spirit of the divine substance, whereas the Holy Spirit is the Person of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As fallen ones, we are constituted with sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But as the Son of God, Christ is constituted with holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Holiness is His very element.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here holiness does not mean sinless perfection or positional separation; it denotes the divine essence, the very substance of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was according to the Spirit of holiness that Christ was designated the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once again we may use the plant life as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a carnation and a lily have just sprouted, they may look very much alike.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But as these plants grow, they are gradually designated according to the life-essence within them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same principle, the Spirit of holiness is the life-essence within the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He was living on earth in the flesh, He had this divine life-essence within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because this life-essence was according to God s being, it was also the essence of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to our understanding, the word holiness refers to being separated, distinct, from all common things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because God s essence is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is separate from all things other than Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The holiness spoken of in verse 4 is the divine essence that was in the Lord Jesus when He lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as a carnation flower is designated according to the life-essence within it, so the Lord Jesus was designated by resurrection through the divine life-essence within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have pointed out that we all need to serve God in the gospel of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To serve God in the gospel is to serve Him not only in the matters of redemption, justification, and forgiveness, but especially in the matter of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the service in the local churches should be the service in the gospel of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to this gospel, sinners in the flesh can be transformed into sons of God in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What glad tidings!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE APPLICATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this message we need to see that designation, resurrection, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation are all realized by the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to understand this, we need to know that God s economy is to dispense Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fact that God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is related to His economy, to His dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God the Father is embodied in God the Son, and God the Son is realized, transmitted, experienced and gained by us in God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit as the third in the Godhead is God being our realization and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that the application of the Triune God to us comes by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, in our experience the Triune God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Electrical current is an illustration of the Spirit as the application of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Apart from the current of electricity, electricity cannot be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In its application, electricity needs to become an electrical current.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The current, however, is not something different from electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The current of electricity is simply electricity in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same principle, the application of the Triune God to us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit is the current of the Triune God for us to apply; He is the Triune God in motion.</S>
