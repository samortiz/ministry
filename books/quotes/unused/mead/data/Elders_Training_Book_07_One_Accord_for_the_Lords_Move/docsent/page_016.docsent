   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostles that all the saints have to follow are not merely the sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There were many sent ones in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition to Paul and Peter there were Philip the evangelist and John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although John went out to visit the saints in Samaria with Peter Acts 8:14 , he surely was not the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, and a number of other apostles were with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But among these apostles, only Paul was the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the factor that decides who the leading one is in a certain period of time that all the believers have to follow?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the Bible there is only one factor the leading one is the one who leads the Lord s people according to the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The teaching of God s New Testament economy is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teaching of the apostles denotes the entire revelation of God s New Testament economy, and this entire revelation of God s New Testament economy is something absolutely missed by most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some believe that orthodox doctrine is only the teachings Jesus Christ gave to the twelve Apostles while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a serious mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If this were the case, more than half of the New Testament would be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, fourteen Epistles were written by Paul, who was not one among the twelve Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 16:12-15 the Lord told the disciples that He had many things to tell them that they could not bear then.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit of truth would come and bring them into the realization of those things, disclosing to them whatever He had received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son Col 2:9 , and all that the Son is and has is received by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the Spirit discloses all that the Triune God is and has to us, the believers John 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the divine transmission of the divine Trinity into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 3 of Hymn 501 in our hymnal is composed according to John 16:15:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All things of the Father are Thine;</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All Thou art in Spirit is mine;</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit makes Thee real to me,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That Thou experienced might be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What the Father has is inherited by the Son, what the Son has is passed on to the Spirit, and this very Spirit enters into our spirit to be our reality that He might become our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter and John were unable to apprehend what the Lord mentioned in John 16:12-15, so the Lord did not tell them these things in details.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These few verses, however, have been developed in Paul s fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 2 Cor 13:14 is an application of the fulfillment of the Lord s word in John 16:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The teaching of God s New Testament economy includes all the teachings the Lord gave us in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who understands Matthew 5 7?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who can tell you the real significance of John 14 16 with the Lord s concluding prayer in John 17?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today people may claim that they are the apostles but do they know these things?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many of the missionaries who went to China only told people that they were sinners and that Jesus loved them so He died for their sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They told people that if they did not believe in Jesus they would die and go to hell, but if they did believe in Him, they would have a happy life and go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is this God s New Testament economy?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a certain person comes to you claiming that he is a sent one, an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may preach the gospel and somewhat know the New Testament, but what kind of New Testament does he know?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he does not know God s New Testament economy, he will render a leading to you which is full of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A person who is ignorant of God s New Testament economy cannot render the proper leading to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For someone to take the lead does not depend upon who he is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It depends upon whether or not he has the full knowledge of the truth concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul could not have rendered the believers the proper leading unless he had had the full knowledge of the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1 Timothy 3:9 Paul even charged the deacons that they needed to hold the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are going to be an apostle, you should be above the deacons in your knowledge of the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether or not you are an apostle as the leader in the Lord s work does not depend upon who you are or upon your being sent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thousands of missionaries have been sent to the mission field, but do you think that all of them were apostles taking the lead in the Lord s work?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Could they render the adequate leading to the believers?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To some extent even Peter was not up to the standard of the full knowledge of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Paul was raised up by the Lord, Peter was somewhat out-of-date.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was the reason that in Peter s second Epistle he admitted that the one who came after him, Paul, knew much more than he did 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peter did not have as full of a realization of John 16:14-15 regarding the transmission of the divine Trinity as Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews in particular contain the marvelous and full revelation of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peter and John never used the term the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In John s Gospel is the vine in chapter fifteen, which is very close to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But John never used the term the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The apostles are those who can give us the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the day of Pentecost the believers continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The teaching of the apostles does not only imply the teachings of Peter and John at the time of Acts 2 because the Lord had more apostles to come.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Colossians 1:25 Paul told us that he had a particular ministry to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I were to stand up to tell you that I was here completing the word of God, I should be condemned to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The word of God has been completed by Paul plus John s Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is at the end of John s Revelation that the Lord Jesus declared that no one could add anything or take away anything from what has been written.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The teaching of the apostles means the teaching of God s New Testament economy which includes what the Lord Jesus taught in the four Gospels, what Paul wrote in his fourteen Epistles, what John wrote as the book of Revelation, and all the other books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How many real and full Christian teachers know the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5 7?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Who knows the significance of the dispensing of the divine Trinity in John 14 17?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Who knows the revelation concerning God s New Testament economy in Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you do not know, I would propose that you study the Life-study Messages covering them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The apostles are the persons who have the adequate knowledge of God s New Testament economy; otherwise, they could never render any adequate, proper leadership to God s chosen followers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One older sister once told some younger ones that although Brother Nee was only two years older than me, I respected Brother Nee and obeyed him just like a son to a father.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If I could be such an obeying person to Brother Watchman Nee, I could be such a person to everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But who are you for me to be a son to you?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>T. Austin-Sparks had one of the top ministries during his time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I respected him to the uttermost and read his books more than fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I told him personally how much help I had received from his book The Release of the Lord on John 12:24 and Luke 12:49-50.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When he came to visit us in Taiwan he was shocked that I had received the help from this book.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although I respected him to such an extent, when he came to visit us in Taiwan the second time, I stood up to him just like Paul stood up to Peter Gal 2:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was undermining the church ground and trying his best to take away our practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I rose up to stand against this because it was not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Again, the point is this the apostle is the one who can render you the adequate, proper leadership according to the full knowledge of the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>At the day of Pentecost Peter was qualified to tell people all the teachings the Lord Jesus gave to them while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Peter was qualified to do this, and his leadership was prevailing for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But after that his leadership began to wane Gal 2:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then Paul was raised up to be the prevailing leader in the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In Paul s Epistles we can see the great mystery concerning Christ and the church Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I do not believe that Peter understood the teaching of God s New Testament economy to the extent that Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Peter never even used the term the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should believe that our God is living 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since our God is living, He should be always moving.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is still moving today.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Where is He moving?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God s moving is always by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Without speaking, He does not move.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must ask ourselves where God s speaking is.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Is it in the Orthodox church, the Catholic church, the Protestant denominations, the state churches, the private churches, or the free groups?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Our God who is living and moving always moves by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have to admit that His present speaking is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>His present speaking is not concerning presbytery, baptism by immersion, tongue-speaking, gifts, healings, or evangelical movements.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>His speaking today is concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I hope we can all be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am forced to be bold to recommend myself so much to you all.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I am forced to be a fool.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The one who can be the leading one in the Lord s move today is the one who knows God s New Testament economy, the one who knows what God s speaking is today.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Peter was surely the apostle as the leader of the Lord s move at the day of Pentecost because he was a person who knew God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He was even the mouth for God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Whoever is the mouth for God s speaking in his time is the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Those to whom God is speaking are the leading apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Whatever they minister will be the proper leading for all the saints to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This definition is fair.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>To be a person who can render the proper and adequate leadership to the believers according to the full knowledge of God s New Testament economy is not a matter of competition.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>No one can compete with anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It all depends upon His mercy and His compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Paul admitted this in Romans 9:16.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God gave Paul his portion in the Body of Christ and no one could compete with him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we believe in the Lord s sovereignty and that He is living, moving, and speaking, we have to honestly, humbly, and faithfully find out where God is speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Whoever has God s speaking concerning the entire teaching of God s New Testament economy are the leading ones in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>These leading ones, though, cannot add anything to the teaching of God s New Testament economy, as revealed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This teaching was altogether completed by the end of the first century through two persons Paul and John.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>God s divine revelation as the word of God has been fully completed to the uttermost through Paul s fourteen Epistles and John s last writing, Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>It was in the book of Revelation that the Lord as the unique, divine Writer declared that no one can add anything or take away anything.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>As a result, the Bible is the completed word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>No one like Joseph Smith can come to tell us that he has received something in addition to the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Today s leading apostles should be the ones who only know the full contents of this divine New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If you are going to be such a one, you must be filled with the full knowledge of the New Testament economy of God, and you also must be limited by the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>You cannot have anything else.</S>
