<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Having Made of a City a Heap<br>and of a Fortified Town a Ruin</H2><P>Jehovah has made of a city of the nations a heap and of a fortified town of the nations a ruin (25:2a). Because of Jehovah's reaction, a palace of strangers becomes no city at all; it will never be rebuilt. Therefore, a strong people will glorify Jehovah; the cities of terrifying nations will fear Him (vv. 2b-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Moab Being Threshed in His Place by Jehovah</H2><P>In 25:10b-12 we see that Moab will be threshed in his place by Jehovah, even as straw is threshed in the water of a dung heap. Moab will spread out his hands in the middle of the water, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. But Jehovah will abase his pride together with the trickery of his hands. The lofty fortification of his walls Jehovah will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, even to the dust.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Jehovah Having Brought Down<br>Those Who Dwell on High, the Lofty City</H2><P>According to 26:5 and 6, Jehovah has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.

Jehovah Punishing Leviathan<br>and Slaying the Dragon</H2><P>Finally, 27:1 reveals that in His reaction to the nations' excessive action on Israel, Jehovah will punish, with His harsh, great, and mighty sword, leviathan, the fleeing serpent and the crooked serpent. He will slay the dragon (or, monster) that is in the sea.</P>
