<b>1</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>When Noah worked upon the ark as God to him decreed,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>So many others watched, yet to his words they gave no heed.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>But Noah heard the voice of God and did His word obey;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>His business was to build the ark; he couldn't waste a day.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:8px; padding-top:8px; ' >
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The ark of testimony built in each locality.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>2</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>The generation at that time was evil and perverse;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The wickedness upon the earth was waxing worse and worse.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>But Noah stood against the age and ne'er the vision lost.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The ark of testimony must be built at any cost.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>3</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>There were at that time many men who said they worshipped God;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>They served Him and they sacrificed and yet 'twas very odd,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The very thing that God desired they mocked and ridiculed.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Their heart was set upon this age and by the devil ruled.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>4</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>One day the ark was finished and eight souls were led aboard.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>God shut the door and then the heavens opened and outpoured.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>It rained, but Noah took no thought for he was safe inside.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>When all the earth was flooded, he above it all did ride.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>5</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>The ark was just God's testimony on the earth that time.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>For God had found a corporate man through whom His light could shine.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>He needed something built through which He'd fully be expressed,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And now it is the local church where God is manifest.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>6</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>Be careful lest this age would lead you from</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>God's heart's desire.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>For Jesus' testimony must set all our hearts afire.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The local churches are the ark, God's testimony true.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>For this we leave the age behind and give our hearts anew.</span><br>
