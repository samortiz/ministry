<P>As far as the nature of the work goes, there is the need to resume the literature work. We still need to publish books and magazines. We hope that there can be the following publications:</P><P>1.The Present Testimony&#151;For the more matured ones. The content will be of a deeper nature. We ask Brother Yu to take responsibility for this paper.</P><P>2.The Christian&#151;For the new believers. We ask Brother Witness Lee to edit this paper.</P><P>3.The Glad Tidings&#151;For the gospel. We ask Brother Stephen Kaung to take more responsibility for this paper.</P><P>4.Newsletters and The Open Door&#151;Dealing with practical problems in the localities. We ask Sister Ruth Lee to be chief editor of these papers.</P><P>There is the need for mass publication of gospel tracts.</P><P>The editing and compilation of the hymnal will be taken care of by Brother Tang, Brother Chow, Brother Lee, and myself.</P><P>The publication and distribution of these papers will be the responsibility of Chang Hsi-nien.</P><P>To all the other brothers and sisters: The money that you have earned in the past, you can keep it for your own use. From now on, all the money that you make, other than what you need for your own expenses, should all be given to the work of the gospel.</P><P>To the sisters who take care of their families: We hope that you will bear a good testimony at home. At the same time, you should serve the Lord properly in the church.</P><P>To the brothers and sisters who are still in school: You should continue to go to school. There is a great possibility that in the future all of you will have to give up everything to preach the gospel. While you are studying, you should prepare yourselves for this. Wherever the church puts you, you should work there. Your future is governed by the gospel.</P><P>Today, we present ourselves once again before the Lord. We hope that Brother Tang and Brother Kaung will come out in the near future. By the near future, we mean the very near future. I hope that my words will not be misunderstood.</P><P>Brother Chen Keh-san will first return to Foochow.</P><P>Brother Hsia came out of Tsingtao. The Communists have arrived in Tsingtao. Your coming out is not a running away, but a move under orders. All the other brothers and sisters are left in the Communist-controlled areas. Many want to leave and do not want to stay.</P><P>Brother Witness has come to Shanghai, but his family is still in Nanking. His children are growing up day by day. Mrs. Lee has ways to take care of them. Without the proper care, in the future they may be difficult to manage.</P><P>Today, God's work requires that all the brothers and sisters give up everything they have. Individually, we should all try to save as much money as possible. The co-workers have given up their all. The publication of the magazines alone will need so many hundreds of millions of dollars. The meeting hall in Foochow, the guest halls, and the place for the long-term training in Kuling all need money. We have purchased quite a lot of land already, but we have not bought everything we need yet.</P><P>The meaning of handing oneself over is that everyone does the same thing and lives the same way. Yesterday, rice cost 5.5 million dollars per sack. I admit that I was very angry at this. In the co-workers' lodging here in Shanghai, even getting food becomes a problem.</P><P>We should never say that money is not needed in the preaching of the gospel. We hope that God will bless us more and will bless the brothers and sisters to have more income. Everyone who has handed himself over has given his heart and body to the gospel. Everyone has his responsibility, and unless all of us give everything we have, we cannot go on.</P>
