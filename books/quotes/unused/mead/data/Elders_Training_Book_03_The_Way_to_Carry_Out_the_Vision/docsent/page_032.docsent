   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN THE SPIRIT AND SPEAKING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also must remember that whenever we speak in the meeting, we should speak in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we are in the New Testament age, but even David in the Old Testament age spoke in the Spirit 2 Sam 23:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>David s speaking in Spirit was not a kind of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the religious thought.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I beg you all to drop this thought of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Inspiration indicates the degradation of God s people from the living God to a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we serve the living God and this God is the Spirit, we should be in the Spirit all the time if we mean business with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even in the Old Testament times the psalmists and those like David all were living in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, whenever they spoke, they spoke in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean that they were indulging in the flesh like King Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was indulging in the flesh, but God used him to demonstrate something and he received some inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was Saul, but this was not David.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we had been working, living, and acting in the Spirit throughout the whole day from morning to evening, when we come to the meeting we will speak in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If, however, we are busy with family things, with money, with our bank account, with business, with jobs, and with interviews, our talk to people will not be in the Spirit at all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible that as one of the elders, I could be such a person, but I cannot be absent from the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have to go there and I have to sit in the front row in order to take care of the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you come in the meeting in this way you are not in the Spirit but in death, and your coming in brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not the Spirit and not of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then you may feel obligated to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you speak something, that kills the meeting or at the very least lowers down the meeting because you are not a person in Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul s speaking concerning dealing with marriage life comprises forty verses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 25 of this long chapter Paul says that he has no commandment of the Lord, but he gives his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 40 he says that what he is speaking is according to his opinion, but he also says, I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here is a man telling people his opinion, yet he is still in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever such a person opens his mouth, the Spirit comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This enlivens the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same word out of one person s mouth may be a kind of enlightening and life-giving, but out of another person s mouth that word may be a kind of killing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This all depends on whether we live in the Spirit or whether we live in something else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not live in the Spirit yet we expect to have a living meeting, that will be just an opera or a drama.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That will be just like something in the theater, a performance with you as a performer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At least a number of times our meetings were just like a drama with no living reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when you go back to your locality, you must call a meeting, not of all the saints, but at least of all the serving ones who have a heart for the Lord s recovery, to have some fellowship with them to consider and to reconsider the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not mean that we have to have a radical change, but we must have a kind of advancing change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be contented with our present meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not mean that our meetings are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Comparatively speaking they are quite good, but we are not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BEARING THE ARK</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders and all the serving ones must come together to pray and to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every one of these serving ones must be charged, including the elders, to bear the ark of the testimony on their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This group of faithful ones may be between ten and twenty-five saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before every meeting, these dear saints should be living in the Spirit and should get themselves fully ready to bear the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The meeting is the ark, the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need some faithful ones like the Levites to bear the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The most devastating thing to me is to come into a meeting with no one bearing the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You also must realize that the ark cannot be carried on by one person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is the need for coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To bear the ark needs a team.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I came to the meetings a few times with the sensation that no one there was bearing the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There were just performers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church decided to have a Wednesday meeting and all the elders and serving ones are obligated to come.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then they come without a burden and without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They come to pray-read the Word and then to speak something.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is really devastating when no one bears the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This kills the appetite for the saints to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>HAVING A TIME WITH THE SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you elders go back, you must have a time with the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the elders make themselves a special, particular group, they are sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They should not be a drop of oil in a bucket of water, but only drops of water.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In some churches, however, I noticed that the elders are a drop of oil and could never be blended together with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are a special rank, a special class.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You must kill that class and annul that rank.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a shame among us that there is a class and that there is a rank.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you keep this special class, you should not expect that your meeting will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You must be water.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What I mean by being just water is that you are not anything in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You are just a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church is not yours and the meeting is not yours.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church belongs to the saints and the meetings are the saints meetings, so you must be one with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some of the saints are still young, yet a good number have grown up and they are serving and bearing some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is better to have a time together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Get with them to reconsider how to take care of the church and the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you do this, I believe you will see something positive.</S>
