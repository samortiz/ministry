   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WAITING FOR LEADING IN GOD'S ARRANGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord that His work is done apart from the power of man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord has graciously taken care of me since school was disbanded, and I have been transferred to the general affairs department of a factory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May the Lord cause me to walk in His will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An important town in Taiwan Taichung is about fifty minutes by car from my home.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Three brothers have already begun to have a prayer meeting there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The participants are a student from the agricultural college, a special reporter from the Central News Agency, and a worker from the Third Airplane Factory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of these three, the college brother already subscribes to all four publications put out by the Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>None of them want to attend worship services in the denominational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, the head of the reporters' union, the chief of the Public Security Department, and many other local leaders have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They want to attend meetings with brothers from the mainland provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We now have a small number of brothers praying in one accord in Taichung.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have begun small but will grow bigger.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May God accomplish His own work and give us the proper guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It will take time to ripen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brothers are now together watching and praying earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It takes one day to get to Taipei, and we have to travel during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is difficult to do this, and it harms our health and work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since the Lord has now given us a small number of brothers as a foundation, we believe He will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most importantly, we ask the brothers and sisters in Shanghai to pray for us, as Moses prayed for Joshua during the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have written a letter asking the brothers and sisters in Taipei to pray for us also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have begun meeting in the home of a brother in Taichung.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people want to rent the local Kuomintang Party hall.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A small number of brothers feel that we do not need to be so ostentatious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They feel we should have a solid foundation before spreading out, lest we bring on unnecessary misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We want to pursue peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this point in my writing, I feel like thanking the Lord in tears for arranging for my time in Taichung.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The person who introduced me to this place has already left, but I am still in Taichung county.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the Lord's grace, we are in a battle against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the Lord give us sharp weapons to fight the good spiritual fight!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sincerely,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Kao Xuan-zhen</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A meeting place should not be established in the Provincial Political Party Office.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The things of Caesar and the things of Christ should be separate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If local officials want to participate, they must be clean in their conduct, pure in their faith, and at the same time, they must have the desire to walk with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can receive them as brothers, but we can never receive them as government officials.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If anyone retains his official status in a church, that church must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Witness</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>October 20, 1948</S>
