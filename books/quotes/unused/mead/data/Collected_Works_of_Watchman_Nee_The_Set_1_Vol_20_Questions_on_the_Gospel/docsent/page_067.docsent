   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If judgment is to begin from the house of God 1 Pet 4:17 , this judgment must be most severe.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If so, who can pass this judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How we hope that God will have mercy upon us before the judgment seat, for even there, there is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is what Matthew 18 speaks about.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While it is true that God is absolutely righteous in His judgment, He is also forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, His forgiveness is based upon our forgiving others today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose five people offend you, and you forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose another ten people offend you, and you forgive them again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose you forgive everyone who has offended you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On that day, God will treat you justly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since you have forgiven others, it is very just for God to forgive you at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>James 2:13 says, "For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you show mercy toward others, God will have mercy on you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you show no mercy toward others, God will have no mercy on you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are daily forbearing, do not try to find fault, and are generous with others, God will also forgive you on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Daily we need to pay attention to these things: 1 examine our own behavior so that we will not fall under God's judging hand, and 2 have mercy toward and forgive others who may owe us much, so that we may obtain God's forgiveness in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 7:1 and 2 say, "Do not judge, that you be not judged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word "judgment" in this verse indicates that God will judge us in the same way that we judge others; this means that we will be judged by God on that day in the same manner that we judge our brothers today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, if we observe wrongdoing in a certain person and, rather than beseeching him in love, criticize him presumptuously and judge him severely, God will similarly judge us on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way God will judge us on the day of judgment depends on how we treat others today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the meaning of the opening verses of Romans 2: "Therefore you are without excuse, O every man who judges, for in what you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And do you consider this, O man, who judge those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke 6:38 puts it even more clearly: "Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you in return."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we give to others, God will give to us abundantly and richly repay us with a measure not only full to the brim but also running over.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The amount of grace you give to others is the same amount of grace God will give to you in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you treat others severely today, you should not expect God to treat you generously in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, every Christian should learn not to be a "judge" and should avoid judging others with self-righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not forgive others, we will receive the most severe punishment in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are destined to have eternal life because salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if we do not forgive others who offend us in this life, God will not forgive us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can a nation be destroyed?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can a house fall?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is it not because it is divided against itself?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, God will not allow two people in His kingdom to be divided against each other, nor will He permit hatred in the hearts of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God will not allow a ruler of five cities to be in conflict with the ruler of another five cities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He cannot use anyone who is not a peacemaker to rule a city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He can only hand them over to the tormentor until they have paid all their debts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How do they make payment?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They must be willing to pardon and forgive others from their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sooner or later we must forgive others; so why wait until that day?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matthew 6:14 and 15 say, "For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Matthew 5 through 7 speaks of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whoever does not forgive others shall not be forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This forgiveness will affect his position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether or not he forgives will affect his being forgiven in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today our God is testing us to see whether or not we are worthy to be kings in His kingdom and whether or not we are fit to govern in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not think that serving in the church is a great thing; in the future, the things of the kingdom will be much greater.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the coming kingdom, God will give us higher and more glorious things to rule over.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we cannot manage small things today, we will not be able to handle great things in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we cannot deal with things pertaining to this present life, how can we be qualified to judge angels in the future 1 Cor 6:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the sake of that day, let us learn how to forgive others today.</S>
