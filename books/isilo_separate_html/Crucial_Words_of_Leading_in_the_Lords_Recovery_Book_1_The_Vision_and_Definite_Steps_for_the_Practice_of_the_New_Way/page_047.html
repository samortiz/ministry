<p>In the summer of 1933 one seeker of the Lord came to me in the evening at about seven or eight o&rsquo;clock. Because it was hot and my home was close to the sea, we went for a walk by the beach. After we arrived at the beach, we sat down, and he began to ask me about the truth concerning baptism. At that time I was already enlightened by the Lord concerning this truth. I gave a long discourse about the qualifications for baptism, the place for baptism, the person to administer baptism, and other matters, all of which were very scriptural. I remember how confident I was in my speaking and how I quoted all the verses. By the time I finished, it was past ten o&rsquo;clock. The person said to me, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, if what you said is true, you need to baptize me today.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I dare not do this, because I am not an elder. I am not even a junior deacon. I cannot baptize you.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;You just told me that whoever does the preaching can do the baptizing. Why are you saying that you cannot do it now? Did you not also say that as long as there is water, one can be baptized? Before us is the sea, and the water in Chefoo is calm and clean. Let me be baptized now.&rdquo; I was forced to go along, and on that day I baptized him.</p>
<p>Later, in taking care of the churches, I decided that baptism should be approved by the elders and interviews should be conducted by them. The baptizers should either be the elders or brothers serving in the capacity of the elders. I was the one who made all these arrangements. I thank and praise the Lord that during the past one and a half years, even these bonds have been broken. We can now baptize people everywhere. Whoever preaches can baptize as well. This is a wonderful thing. It proves that we have been released from the bondage of religion and are on the way toward true scriptural practices.</p>
<p>Yet I am concerned that the old ones among us will feel that their children and grandchildren are now turning things upside down. The Chinese are especially concerned about &ldquo;family rule&rdquo; and &ldquo;family tradition.&rdquo; This is true not only with you but with me also. Some of my daughters are already grandmothers, and some of my sons are grandfathers, yet I still consider them children and do not have full confidence in them. Sometimes I rebuke myself, saying, &ldquo;Foolish man, the Lord should take you away. Otherwise, you will damage your children.&rdquo; We know that capable parents many times do not produce useful children. A mother who is a good cook often ends up with a daughter who cannot cook. The reason for this is that the mother cannot tolerate the daughter&rsquo;s ineptness and tries to do everything herself. If the mother can hold herself back, even when the food is burnt or spoiled, and if she can encourage the child and not replace her, the child will eventually become a good cook.</p>
<p>Today we are not for the Eastern way or the Western way. We are for the scriptural way. The young people are easy to be trained and easy to be molded. We need to lead them and encourage them in wisdom. Brother Nee once said that after thirty years of age a man&rsquo;s character becomes set, and it becomes difficult for him to change. Hence, we must do our best to be trained in our character before the age of thirty. My point is that the elderly saints should be at ease. They should not think that once things are in the hands of the young ones, they will be ruined. Do not think that once things pass into their hands, the church will be finished. My dear, faithful, elderly brothers, be at peace. Simply encourage and do not replace. Once we do this, the young saints will receive the perfecting.</p>
<p>Some have asked, &ldquo;If the members of a small group include saints from other halls, how should we reckon their attendance? Whom should they belong to?&rdquo; Actually, numbers are not that important. The important thing is to have the real increase. As long as the small group meetings are bringing people to salvation and as long as there is the increase and the spread, why worry about the method of reckoning the attendance? If a person has many babies, he will not have enough time even to take care of their feeding. Where, then, will he find the time to do the statistics? At the present time I have twenty-two children and grandchildren. I can still count them, but I wish I could lose count of them. To lose count of them means that I am fruitful and multiplying. If a church or a meeting hall can report its number clearly, it proves that the number is small. If a church or a meeting hall has so many saints that no one can count them, this means it is growing; we worship the Lord for this.</p>
<p>Dear saints, we must be clear that the grace of the Lord is with His recovery. Christianity is going downward; it does not please the Lord. For the past one and a half years it seems as if I have been constantly rebuking. It may appear that I have never said anything good and have never praised anything. I have been continually pointing out our shortcomings and mistakes. It seems as if I have been constantly shaking my head, criticizing, and picking on everyone. Actually, I would like us to know that the Lord&rsquo;s grace is rich. He truly loves His recovery. As long as we are willing to work for Him, He is ready to pour out His best for us. The number of regular attendants in the church in Taipei may be under ten thousand, but if we include those who do not meet regularly, we have over ten thousand saints. As long as we are willing to practice the God-ordained way, I believe that God will add to our number daily. One day the number in the church in Taipei will be more than we can count. May we all have faith to realize how abundant the Lord&rsquo;s blessing can be.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Controlling Factors in the Church</h2>
<p>From now on, if anyone prophesies in the meeting improperly or poorly, we should not stop him. We should only pray to the Lord and look to Him to somehow make up the lack. We are not a worldly society, and we are not an army. We should not think that once we give up our controlling hand, everything will be out of order. In the church we have no right to control anything. There are, however, a few precious things that control us. First, we have the Lord&rsquo;s life. All the brothers and sisters have the Lord&rsquo;s life within them, and this life controls them. Second, we have the Lord&rsquo;s word. His word gives light, and it enlightens. Third, we have the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit. We believe that the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit is in every brother and sister. Fourth, we have the Lord Himself. We believe even more that the Lord whom we have believed into is in every brother and sister. Fifth, we have the Lord&rsquo;s love. We believe that the Lord&rsquo;s love is in every brother and sister. Even if a believer has not been meeting with us for a long time and is deeply fallen, within him he still has a love for the Lord and the church. These five things are all within the brothers and sisters. This is the reason that we should never control. We should only allow these five matters to function within the brothers and sisters. If we exercise control, these five matters will not have an opportunity to operate. We must look to the Lord. We need to pray for everyone and allow these five matters to operate and become effectual in the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>We should have a testimony that we are neither a worldly society nor an army. We do not need any human control. We are the church. We have the Lord&rsquo;s life, the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit, the Lord Himself, and the Lord&rsquo;s love. All the brothers and sisters have these five things within them. Even the weakest believer, and in particular those who are newly baptized, have these five things within them. If we exercise control, we will frustrate the Lord, but if we do not control, we will actually help the Lord. We will provide the Lord an opportunity to work within people. In any meeting we should not control, even if the saints are exercising their flesh. On the contrary, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, this is Your business. I will not control.&rdquo; Perhaps we may think that this is too extreme, but I am not afraid of being too extreme. I am afraid only of depriving the Lord the opportunity to work within the saints. It is possible that at first we will have some confusion, but eventually the Lord will step in to do His work because this is His recovery.</p>
<p>For this reason, I am bold to say that even if the brothers and sisters turn the meetings upside down, we should still thank and praise the Lord. His Spirit is among us, and His life is also among us. All we need to do is to pray. We can pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You. Your life is in us, and Your word is among us. You are the Lord! Even if the heaven falls, the earth shakes, and the waves billow, You are still on the throne on high. You alone have the authority to control everything!&rdquo; Only pray this way; do not try to restrict or control. Today we should all take our hands off. Do try not to control. The co-workers in particular should not try to control the churches. Do not be concerned that the church will become deformed or distorted. Do not try to preserve anything. We must all be impressed with one thing: Do not control!</p>
<p>This being the case, what should the co-workers, the elders, and the full-time serving ones do? On the negative side, we should not control, but on the positive side, we should focus on stirring others up. We should stir up the saints house by house. In the last message we said something about delivering the meetings to people&rsquo;s homes. Now I say again that we must do the work of stirring up the saints house by house. Some saints have not been meeting for a long time. The co-workers and the elders must take the lead to stir them up in their homes. This is what we ought to do. I hope that we can understand what I am saying. Only by &ldquo;burning all our bridges&rdquo; can we go forward single-mindedly. Only by being &ldquo;backed up against the wall&rdquo; will we be forced to risk everything.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
