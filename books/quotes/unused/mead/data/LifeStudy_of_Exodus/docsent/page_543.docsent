   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THE WORKERS OF THE TABERNACLE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FURNITURE, AND THE PRIESTLY GARMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 31:1-11; 35:10-19, 30 36:2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall begin to consider the workers of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the priestly garments, as described in 31:1-11; 35:10-19, 30-36:2.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I appreciate these portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After studying them, I realize that not even in the New Testament do we have such a detailed picture showing us how to build up God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today God s dwelling place is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The building up of the church is truly a great matter and a very important subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Over a long period of time, I have often spoken with the leading brothers in Anaheim concerning the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a heavy burden on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we are not able to say much with clarity regarding how to build up the church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though I have studied the book of Exodus a number of times, I did not have a clear understanding from this book about the way to build the dwelling place of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, I appreciate the record in Exodus that speaks of the workers of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the unique record in the entire Bible showing us the detailed way for God s people to build up His dwelling place on earth in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we should treasure this record.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The record of the building up of God s dwelling place in Exodus is in three sections: the first, 31:1-11; the second, 35:10-19; and the third, 35:30 36:2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this message and in the message following, we shall cover a number of points from these sections related to the workers of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE MASTER BUILDER</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Exodus 31:2-5 speaks of the master builder of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul uses the term master builder in 1 Corinthians 3:10: According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation....</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A master builder is a leader in God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Bezalel, the Son of Uri, the Son of Hur</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Exodus 31:2 says, See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bezalel is a type in the Old Testament of the master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The name Bezalel means in the shadow of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that as a master builder, Bezalel was altogether under God s shadowing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was a man under the shadow of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This corresponds to Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 3:10, where he says that it was by God s grace that he was made a wise master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All of us, whether we are leaders in God s building or common builders, need God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be under the shadow of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not under the shadow of God s grace, many things may come to disturb us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the shadow of God will keep these things away from us and cause us to remain in a peaceful situation and condition to do the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regarding the building up of God s dwelling place, there is a real conflict, a severe fighting between God and His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The enemy does not like to see the building of God s dwelling place going on in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, he will do everything he can to interrupt, interfere, frustrate, attack, and destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The leading brothers in the churches know that it is a troublesome matter to take care of a local church because the enemy often causes disturbances and frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Certain things we know have been sent by the enemy purposely to damage the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no logical reason for such things to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, they happen because they were caused by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Especially the elders must realize that in order to build up a local church we need to be under the shadow of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For the building of God s dwelling place, we all should be named Bezalel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all should be those under the shadow of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The name of Bezalel s father was Uri, which means light of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This name indicates that all the builders of God s dwelling place should be not only under God s shadow, but also full of the Lord s light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The name of Bezalel s grandfather was Hur.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hur means free, noble, white.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only should we be under God s shadow and full of light, but we should be free and noble.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who build God s dwelling place are not low people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, they are noble people doing a noble work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No other work is as noble as the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the builders of God s dwelling place are white, that is, they are clean and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we put together the meaning of the names Bezalel, Uri, and Hur, we can see what kind of person the builders of God s dwelling place, especially the elders, must be.</S>
