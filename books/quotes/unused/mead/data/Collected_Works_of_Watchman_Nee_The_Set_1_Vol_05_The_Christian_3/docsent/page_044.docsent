   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut" Rev 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the first promise of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the reward for their faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many say that if they do not accept the name of the world, the denominations, and the sects, they will have no place to work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, men will purposely close their doors to them!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to fleshly eyes, this is surely a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Lord considers His name to be precious above everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who will not deny the Lord's name because of the world or the denominations will be given by the Lord an opened door which no one can shut.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How fitting this is!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How comforting this sounds!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who uphold the denominations can do their best to shut the doors, but the Lord opens the doors, and when He opens, no one can shut them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way the Lord is leading us to take is not a way of "uselessness."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The door here, according to the scriptural application, refers to our testimony and opportunity for work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostle Paul mentioned this three times 1 Cor 16:9; 2 Cor 2:12; Col 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All those who walk with Christ will see that on the one hand, they will be rejected, but on the other hand, men will know their Lord in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These two things are not contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The history of the gospel everywhere proves this to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, what is needed is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Judging by results is often wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we need the success of a work to prove the propriety of it, we are walking by doubt and not living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because man's feelings tend to doubt about his own future, the Lord assures one's correctness by His word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One only needs to ask if he has the characteristics of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he has, he can be at rest, for the door is already opened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our eyes are not set on the opened door but on our Leader and the way we take.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If success becomes the measurement of our work, we will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The greatest success can only be determined in the future, not the present.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The standard is eternity and not the temporal age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If believers take success as the standard, they may not be able to hear the Lord's voice here.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The temptation of success may be the biggest trap the enemy has set for the servants of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times, success determines the direction of a person's work more than the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This may continue until the direction actually becomes contrary to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even the success that comes through true obedience may result in excessive boasting, overthrowing one's spiritual serenity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But opposition causes believers to learn patience!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From this, we can see that it is God's good will that He gives to His servants little success!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How wonderful it would be if we did not see the door opened by the Lord, but saw only the Lord who opens doors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a place is in turmoil and storms are breaking out everywhere so that the gospel cannot be preached, it is the Lord's business.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the places in which we desire to see the gospel preached are closed, we have to realize that it is the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we look to Him, we will not be discouraged or grow weary.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we see the Lord opening up a door before us, we can ignore the outward circumstances and can continue to work with boldness and assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if this is not the case, even if we have the protection of the government or the goodwill of the people, we probably will not be able to advance too much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, we have to wait for the Lord to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At first the Lord forbade Paul to preach in Asia, but three years later, we see Paul assembled a church there, and the whole of Asia heard the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should trust in the Lord with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Patience is indispensable in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our faith must be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times, the Lord allows adverse circumstances to come upon us so that we will know that apart from Him we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is only when we realize our weakness that the Lord gives us the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First He gives us the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then He gives the strength to confirm the faith that He gave.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Which no one can shut."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How comforting this is!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The door that Christ opens, no one can shut, not even the world, the devil, or the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although we have no strength even to pry open the door, the door is opened for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The whole church is weak, but a small faith will accomplish what great powers are not able to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ has all power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everything is in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The "doorkeeper" will only open the door to Him John 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once the Lord Jesus unveils Himself, nothing can shut up His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the powers of the world, the Pharisees, the scribes, the priests, the elders, the rulers, Pilate, and Herod cannot stop one sheep of Christ from hearing His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was the case then; it is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whom do we fear will shut the door?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord's word says that no one can shut it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How similar is the condition of Philadelphia to the condition when Christ was on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everyone was scheming to shut the door and to oppose Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Like Philadelphia, Christ dwelt in a system which was once established by God but had since become a total failure.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the time of Christ, the ark of the covenant was gone, and the Urim, the Thummin, and the Shekinah glory of the temple were also gone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All that had expressed God's power and testimony were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God did not have a throne in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the contrary, it was a Gentile power that was reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Israelites were chastised by God through their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In spite of this, Haggai told us that the Spirit of the Lord was still among them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That is why we still see Anna and Simeon and the many in Jerusalem who looked to the redemption of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These were the remnant of the day, the faithful little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the Lord Jesus came, the world rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Still, do we see all the doors closed?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>No. On the contrary, the doorkeeper opened the door to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Who was ever rejected like Christ was?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Who has ever faced more severe opposition than Christ did, who in spite of this, strove on humbly and faithfully?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christ was willing to relinquish everything in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was willing to be considered the dust of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yet not one lost sheep of the house of Israel missed the voice of his Good Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>His eyes were able to search out everyone, whether one was a publican, a sinner, a harlot, a Nicodemus, or a Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is now putting those who have a little power in the place of His former humility.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The doorkeeper will have to open the door to them, in the same way that they have to open to Him.</S>
