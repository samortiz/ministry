   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE LIVING THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY TODAY Scripture Reading: Prov 4:18; 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 8:4; Col 1:29; 2 Cor 5:10 THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL ACCOMPLISHING GOD'S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous messages we have seen clearly that God's desire in the New Testament is that every saved one be a priest of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we need to go and preach the gospel to gain sinners that they may be regenerated so that we may offer them to God as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After this, we need to pick up the burden to go to their homes regularly to nourish and cherish them that they may receive the life supply and grow in the spiritual life until they can present themselves to God as living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we need to continue to carry out in them the work of teaching and perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This requires us to bring them to the small group meetings to have contact and fellowship with the saints that they may open themselves up to the saints to receive mutual care and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In such a small group meeting, everyone has the equal opportunity and right to open his mouth to speak, to ask questions, and to answer questions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone also can teach others and be taught by others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The questions asked are mainly of two categories: one category concerns the divine truths in the Bible, while the other category concerns our Christian pursuit and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is best to have such a small group meeting once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For fifty-two weeks in a year, all should come together weekly to fellowship, minister, ask questions, answer questions, teach, and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, we can gradually enter into the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, we will be perfected to do the same work that the gifted ones do, with all of us carrying out our respective functions for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the stage of perfecting, we need to help others to exercise and learn to speak for the Lord, that is, to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not to gossip or speak ordinary words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, this is to speak concerning Christ and to minister Christ, to speak forth God's eternal purpose, plan, and economy, and to speak forth the proper spiritual living and the spiritual experiences which we who belong to the Lord should have.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to prophesy according to the biblical revelation in coordination with our own experience of life and in conjunction with the instant inspiration that we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, this kind of prophesying is organic and in the Spirit, not mechanical or according to doctrines and reasonings in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such organic prophesying and spiritual speaking spontaneously minister Christ to others and release the light of truth that people may receive enlightenment and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not limited to two or three people, but all attendants have the equal opportunity and the same right to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, prophesying is everyone speaking and everyone listening; it is mutual speaking and mutual listening.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In such a meeting for prophesying, at least over half of the attendants can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that the others may not speak, but because of time not everyone may have the opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If someone does not have the opportunity on one occasion, he can wait for the next occasion to speak, if time allows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There may be some whose speaking is not rich or strong, but there will always be some who speak in a very rich and strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the speakings are needed, whether they are deep or shallow, high or low, rich or poor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because a church meeting is not like a class in school.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a class all the students have the same status and are at the same level, but in a church meeting there are young ones, middle-aged ones, older ones, more advanced ones, and less advanced ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All are blended together, and even the newly saved ones are encouraged to open their mouth to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone presents what he has received of the Lord; in this there are true riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, everyone can receive much supply and edification from what is spoken, heard, taught, and learned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, week after week, the supply that we receive will be of a great variety, and the functions in which we are perfected will be extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When all the saints are established, the whole church can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way, the Body of Christ will be built up organically, and God's desire will be realized, God's purpose will be accomplished, and God's eternal economy will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church should help the brothers and sisters in the way of visiting people to preach the gospel to save sinners, nourishing and taking care of the new believers, and teaching and perfecting them so that all can prophesy and speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the church does this, sinners will be saved, believers will grow, saints will be perfected, and all will prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the church will be flourishing and the testimony will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a rejoicing this will be to us!</S>
