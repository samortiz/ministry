   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Translators have a difficult time deciding whether or not to use a capital letter for the word for Spirit in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason is that the Spirit in this chapter is the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, to walk according to the spirit in chapter eight is to walk according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day by day we should cleave to the mingled spirit and do everything according to this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we walk according to the flesh we are sinners, no matter whether we regard ourselves as good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we need not walk according to the flesh, for we have the option of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we do this, we enjoy all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We daily need to practice having our being according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to apply this in our talking, in our thinking, and in everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, suppose a young one is wondering whether he can participate in a certain kind of athletic activity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My advice to him would be that if he can participate in that athletic activity according to the spirit, then he should go ahead and do so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As Christians, we should not decide matters according to right or wrong; rather, we should decide them according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit who is mingled with our spirit and according to whom we may have our very being is the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a Spirit, the realization and application of the Triune God, is now mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Romans 8 it is no longer a matter of simply the divine Spirit nor of just the human spirit, but it is a matter of the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hallelujah for this marvelous mingling!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But although we have such a wonderful mingled spirit within us, we may not care for this spirit very much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I believe that in the Lord s recovery the Lord will recover the matter of walking according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without this, it is impossible to have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not live and walk according to the spirit, we cannot be a help to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not know how to help others have their being according to the spirit, the church will not be built up, no matter how much we may preach, teach, or minister.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What counts is not teaching, but our living according to the mingled spirit and our helping others to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here in the mingled spirit we enjoy the riches of Christ, and here we have the church as the genuine expression of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more we walk according to the spirit, the more the church will be built up in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:4 and 5 give us the key to the experience of Christ and the church life: walking according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All that Christ is and all that He has done is in this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our spirit has been regenerated, and now it is indwelt by the wonderful life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, it is mingled with this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not be occupied with your weaknesses or infirmities, but pay attention to the marvelous heritage you have the all-inclusive Spirit indwelling your regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we are living in the dispensation of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ointment has been compounded by the divine perfumer, and we now have the anointing of the ointment within us, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every regenerated person has had his spirit indwelt by and mingled with the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All we need today is to exercise our spirit to switch on the heavenly electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is by switching on, not by teachings, that we touch the Lord as the life-giving Spirit and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is by using the switch that we walk according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE WAY TO BE DESIGNATED SONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have pointed out that even the Lord Jesus according to the flesh had to be designated the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before His designation, according to the flesh He was just the seed of David; in that part of His being He was not yet the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But by resurrection He was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same principle, according to the flesh we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But now that we have been regenerated, we can have our being according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we walk according to the mingled spirit, the more we undergo the process of designation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Day by day, we are resurrected, sanctified, transformed, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way to be designated sons of God is not to acquire more teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is to have our being according to the mingled spirit.</S>
