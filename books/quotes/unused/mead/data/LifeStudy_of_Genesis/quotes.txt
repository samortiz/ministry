[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE GENESIS THE GENERAL SKETCH
[2]  Praise the Lord for the life, the divine life, the eternal life, which is contained in this Book!
[3]  And praise the Lord that He has afforded us this opportunity to have a life-study of His divine Word with such a large congregation!
[4]  The Lord Jesus said that the words He speaks are spirit and life John 6:63 .
[5]  Can we imagine that the Bible as the Word of God is the Spirit?
[6]  It is not simply words in black and white; it is something higher, deeper, fuller, and richer that is the Spirit and life.
[7]  And the Bible tells us that the Spirit is God Himself John 4:24 , and that life is Christ John 14:6 .
[8]  I do not say that the Bible is God Himself, but, according to the Lord Jesus, the word in the Bible is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God Himself, the Lord who is life to us.
[9]  When we come to contact the Word, if we are right in our position and open in our heart and spirit, we will surely contact God Himself and receive life.
[10]  In addition, we have some verses which tell us that the Bible has many other functions.
[11]  The Bible has the wisdom which can help us to be saved 2 Tim 3:15 .
[12]  With every book of the Bible, there is a general sketch.
[13]  Christ is the hope and salvation of fallen man, and God will make fallen man to fulfill His purpose through Christ.
[14]  Once we have a real and thorough understanding of the book of Genesis, we can see that it presents Christ as the hope and salvation of fallen man.
[15]  Although we do not find the term the Son of God or the name Christ in Genesis 1 and 2, we learn from Romans 5:14 that Adam was a pre-figure of Christ.
[16]  The basis of creation is God's will and plan Eph 1:10 .
[17]  God has a will, and according to that will He conceived His plan.
[18]  Now we come to the first verse of the first chapter: "In the beginning..."
[19]  In the Bible this phrase, "in the beginning," is used in two ways, the first time in Genesis 1:1 and the second time in John 1:1.
[20]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWO SATAN'S REBELLION AND CORRUPTION 2.
[21]  Satan was an angel created by God before He created the earth.
[22]  The book of Job 38:4-7 tells us that when God laid the measure of the foundation of the earth, the sons of God the angels shouted for joy.
[23]  This proves that God created the angels before He created the earth.
[24]  By reading the full revelation of the Bible, we can realize that God did appoint Satan the head of that universe, and that God had delivered all created things in the heaven and on the earth into his hand.
[25]  Ezekiel 28:15 says that Satan was perfect in his ways from the day he was created.
[26]  Satan initiated the rebellion against God with the evil intention to overthrow God's authority Ezek.
[27]  Immediately after Satan's rebellion, God declared His judgment on him.
[28]  c The Rebellious Angels and the Demons Were Judged
[29]  When God judged Satan and the universe that was under him, God also must have judged the angels which followed him and the living beings on the earth during that age which joined him in his rebellion.
[30]  After being judged, the rebellious angels became the "wicked spirits" in the air Eph 6:12, KJV margin , and the living beings became disembodied spirits, the demons lodging in the water with which they were judged.
[31]  Though Satan, the rebellious angels, and the demons were all judged by God, they are still moving and working today, because the judgment upon them has not yet been executed.
[32]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THREE GOD'S RESTORATION AND FURTHER CREATION 1 PROCESS
[33]  As we have seen already, God's creation is fully covered in chapter 1, verse 1.
[34]  Genesis 1:2b does not refer to God's original creation that was completed with verse 1 but God's restoration.
[35]  God was going to restore what had been damaged, and was going to have some further creation.
[36]  Man was a being created by God, not a being restored by God.
[37]  God's original creation was damaged by Satan's rebellion and then judged by God Himself.
[38]  After God's judgment, there remained nothing except darkness upon the surface of the deep water.
[39]  In the midst of this death condition, the Bible suddenly says, "And the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters."
[40]  When the Bible first says something about the Spirit, it doesn't say "the power of the Spirit," "the might of the Spirit," but it says that the "Spirit of God was brooding over the surface of the waters."
[41]  4 The Separation of Light from Darkness 1:4-5
[42]  After you were saved awhile and had gone on with the Lord, gradually there was a separation within you and you had the discernment to say, "This is light and that is darkness.
[43]  We proceed to the fifth requirement for generating life: separating the waters of death by making an expanse.
[44]  After the second day, we have the third day the day of resurrection.
[45]  In the last message we covered six points, including three comings and three separations.
[46]  As a result of this, there were three separations: light was separated from darkness; the waters above were separated from the waters below; and the dry land was separated from the death waters.
[47]  The lowest life, a life without consciousness, came into existence Gen 1:11-13; cf.
[48]  On the fourth day, there was no growth of life, but the appearance of the stronger, more solid lights Gen 1:14-17 .
[49]  Although light came in on the first day, it was not that solid, not that strong.
[50]  The lights God made on the fourth day were established "to rule over the day and over the night" by their shining Gen 1:18a .
[51]  The light not only shines, but also rules by its shining.
[52]  After the fish, the birds, the fowl in the air, were created on the fifth day Gen 1:20-23 .
[53]  This is the higher life with the lower consciousness.
[54]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIVE THE FOURTH-DAY LIGHTS A PARENTHESIS
[55]  Before we study the creation of man, we need to consider, as a parenthesis, the matter of the fourth-day lights.
[56]  In Genesis 1, it is recorded that on the first day of restoration God summoned the light.
[57]  The sun indicates Christ and also the saints who will shine as the sun in the kingdom.
[58]  Malachi 4:2 says that Christ is the sun of righteousness.
[59]  Although Christ is the real sun, He does not appear as the sun during this age of night.
[60]  All of the days, signs, seasons, and years are shadows.
[61]  Christ is the holy day, Christ is the new moon, Christ is the sabbath day, Christ is the beginning of the year, Christ is everything.
[62]  In this message we will consider the creation of the human life, the higher life with the highest consciousness.
[63]  Since the last message was a parenthesis, we now continue our study with the process of God's restoration and further creation.
[64]  After God created all the foregoing items of life, God still needed to create man as the highest created life to express Himself in His image and after His likeness.
[65]  Man as the center was generated, the higher life with the highest consciousness.
[66]  This is the maturity of life that has the image of God and is able to exercise dominion for God.
[67]  We now come to the central points of God's restoration and further creation.
[68]  God needed to recover the earth for generating life and for dominion Gen 1:9, 26, 28 .
[69]  Although the things created by God are numerous, in the record of Genesis 1 and 2 God only mentioned the matters of life and the items related to life, for His restoration and further creation were focused on life.
[70]  Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."
[71]  Here we find two things the image and the likeness.
[72]  4 Christ Was Made in the Likeness of Man
[73]  One day, Christ came to be made in the likeness of man Phil 2:6-8 .
[74]  Man was made according to Christ's image, and Christ was made in the likeness of man.
[75]  6 Our Body Will Be Transfigured into the Likeness
[76]  This Christ is now within us doing the work of transformation, not only transforming us into His image, but also conforming us unto His very form.
[77]  You have heard that all the truths in the Bible were sown in Genesis, especially in chapter 1.
[78]  As we have seen, Genesis 1 says something about the light and this light has been developed through the whole Bible.
[79]  We have seen the light on the first day, the lights on the fourth day, and the development of these lights to the end of the Bible where, in the last two chapters, it says, "night shall be no more."
[80]  Eventually, God Himself is the light to His redeemed ones.
[81]  We have seen that man is the center of God's creation and that the human life is the highest created life.
[82]  We should never forget the nine items of life mentioned in Genesis chapter one: the grass, the herbs, the trees, the fish, the birds, the cattle, the beasts, the creeping things, and man.
[83]  According to the record of Genesis 1, when God reached the point of creating man, He held a conference.
[84]  This matter of dominion includes a sphere or a realm.
[85]  God's dominion not only has a sphere; it also has an intention.
[86]  In the last message, we pointed out that only four living creatures, representing all creation, are present before the throne of God the eagle, the ox, the lion, and the man.
[87]  The second aspect of God's intention in giving man dominion is to recover the earth Gen 1:26-28 .
[88]  Man is to have dominion over the earth, to subdue it, and to conquer it.
[89]  The third aspect of God's intention in giving man dominion is to bring in God's authority, to exercise God's authority over the earth.
[90]  God will never be satisfied to have His kingdom only in the heavens.
[91]  The Gates of Hades Cannot Prevail against the Church
[92]  The fulfillment of God's intention in giving man dominion involves Christ as the Head and the church, including all the saints, as the Body.
[93]  This does not mean that before Abraham there was no man who expressed God.
[94]  The more you look at God, the more you will look like God.
[95]  To build an altar for the purpose of contacting God means to become more and more transformed into the image of God.
[96]  If you read Genesis 18, you will see that God did not come to Abraham as the Creator or the Almighty God.
[97]  Israel was a people called to be a kingdom of priests Exo 19:6 .
[98]  The principle is the same in the case of Joshua and Caleb.
[99]  One day, the mother of Zebedee's children came with her two sons to Jesus to pray Matt 20:20-23 .
[100]  She prayed a good prayer, asking that her two sons sit on the Lord's two sides in the kingdom.
[101]  p The Case of the Overcoming Saints in the Millennium
[102]  During the millennium, the coming kingdom age of a thousand years, the overcoming saints will be priests and kings Rev 20:4, 6 .
[103]  They will be priests expressing God and kings representing God.
[104]  Let us turn to the book of Matthew and read the last verse of chapter sixteen and the first two verses of chapter seventeen.
[105]  The Lord Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
[106]  And after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart.
[107]  We continue with the subject of the ultimate consummation.
[108]  As we have seen in the previous message, the first item of this consummation was God expressed and represented.
[109]  God is rich and God is rich in blessing, but before the creation of man there was no object to receive His blessing in full.
[110]  3 Man and All Other Living Creatures Were Satisfied
[111]  It is not a small thing to say that man was satisfied Gen 1:29 .
[112]  Suppose Adam had been created and there was nothing for him to eat.
[113]  Suppose God had said to Adam, "I made you, but I didn't prepare anything for you to eat.
[114]  Whatever is mentioned in Genesis 1 and 2 is a seed.
[115]  We have seen in previous messages that light, image, and dominion are all seeds.
[116]  With the church as the Body, God is expressed and Satan is dealt with Eph 1:23; 3:19b; 6:11-13 .
[117]  Whenever and wherever God is expressed and His enemy dealt with, there is the foretaste of rest.
[118]  This is also true in our home life, marriage life, and personal life.
[119]  If you buy something that will not help you to express God and to deal with Satan, you will lose the foretaste of rest.
[120]  If you express God and deal with His enemy in whatever you do and wherever you go, you will have a sweet foretaste of the coming rest.
[121]  The consummation of rest is the rest in the new heaven and the new earth.
[122]  All the redeemed ones as one Body will express the glory of God for eternity Rev 21:11, 23 .
[123]  Everyone will have rest because God Himself will be satisfied and God Himself will find His rest there.
[124]  The Pharisees forced every man to be for the sabbath.
[125]  The Lord condemned them, telling them that they were absolutely wrong.
[126]  In the previous messages we have covered the first main point of the book of Genesis the desire and purpose of God.
[127]  God's desire and purpose are to have a corporate man to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His authority.
[128]  a. Life Conforms the Believers to the Image of God
[129]  The Bible says that it is life which conforms the believers to the image of the Son of God Rom 8:2, 6, 29 .
[130]  Only by the way of life can we be conformed to the image of the Son of God.
[131]  Colossians 3:4 tells us that Christ our life will bring us into God's glory that we may express God.
[132]  Firstly, we need to see the background of God's first step in fulfilling His purpose.
[133]  1 God Had Not Caused It to Rain upon the Earth
[134]  2 There Was No Man to Till the Ground
[135]  This signifies that there was no man to work with God in coordination by human labor with the divine cf.
[136]  God created man exactly like a bottle with a neck and a mouth.
[137]  Likewise, our body is an outward container and within us is a spirit made by God as a receiver to receive God as the heavenly radio waves.
[138]  God made man a living soul that man may have a soul as his person with his personality and as an organ to contact the psychological realm.
[139]  In between our outward body and our inward spirit is our soul, our person.
[140]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ELEVEN GOD'S PROCEDURES TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE 2
[141]  In the past ten messages we have seen clearly from the holy Word that God's eternal purpose is to express Himself through man and to commit His authority to man that man may exercise His dominion on the earth.
[142]  We have also seen that God's way to fulfill His purpose is by life.
[143]  As the first step in the accomplishment of His purpose, God created mankind in a very specific way, forming them as vessels to contain Himself, not as instruments to work for Him.
[144]  Romans 9 declares definitely that God made man out of clay as vessels of mercy unto honor and glory to contain God Himself.
[145]  Thus, after God created man as vessels with a human spirit to receive Him and to contain Him, He took another step by placing man in front of the tree of life.
[146]  As I mentioned in the last message, when I was a young Christian I was troubled by Genesis 2 because it did not seem to be a classical piece of writing as I felt the Bible ought to be.
[147]  According to Genesis 2:8, this placement was "eastward."
[148]  As we read Genesis 2, we must realize that this record is written in figurative language and that these figures need to be allegorized.
[149]  The fact that the Lord God made every tree which is pleasant to the sight Gen 2:9 means that God wanted to please man and to make him happy.
[150]  God's intention was not that man should work, but that man should be completely pleased and satisfied.
[151]  This is contrary to our religious concept, which is to worship God.
[152]  When I was a young Christian, I saw many long-faced worshipers of God.
[153]  This tree enables man to receive God as life.
[154]  Therefore, the tree of life in the garden was the indicator that God intends to be our life in the form of food.
[155]  If you turn the question to me, I will answer that it was not taller than I. I answer this way because Adam, who had been placed before the tree of life, probably was not much taller than I. If the tree of life had been of a great height, its fruit would have been out of reach.
[156]  This river was made to water the garden that the garden might grow things of life.
[157]  Surely it also quenched man's thirst that he might survive.
[158]  The name of the second head is Gihon, which means turbulence of waters.
[159]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWELVE TRANSFORMATION FOR BUILDING
[160]  In this message I want to consider, as a parenthesis, the precious materials revealed in various portions of the Bible.
[161]  When we come to Revelation 21 and 22, we do not find a garden, but a city.
[162]  Moreover, in the city we find a river of living water proceeding out of the throne of God.
[163]  In the New Testament we have a church built with gold, silver, and precious stones.
[164]  In the Old Testament we have God's people composed with gold and precious stones to become a complete entity.
[165]  In the eyes of God, the breastplate of the high priest was a part of the miniature of the coming New Jerusalem.
[166]  In message eleven we saw that this flow of living water brings forth three kinds of materials.
[167]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE TWO TREES 1
[168]  In the foregoing messages, we have covered God's eternal purpose and some of the points regarding God's way of fulfilling His purpose.
[169]  God's way of accomplishing His purpose was firstly to create man as a vessel to contain Himself as life and then to place him in a garden before the tree of life, indicating that God's intention was for man to partake of the fruit of this tree.
[170]  However, along with the tree of life, Genesis 2:9, 17 mention the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[171]  Although God wanted man to eat of the tree of life, He did not force him to do it.
[172]  The tree of life was a symbol, signifying God as the proper source cf.
[173]  If we only read Genesis 2, we will be unable to understand the meaning of the tree of life.
[174]  Perhaps many of you are not clear about this principle of dependence.
[175]  The second choice was the tree of knowledge Gen 2:17 , which was the opposite of the tree of life.
[176]  Note that this tree was called the tree of knowledge of good and evil, not simply the knowledge of evil.
[177]  It firstly signifies everything apart from God and then it signifies Satan indirectly, because Satan is hidden at the back of the things that are apart from God.
[178]  The contents of the tree of knowledge are all things apart from God.
[179]  Even the experience of Christ that you had today can become the tree of knowledge tomorrow.
[180]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE TWO TREES 2
[181]  In the previous message we have seen that the tree of knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan, who has the power of death, the contents of which are all things apart from God and the nature and result of which are both death.
[182]  Now we have to see what is the principle of this tree.
[183]  The principle of the tree of life and the principle of the tree of knowledge of good and evil are realized throughout the whole Bible.
[184]  All the negative things in the Bible are on the line of the tree of knowledge, and all the positive things are on the line of the tree of life.
[185]  I still have the burden to share further on the two trees from the Gospel of John.
[186]  The Gospel of John is a book of life.
[187]  In this Gospel, many human cases are brought to the Lord, and almost every case is an issue of religion, teaching, or questions of right and wrong.
[188]  As we shall see, the Lord Jesus did not give a yes or no answer to any of the cases.
[189]  As God the Spirit is life and we contact and receive Him as the living water in our spirit, so this worship is in the principle of the tree of life.
[190]  When Adam stood in front of the two trees, he was standing before God and Satan.
[191]  This formed a triangular situation between man, God, and Satan in the universe.
[192]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE LINE OF LIFE
[193]  In this message I have the burden to cover, as a parenthesis, the principle of the tree of life throughout the Scriptures.
[194]  We have pointed out many times that almost everything in the first two chapters of Genesis has been sown there as a seed and that this seed grows gradually in the following books of the Bible, appearing as a crop in the New Testament and ripening as a harvest in the book of Revelation.
[195]  God was very economical in writing the Bible, not wasting a single word.
[196]  The characteristic of Abel's life was that he contacted God in God's way Gen 4:4 .
[197]  Do not say that as long as you contact God everything is all right.
[198]  The fact that Enoch walked with God proves that he loved God.
[199]  He also lived in the appearing of God and called upon the name of the Lord Gen 26:2, 24-25 .
[200]  He did not only inherit all the blessings of his father, but also his way to enjoy God.
[201]  Jacob, as the third generation of the called race, was eventually led by God not to live by his supplanting way, but by the same way of contacting God as his grandfather and his father did.
[202]  When we speak about the children of Israel, it is easy to have a poor impression of them.
[203]  Samuel was another wonderful person in the Old Testament, a man who prayed for the children of God continually.
[204]  The Bible says that Samuel told the people that he would not sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for them 1 Sam 12:23 .
[205]  When Samuel learned that King Saul offended God, he was grieved and cried to the Lord the entire night 1 Sam 15:11 .
[206]  Therefore, the Bible refers to Samuel as a man who called upon the name of the Lord Psa 99:6 and as a man who stood in the presence of God Jer 15:1 .
[207]  All of this reveals to us that Samuel was a person who prayed continually, who called on the name of the Lord, and who stood in the presence of God.
[208]  As we come to the New Testament, we see that the first person on the line of life in the New Testament was the Lord Jesus.
[209]  In John 6 the Lord presented Himself as the life supply also in the form of food, telling us that He is the bread of life v. 35 and that His flesh is eatable v. 55 . If we eat Him, we will have Him as our life and as the life supply by which we live.
[210]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE LINE OF KNOWLEDGE
[211]  We have seen that the Bible opens with two trees, the tree of life, which brings in life, and the tree of knowledge, which brings in knowledge.
[212]  The first line is the line of life, beginning with the tree of life and continuing throughout the Scriptures until it ends at the city of New Jerusalem, where we also see the tree of life Rev 22:1-2, 14 .
[213]  Nimrod was a mighty hunter before the Lord Gen 10:8-11 .
[214]  He was a mighty one in the earth, a person who was absolutely independent of God.
[215]  Pharaoh did not care for God and he was unwilling to know God.
[216]  The failure of the ten spies was looking at the situation in the land by their own sight Num 13:28, 32-33 .
[217]  As they were spying out the land, they saw the giants and the walled cities and were frightened.
[218]  Unlike Joshua and Caleb, they did not turn their eyes to God.
[219]  Although Ahab was born in a nation of God, he was more than independent of God.
[220]  The Scribes and Pharisees held the knowledge of the law, but were still under the slavery of sin John 8:5, 9, 34 .
[221]  They brought a sinful woman to the Lord and, according to their knowledge, demanded a yes or no answer regarding the way in which the woman should be treated.
[222]  Judas was one of the twelve apostles, but he was always in his mind counting money John 12:4-6 .
[223]  He was absolutely on the line of the killing knowledge and not at all on the line of life, even though he was with the Lord Jesus, who was then the tree of life.
[224]  During the time of the apostles there was a philosophy called gnosticism.
[225]  Revelation 2 mentions the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, the teachings of Jezebel, and the depths of Satan Rev 2:14, 15, 20, 24 .
[226]  The early churches were deceived by such teachings and turned away from the eating of the Lord and the feasting with the Lord.
[227]  Therefore, to turn the churches back to the enjoyment of Himself, the Lord made a promise to the churches that if they stay away from this kind of doctrine He will give them to eat of Himself.
[228]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN TO WORK GOD INTO MAN AS LIFE
[229]  Although Genesis 1 and 2 are quite brief, they contain many basic items.
[230]  We have previously pointed out that nearly every item in these two chapters is a seed of divine truth, and that these seeds require the entire Bible to expound and develop them.
[231]  Due to our limited ability to understand them, God was forced to disclose His divine revelation in the way of picture and allegory.
[232]  The first step was to make the vessel, the second was to put this vessel in front of the tree of life, and the third is to work God into man as life.
[233]  What did God do in order to produce a complement for Himself?
[234]  After God finished the work of producing Eve during Adam's sleep, Adam awoke from his sleep.
[235]  As Adam's sleep typifies the death of Christ, so his waking signifies the resurrection of Christ.
[236]  In typology, Adam and Eve became one flesh Gen 2:23-24 .
[237]  In actuality, Christ and the church are one spirit, because he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .
[238]  If we have such a vision as we read the Bible, we will understand the Song of Songs: Christ is our love and we are His beloved.
[239]  We will realize that we have all been reborn and recreated with Christ, that we are now one spirit with Him and with one another, and that on earth today we are living a marriage life with our husband, Christ.
[240]  The Result 1 A Bride Gained Eve Gained by Adam
[241]  The result of Adam's sleep in which his side was opened to release a rib was that he gained Eve as his complement to match him.
[242]  This signifies that the result of Christ's death with His side pierced to release His divine life was that He obtained the church as His complement.
[243]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE FIRST FALL OF MAN
[244]  I love the books of Genesis and Revelation because in them we can see God's purpose and its fulfillment.
[245]  These two books also reveal how the enemy, the subtle one, came in and how he will be cast out.
[246]  The so-called modern critics, who do not believe in the Bible, mainly direct their attacks at the books of Genesis and Revelation.
[247]  According to Genesis 3 through 11 mankind had four falls.
[248]  b "The Serpent," the Incarnation of the Devil
[249]  When Satan approached Eve he was very crafty, pretending to be what he was not and appearing in an incarnational way.
[250]  Although everyone could see the man, few realized that this man was God.
[251]  The significance of the woman is that she represents man before God.
[252]  In the life-study message on Romans 7 we pointed out that Isaiah 54:5 says, "For thy Maker is thine husband."
[253]  Adam and Eve failed because they did not use their spirit.
[254]  Regardless of what you do, if you are independent of God and not contacting Him while you are doing it, it proves that you are not in the spirit.
[255]  As long as I walk, I am using my feet; as long as I see, I am using my eyes; and as long as I contact God, I am using my spirit, since my spirit is the organ by which I contact Him John 4:24 .
[256]  The third step in the process of the fall was the action of the body.
[257]  As a consequence of the fall man's spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God vv.
[258]  Since we have transgressed God's prohibition we not only have a sinful element inwardly, but also a court case outwardly Rom 5:18 .
[259]  We have a case in the heavenly court, a case that was built up by Adam, not by us.
[260]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETEEN GOD'S DEALING WITH MAN'S FIRST FALL 1
[261]  In the previous message we studied the first fall of man, considering its cause, process, and result.
[262]  We have seen how dreadful was the cause, how awful was the process, and how terrible was the result.
[263]  Thank God that Genesis 3 does not stop here!
[264]  Genesis 3 not only unveils the cause, process, and result of man's first fall, but also reveals the way God used to deal with this fall.
[265]  Do you know what was the first word of this gospel preaching?
[266]  It was the question found in Genesis 3:9: "Where art thou?"
[267]  In the earlier years of my ministry when I preached the gospel I used this question as my topic several times.
[268]  When God came to Adam He asked him, "Where art thou?" v. 9 . He also asked him, "Who told thee that thou wast naked?" and "Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?" v. 11 . God also asked the woman, "What is this that thou hast done?" v. 13 . God did not ask Adam and Eve all these questions because He had the intention of condemning them.
[269]  It was certainly a curse for the serpent to creep on his belly and to eat dust all the days of his life.
[270]  As God judged the serpent, He limited Satan's activity and move to the earth.
[271]  "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
[272]  The background of God's promise was that man had been tempted by the serpent and had fallen into sin v. 13 . At that time man was under the fear of God, waiting for the sentence of death vv.
[273]  b Causing Enmity between the Seed of the Serpent
[274]  Adam and Eve were waiting for death, thinking themselves to be under the sentence of death.
[275]  While the Lord Jesus was destroying the serpent on the cross, the serpent bruised His heel.
[276]  This means that Satan wounded the Lord Jesus by nailing His feet to the cross Psa 22:16 .
[277]  As we have seen already, the woman in Genesis 3:15 firstly is Eve and secondly is all the people of God, including the virgin Mary, as signified by Eve.
[278]  The focus, the central point, of Genesis 3:15 is that the seed of woman, the Lord Jesus, would come to destroy Satan on the cross.
[279]  This is the strongest proclamation in the preaching of the glad tidings.
[280]  Once again I say that Adam and Eve were trembling under the imminent sentence of death, but God, instead of condemning them, surprised them by preaching the gospel to them.
[281]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY THE SERPENT, THE WOMAN,
[282]  In this message I am burdened to present, as a parenthesis, a further word on Genesis 3:15.
[283]  Through the fall of man the serpent injected himself into mankind.
[284]  One day the Lord Jesus asked His disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" and Peter immediately responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" Matt 16:15-16 .
[285]  D. As the Evil Spirit Working in Fallen Man
[286]  This evil spirit does not lie dormant, but actively works in the children of disobedience.
[287]  Throughout the generations the woman, the people of God, has been attacked by the serpent.
[288]  We have seen that firstly the seed of the woman is Christ.
[289]  This Christ was born of a woman, even of a virgin Isa 7:14; Matt 1:23; Gal 4:4 .
[290]  We are the co-overcomers with Christ because we have the over-coming seed within us.
[291]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE GOD'S DEALING WITH MAN'S FIRST FALL 2
[292]  In this message we need to consider some further points on the way God deals with man's first fall.
[293]  As we have seen, after man fell God did not come to condemn him, but to seek him and to judge the serpent.
[294]  However, that was not the end. Although God had proclaimed the promise of His salvation, man still remained in a troubled situation.
[295]  Concerning the woman, God has ordained suffering or pain in childbearing Gen 3:16; 1 Tim 2:15 .
[296]  3 Concerning the Man a The Ground Growing Thorns and Thistles
[297]  Concerning the man, the ground grows thorns and thistles Gen 3:17-18 .
[298]  Many of you are not farmers and may think that you can escape from the ground.
[299]  Along with the sufferings ordained by God Adam experienced the anticipated redemption.
[300]  Why do we say that it was an anticipated redemption?
[301]  Although God had not condemned them, although God had sought them out and had ordained suffering as a restriction and protection for them, and although God had proclaimed to them the promise of the coming seed, when Adam and Eve looked at themselves they were still mostly naked.
[302]  Before the skins were taken from the animals, the lambs were undoubtedly sacrificed.
[303]  I believe that God probably killed the lambs in the presence of Adam and Eve and that they witnessed the sacrifice.
[304]  The Closing of the Way to the Tree of Life 1 The Reason
[305]  Although we have seen the ordination of sufferings to restrict, rescue, and guard us and although we have seen the anticipated redemption, there is still a practical problem: What about the tree of life?
[306]  In Genesis 3 the killing of the sword indicates God's righteousness cf.
[307]  If God would kill someone without sin being involved, He could be condemned for acting unjustly.
[308]  Therefore, God's glory, holiness, and righteousness closed the way to the tree of life, indicating that man, as long as he was sinful, was not permitted to contact God as the tree of life.
[309]  4 The Time Limit a Until the Accomplishment of Redemption
[310]  The way to the tree of life was closed during the period of time preceding the accomplishment of redemption by the Lord Jesus.
[311]  By His all-inclusive death on the cross Christ fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness.
[312]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE SECOND FALL OF MAN 1
[313]  After seeing man's first fall and God's proclamation of the glad tidings as recorded in Genesis 3, we now come to Genesis 4.
[314]  Apparently we are studying the fall; actually we are considering the glad tidings.
[315]  Adam believed and called his wife's name "Living"; Eve believed and called her son "acquired," thinking that she had acquired what God had promised.
[316]  Adam and Eve certainly must have preached the gospel to their children, telling Cain and Abel how they had been created by God, how they had been charged by God not to eat of the tree of knowledge, how they had disobeyed God and had eaten of that tree, how they were in fear and trembling as they awaited the sentence of death, and how God came in to preach the gospel by promising them that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent.
[317]  In Genesis 4 we see two kinds of examples.
[318]  When he learned that God did not look upon his offering, "Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell" Gen 4:5 .
[319]  If you serve God, following the way of Abel, meaning that you follow God's way, the so-called religious people will be angry with you and say, "Don't you think that we also are serving God?
[320]  "And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him" Gen 4:8 .
[321]  When we compare this verse with John 8:44, we learn that Cain was not the only murderer; Satan was the murderer as well.
[322]  In this message, a parenthesis in our study of Genesis 4, we need to see more about Cain and Abel.
[323]  During this life-study of Genesis we have pointed out several times that nearly every item found in the first three chapters of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible, especially in the New Testament.
[324]  In the last message we pointed out that Cain was one who served the ground to make a living.
[325]  He is called here "a server of the ground" v. 2, Heb . This means that he was working and living for himself.
[326]  Apparently we do not see the Devil in Genesis 4; we see Cain murdering and lying.
[327]  However, in John 8:44 the Lord Jesus said that that was the Devil murdering and lying.
[328]  In the eyes of God, it was not merely Cain, but the Devil.
[329]  When we are told to worship God, or when we are close to the Lord, trying to care for Him, Satan, the subtle one, often will not tell us not to do it, but will propose a way different from God's revelation in his attempt to keep us from God's economy.
[330]  The way of Cain is to worship God religiously without Christ.
[331]  However, many people have heard of this way, that is, have heard the preaching of the gospel, but have turned aside and have taken their own way, attempting to worship God according to their own concept and trying to do good to please God according to their own desire.
[332]  Thank God for the shedding of the blood of Jesus!
[333]  By it we have the remission of our sins.
[334]  My wife can testify that almost every time we pray together the first word I say is, "Lord, we come to You by Your blood.
[335]  When Cain saw how pleased God was with Abel, His true worshipper, he was jealous.
[336]  Abel did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, thought, or way, but according to God's way of salvation.
[337]  He worshipped God according to His revelation Heb 11:4 .
[338]  When he offered the fat, the sacrifice was killed and the blood was shed, for without killing it would have been impossible to have the fat to present to God.
[339]  He did not hire a priest to offer his sacrifice for him; he did it himself.
[340]  As we have seen in previous messages, in the first fall man ate something wrong.
[341]  When I was a young Christian, I tried to argue with God, asking what was wrong with eating a piece of fruit.
[342]  In Genesis 4 we see that the evil seed which had been injected into man in Genesis 3 firstly manifested itself in what was apparently a good thing worshipping God.
[343]  Cain not only murdered his brother, but also lied to God Himself.
[344]  As a result of man's second fall, God pronounced a greater curse.
[345]  God seemed to be saying, "Since you have done such evil things, the ground will be under a greater curse than it was before.
[346]  His own way was to depart from the presence of God.
[347]  Adam was driven out of paradise, out of the garden of Eden, but Cain went away from the presence of God.
[348]  Although he worshipped God, he eventually left the presence of God.
[349]  Cain left the presence of God and went his own way.
[350]  In the Bible the concept of a city is very significant, and it is possible to trace a line of cities throughout the Scriptures, beginning with Enoch, a city built by Cain, and ending with the New Jerusalem, a city built by God.
[351]  Zillah, Lamech's other wife, brought forth Tubal-cain, who was "an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron" 4:22 , meaning that he was the inventor of weaponry.
[352]  The weapons he produced were for the purpose of killing others.
[353]  In this message we come to the last two verses of Genesis 4.
[354]  In Genesis 4 we find two names which are especially meaningful.
[355]  When we see that we should not be presumptuous, but should live for God and worship Him according to His way and realize the vanity of human life and the fragility of man, we will say, "O Lord, I shouldn't be presumptuous.
[356]  However, when we realize that we must live for Him and worship Him in His way, and when we realize that we are frail and mortal and that our life is nothing but vanity, spontaneously, from deep within us, we not only pray, but call upon the name of the Lord.
[357]  Firstly, we need to learn the meaning of calling on the name of the Lord.
[358]  In 1963 I introduced this hymn to some of the saints in the United States.
[359]  One day, after we had sung this hymn, a dear saint came to me and said, "I can't understand this hymn.
[360]  A few years later, after we had published our hymnal, this same saint said to me, "Brother, my favorite hymn in the hymnal is that hymn on breathing the Lord."
[361]  Whenever we are low, that is, down in a "dungeon," we have to call on the Lord by crying out to Him that we may be released from confinement and receive more of the Lord into us.
[362]  Do not think that calling on the Lord was invented by us.
[363]  3 The Purpose of Calling On the Lord a To Be Saved
[364]  Why do we need to call on the name of the Lord?
[365]  Men need to call on the name of the Lord in order to be saved Rom 10:13 .
[366]  You can help him to be saved by having him pray to the Lord in a very quiet way, and I have seen many persons saved in this manner.
[367]  However, if you would not only help him to pray, but also to call upon the name of the Lord, his experience of salvation would be much stronger.
[368]  Another reason for calling on the Lord is to receive the Spirit Acts 2:17, 21 .
[369]  The best and easiest way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.
[370]  By calling on the name of the Lord we can stir up ourselves.
[371]  Isaiah 64:7 says, "And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee."
[372]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE WAY TO ESCAPE
[373]  Many readers of the Bible have found this chapter to be so dry that they have passed over it in their reading, perhaps, at most, paying attention only to the last twelve verses.
[374]  God's eternal purpose can never be fulfilled without man's multiplication.
[375]  If you had asked Adam what he was doing, he probably would have answered, "Brother, I am living for God's purpose.
[376]  If you do, you need to walk with God.
[377]  To walk with God is not to override God, not to be presumptuous, not to do things according to our own concept and desire, nor to do anything without God.
[378]  To walk with God is to take Him as our center and everything, to do things according to His revelation and leading, and to do everything with Him.
[379]  Although the Bible says little about Enoch, what is revealed in Genesis, Hebrews, and Jude is sufficient for us to appreciate his life.
[380]  This indicates that Enoch not only walked with God, but that he also believed God.
[381]  When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he begat a son giving him the name Methuselah 5:22 .
[382]  In this message we come to the third fall of man, which is recorded in chapter six of Genesis.
[383]  If we study Genesis carefully, we shall realize that the intention of the Holy Spirit is to show man's continuous degradation.
[384]  This interpretation of Genesis 6 is neither my invention nor my discovery.
[385]  When I first studied Genesis 6:2 fifty years ago, I was quite troubled.
[386]  Since the descendants of Seth belonged to God, they were the sons of God.
[387]  This illegal marriage between fallen angels and the human race produced Nephilim.
[388]  We have seen that the first cause of man's third fall was the mingling of evil spirits with humanity.
[389]  The Issue a. The Withdrawing of the Holy Spirit
[390]  When the Spirit is mentioned the second time, we are told that God the Spirit would not strive with man any longer, proving that prior to this the Spirit had been striving and working.
[391]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE WAY OF SALVATION
[392]  In this message we continue our study of the third fall of man.
[393]  Although no one likes to hear the word "fall," we need to realize that the falls portrayed in the book of Genesis are the background of a very positive picture which shows what God has done with the fallen human race.
[394]  Genesis 6:9 tells us that Noah walked with God.
[395]  Undoubtedly, Noah inherited all the spiritual blessings from his forefathers, such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, etc. and he followed his great grandfather, Enoch, to walk with God in a crooked, perverse, and adulterous generation.
[396]  I do believe that he was much influenced by hearing of his great grandfather Enoch's godly walk.
[397]  Most Christians think that grace is merely something given by God.
[398]  If I give you a Bible as a present, that is grace.
[399]  Secondly, because God had been transfused into him, he believed in God.
[400]  Abel offered gifts to God, Enosh called on the name of the Lord, Enoch walked with God but Noah, in addition to doing all of these things did something more he built the ark.
[401]  After Noah received the revelation, he immediately believed in the Word of God Heb 11:7 .
[402]  According to the Bible, to believe always means to believe through the Word.
[403]  In Romans 10:14 Paul asked, "And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?"
[404]  When you come to Him, are infused with Him, and listen to His Word, spontaneously the very God who has been infused into you will believe in and for you.
[405]  Let us follow Noah's steps to find grace, walk with God by faith, receive the revelation, believe in God's Word, testify to people what we believe in, work on what we believe in, and step into what we believe in. Finally, God will lock us in the ark, and we shall be preserved and saved.
[406]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE LIFE AND WORK THAT CHANGED THE AGE
[407]  In this message, a parenthesis in our Life-study of Genesis, I am burdened that we see a crucial point regarding Noah's life that Noah's life and work changed the age.
[408]  Although I had seen this previously in my study of Genesis, I never saw it so impressively as in these days.
[409]  If you read the latter part of Genesis 1, you will see that God created man in His own image for the purpose of expressing Himself 1:26 .
[410]  Man was like a photograph, made in the image of God to express God.
[411]  Let us now look into the life that changed the age.
[412]  I fear and tremble that I may fail God in His revelation.
[413]  The third godly way that Noah inherited was Enosh's way of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy all that He is 4:26 .
[414]  We may partake of the riches of God by calling on the name of the Lord.
[415]  God not only revealed to Noah His need of an ark, but He also showed him the true situation of his generation.
[416]  That generation was thoroughly exposed in the eyes of God.
[417]  God does intend to do something and He is also hungry and thirsty for this.
[418]  Firstly, he praised me very much, saying, "Brother Lee, how we thank God that He has used you and how we thank Him that He has raised up such a wonderful work on the island of Taiwan."
[419]  After Noah received the revelation, he believed it and practiced it 6:22 .
[420]  He practiced it in a way of not caring about being different from his forefathers and from his generation.
[421]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY THE WAY OF SALVATION
[422]  I have been condemned for saying that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit.
[423]  Although I do not like to argue or to answer, I would like to ask those dear brothers who condemn me how they interpret 2 Corinthians 3:17 which says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."
[424]  Do not ask, "Then are the Lord and the Spirit one?"
[425]  Although we cannot explain it adequately, we do have a verse in the Bible which says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."
[426]  The ark was of three stories, the lower, the second, and the third 6:16 .
[427]  Following this, we come to the matter of light.
[428]  Christ is not only the crucified One, but also the One who shed His blood to cover us from the penalty of our sins.
[429]  Philippians 2:12-16 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure..that you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life."
[430]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE SAVED THROUGH WATER D. Saved through Water
[431]  God's salvation to Noah was not only to save him from God's judgment, but also from his crooked, perverse, and evil generation.
[432]  With what does God save us from the condemned world?
[433]  The baptism with water was typified by the flood that saved Noah from his evil age 1 Pet 3:20-21 .
[434]  Noah was baptized in a large baptistery and experienced a very lengthy baptism.
[435]  The principle is the same with the one brass sea and the ten lavers associated with the temple.
[436]  Once the children of Israel were established in the land of Canaan, they built a temple.
[437]  Along with the temple they built a brass sea and ten lavers 1 Kings 7:23, 38 .
[438]  You cannot enter into the presence of God until you pass through the true meaning of baptism, that is, to bury the world.
[439]  In the last message we saw that Noah and the people with him in the ark passed through the flood waters.
[440]  As we have seen, passing through the water was a type of the baptism in the New Testament.
[441]  A Shadow of the Church a. Resurrected with Christ
[442]  The first thing they did upon coming out of the ark was to build an altar and offer sacrifices to God 8:20-22 .
[443]  The first thing in the church life should not be work; it must be the offering of Christ to God through the cross.
[444]  When we experience Christ and bring the Christ whom we have experienced to God, this is what pleases God.
[445]  Offering Christ to God through the cross keeps the curse away.
[446]  As a result of man's first fall, man was put under the curse 3:17 .
[447]  The church life goes back to the beginning for the fulfillment of God's purpose 9:1-2, 6-7 .
[448]  God created man in His own image that he might express Him, and He committed man with His dominion that he might represent Him.
[449]  Living under God's Covenant 1 No More Judgment of Death
[450]  Then God made a covenant with Noah, his seed, and with every living creature 9:8-11 .
[451]  What is the significance of the rainbow that God set in the cloud as a token of the covenant 9:12-17 ?
[452]  In the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, the Apostle John saw God sitting upon a throne, and round about the throne there was a rainbow Rev 4:3 .
[453]  First Corinthians 1:9 says, "God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord," and 1 John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[454]  In this message we shall see more of the shadow of the church life as typified in Genesis 8 and 9, this time seeing something on the negative side.
[455]  When I was young, I felt sorry for the record of the Bible.
[456]  It seemed that whenever God did something Satan would come in to damage it.
[457]  At that time I only saw the black side, not the white side.
[458]  In the prophecy spoken through Noah, it was stated clearly that Japheth would be enlarged by God 9:27 .
[459]  In the past several messages we have mainly covered the history of Noah.
[460]  In those messages we saw how the ark made by Noah passed through the water and ushered Noah and his family into a new age.
[461]  According to typology, at that time Noah and his family were living in resurrection, and that kind of living was a shadow of the church life.
[462]  This shadow of the church life in resurrection reveals how the church people are resurrected with Christ, how they worship God with Christ, and how they resume God's original purpose of expressing God and representing Him.
[463]  We have also seen that, unfortunately, in that shadow of the church life there was a failure, for, in a sense, Noah, God's deputy authority, failed God.
[464]  Although they were one because the family element held them together, the main factor of their oneness was their one God.
[465]  Thus, the main factor that preserved the oneness of the new race was that they had no God other than the one, true God.
[466]  They were divided because they began to have different worships and because they had different goals, interests, and purposes.
[467]  Genesis 10:31 reveals four ways in which the people were divided: according to their families; according to their languages, that is, according to their different words, concepts, understandings, and utterances; according to their different lands; and according to their different nations.
[468]  When I was saved, all the pastors and ministers were happy to use the word denomination.
[469]  Then the Lord raised us up to condemn the denominations, and the pastors and ministers stopped using this term.
[470]  Although they no longer used the term denomination, they still held on to the different names.
[471]  Wilson of the United States and the leaders of Great Britain and France formed the League of Nations in an attempt to unite all the nations of the world.
[472]  This was the reason that the Apostle Paul admonished us all to "speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion" 1 Cor 1:10 , and "to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one accord and one mouth glorify" God Rom 15:5-6 .
[473]  As long as we all worship one God and believe in the one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was incarnated to be our Savior, who died on the cross for our sins by shedding His blood for our redemption, who was resurrected on the third day, and who is now the Lord in the heavens as well as life within us, we should all be one and not be divided by anything.
[474]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE LIFE IN RESURRECTION 4 2.
[475]  In previous messages we have seen many of the riches that are found in the book of Genesis.
[476]  We have already seen that, after the flood, Noah and his family lived a life in resurrection and that such a life was a shadow of the church.
[477]  If you read Genesis 9 carefully, you will see a shadow of the kingdom.
[478]  There, in Genesis 9, we see the shadow of the kingdom of God on earth among men.
[479]  The ruling with God-given authority among men on the new earth signifies the reigning of God's kingdom in resurrection life.
[480]  When we come to the end of the Bible, we see that the kingdom will result in a very unpleasant situation in a great rebellion.
[481]  When the church was built, the kingdom was established.
[482]  The building up of the church was the establishment of the kingdom.
[483]  In verse 18 the Lord said, "On this rock I will build My church," and in verse 19 He said to Peter, "I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens."
[484]  But this reigning is not in our flesh or in our natural life.
[485]  According to the type of the kingdom found in Genesis, the kingdom issued in the rebellion at Babel.
[486]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX THE FOURTH FALL OF MAN F. The Fourth Fall
[487]  In this message we come to chapter eleven of Genesis.
[488]  According to the divine record in the book of Genesis, mankind has had four falls.
[489]  The first fall was that of Adam in chapter three, the second was that of Cain in chapter four, and the third was that of the crooked and perverse generation before the deluge recorded in chapter six.
[490]  The first level was that man fell from God's presence to man's conscience.
[491]  According to Genesis 2, after God created man, He put him in front of Himself.
[492]  Man did not remain very long under the government of his conscience.
[493]  His lying to God about Abel's death was an open manifestation of his breaking of his conscience.
[494]  The fall from self-government to human government, however, was not the final fall.
[495]  The second factor of the cause of the fourth fall was the rebellion of the human race.
[496]  As we have seen, the issue was a matter of who would have the right in this universe, of who would have authority on earth.
[497]  The tower was also built for the purpose of making themselves a name.
[498]  In seeking to make themselves a name, they denied God's name, that is, they denied God Himself.
[499]  What offended God the most was that the purpose of building the tower of Babel was to make a name for man.
[500]  If you read the next chapter, Genesis 12, carefully, you will see that when Abraham went into the good land, he did not build a tower to make himself a name; he built an altar that he might call on the name of the Lord 12:7-8 .
[501]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GOD'S CALLING V. GOD'S CALLING Introduction
[502]  In this message we come to the most wonderful section of the book of Genesis, the section on God's calling 11:10 50:26 .
[503]  Genesis, a book of fifty chapters, is divided into three sections.
[504]  Although Satan, working through fallen man, had apparently driven God out from the earth, God is sovereign and cannot be defeated or frustrated by any kind of attack.
[505]  Although sometimes I was sorry that I was a fallen person, most of the time I rejoiced, because I had been redeemed, regenerated, and regained.
[506]  In the next message we shall see that God promised to make Abraham a great nation and that this nation is the kingdom of God including Israel as God's kingdom in the Old Testament, the church as God's kingdom in the New Testament, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and also the new heaven and the new earth.
[507]  Now we need to consider the significance, the meaning, of God's calling.
[508]  The picture that is portrayed in Abraham is very clear.
[509]  He had the new beginning, the transfer of race, and the transfer of life, which was a great problem to both him and God.
[510]  Although the new beginning and the transfer of race in him transpired immediately at the time that he was called, the transfer of life in him took many years.
[511]  When God called Abraham out of the corrupted land, Abraham had no sons, no successors.
[512]  Because Abraham was childless, he relied upon Eliezer, his household servant, to be the possessor of his house, saying to the Lord, "Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of possession of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
[513]  Later, when God told Abraham that Eliezer would not be his heir and that only the one born of himself would be his heir, God strongly confirmed His promise that Abraham would have seed of himself 15:2-5 .
[514]  At the time when God changed Abraham's name and commanded him to be circumcised, God said to him in 17:21 "...Isaac, which Sarah shall bare unto thee at this set time in the next year."
[515]  Here we see that God made an appointment, setting up a time when Isaac would be born.
[516]  This is referred to in 18:14 when the Lord said, "At the time appointed I will return unto thee, at the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son" Heb .
[517]  In a sense, in Isaac the transfer of life was accomplished but it was not fully completed.
[518]  We know this by the fact that Isaac still begat Esau whom God hated Rom 9:13 .
[519]  In principle, the experience is the same with the believers today.
[520]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE BACKGROUND AND ORIGIN OF GOD'S CALLING
[521]  Although Genesis is a long book, it has only three sections: God's creation 1:1 2:25 , the serpent's corruption 3:1 11:9 , and Jehovah's calling 11:10 50:26 .
[522]  God's calling means the new beginning of God, the transfer of race, and the transfer of life.
[523]  Now in this message we need to see the experience of the called ones.
[524]  But before we come to this, we need to consider the background and origin of God's calling.
[525]  When God appeared to Abraham, he was in the darkest background.
[526]  As we have seen, after the flood God gave man the authority to rule others, but Satan caused man to abuse this God-given authority to form nations that man may have his own dominion, denying God's right and authority over man.
[527]  Although he was the father of the called race, the calling was not initiated by him.
[528]  As you read the book of Genesis, you will notice that the records of Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah are quite distinct one from another.
[529]  The records of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, however, overlap.
[530]  Abraham's original name was Abram which means "an exalted father," and the name Abraham, that replaced this name, means "the father of a great multitude."
[531]  Abraham had a good beginning with being called, but there is no record of his being chosen or of his reaching an ultimate and matured end. For his completion, Abraham had the need of Jacob's being chosen and of Jacob's matured end. Do you believe that, according to the record of Genesis, Abraham attained to the highest and consummate maturity of life? We cannot find such a record.
[532]  Abraham's offering Isaac on the altar was the climax of his spiritual life ch.
[533]  In his experience, Jacob had the best, highest, and most matured end. Although he began as a subtle supplanter, after being dealt with by God, he matured to the uttermost.
[534]  Although there are so many good ones, such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, in the book of Genesis, no one is as mature as Jacob.
[535]  When God appeared to him in a dream at Bethel, Jacob said upon waking, "If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on..then shall the Lord be my God..and of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" 28:20-22 .
[536]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE MOTIVE AND STRENGTH OF BEING CALLED
[537]  In the last message we saw that the Triune God dealt with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as one complete corporate man.
[538]  If we are going to get into the last section of the book of Genesis, the section on God's calling, we need to remember that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate and complete units but, under God's dispensation, are one complete corporate man.
[539]  The first aspect of the motive and strength to accept God's calling was God's appearing.
[540]  If I were to come to you, it would mean nothing because I am nothing.
[541]  If the president of the United States were to pay you a personal visit, you would be very excited.
[542]  Outside of Stephen's word in Acts 7:2, where Stephen told his persecutors that the God of glory appeared to their father Abraham, there is no other verse in the Bible that says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham.
[543]  The second factor of the motive and strength was God's calling Acts 7:3-4; Gen 12:1 .
[544]  When God came to Abraham, telling him to get out of his country, Abraham might have said within himself, "What about the matter of being a nation?"
[545]  4 God's Promise Being the Gospel Preached to Abraham
[546]  When I read 12:2-3 as a young man, I was not inspired by it.
[547]  I did not understand what God was talking about when He told Abraham that He would make of him a great nation, and that He would bless him, and make him a blessing.
[548]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FORTY THE PROGRESS IN ANSWERING GOD'S CALLING
[549]  As we have pointed out many times, nearly every item in the book of Genesis is a seed.
[550]  In this message we come to the seed of river crossing, to the experience of the first river crosser.
[551]  Why did God need to appear to Abraham twice and call him twice?
[552]  But Abraham was not that high; he was as low as we are.
[553]  In His second calling God added another item, telling Abraham not only to come out of his country and his kindred but also out of his father's house 12:1 .
[554]  Regardless of how long Abraham delayed in answering God's calling, he could not delay God very long.
[555]  According to God's feeling, a thousand years are the same as a day.
[556]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE LIVING BY FAITH
[557]  In all of human history there has never been a book as wonderful as the Bible.
[558]  It is not a history in a human way but in a very divine way.
[559]  If you say that you have been called, I would ask you this question: What is the seal of your calling?
[560]  In this chapter we see that Abraham had difficulty with Lot.
[561]  After Lot had separated from Abraham, leaving him alone, God reappeared to Abraham again.
[562]  An altar means that our life is for God, that God is our life, and that the meaning of our life is God.
[563]  After Abraham built an altar to the Lord at Moreh, he traveled through the land.
[564]  God did not give him just one little spot; He gave him a spacious land.
[565]  In his travels, Abraham came to a place that was between Bethel and Ai.
[566]  3 Expression the Tent a Because All the Things He Had Were for God
[567]  After Abraham built an altar, he pitched a tent 12:7-8 .
[568]  The first thing he did was to take care of the worship of God, of his fellowship with God.
[569]  His altar was the beginning of his testimony for God to the world, whereas his tent was the completion of his testimony to the world for God.
[570]  d Sojourning by Faith as in a Strange Country
[571]  Do you not have a tent where you always have the Lord's presence?
[572]  Whenever we answer God's calling and God reappears to us and we build an altar for God, telling Him that everything we are and have is for Him, we shall immediately erect a tent.
[573]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE TRIAL OF THE CALLED
[574]  We have seen how Abraham was called by God and how, by God's appearing, he was strengthened to answer that call.
[575]  Firstly he was brought to Shechem 12:6 and then to the place between Bethel and Ai, the place between the house of God and the heap of ruins 12:8 .
[576]  When Abraham and Sarah came to the border of Egypt, he said to her, "It shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive" 12:12 .
[577]  Fearing that the Egyptians would kill him and take his wife, Abraham prayed to Sarah, not to God saying, "Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee" 12:13 .
[578]  By this one experience in Egypt Abraham learned that the God who called him also took care of him and that everything was in His hand.
[579]  As long as you are one of God's called ones, He will take care of you whether or not you believe in Him or trust in Him.
[580]  After passing through the experience in chapter twelve, it might be easy for Abraham or for us to say, "Praise the Lord, I have learned the lesson!"
[581]  But some tests are needed to prove whether or not we have truly learned the lesson.
[582]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE THE VICTORY OF THE CALLED 5 Victory
[583]  If we read the book of Genesis carefully, we shall see that apart from chapter fourteen it does not relate much concerning the international affairs among the Gentiles.
[584]  In the matter of the capture of Lot, God was sovereign.
[585]  Genesis 14:13 says, "And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew."
[586]  The four kings had captured Sodom and all of its food supply, but one person who escaped told Abraham that Lot had been captured.
[587]  After you have been called and have answered God's calling by coming to the place where He intends you to be, the first basic lesson that God will teach you is that, as a called one of God, everything concerning you is under God's hand.
[588]  How was it possible for one who escaped to have come to Abraham, and how could Abraham have made such a brief and bold decision?
[589]  What happened so that, after a short time, the enemy ran away?
[590]  The people in our environment may find it difficult to see where Christ is.
[591]  When Melchisedec came to Abraham, he blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth v. 19 . This proves that he was greater than Abraham Heb 7:6-7 . He also blessed God for Abraham's victory v. 20 . Our victory always causes our Melchisedec to grant us blessing and to give blessing to God.
[592]  Abraham's victory regulated and restituted the whole situation and rearranged the entire environment.
[593]  The four kings had defeated the five kings and had captured everything.
[594]  In this message we come to a great turn in Abraham's experience of God.
[595]  Do not be proud, for once God removes your food supply, you will bow down and say, "O God, help me!"
[596]  Genesis 15:1 says, "After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
[597]  When God came in to speak these words, Abraham was still in an elementary stage.
[598]  The Lord said to Abraham, "This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir" 15:4 .
[599]  The Lord seemed to be saying to Abraham, "I didn't care for Lot.
[600]  Prior to chapter fifteen, Abraham had experienced God as the One who protected him and provided many material things 12:16 .
[601]  It is from chapter fifteen through chapter twenty-four that we have a record showing us how God had worked something into Abraham so that he was able to fulfill God's purpose.
[602]  Abraham was the same as we are, and we are the same as he was.
[603]  When Abraham understood that he needed a seed, he counted on Eliezer 15:2-4 .
[604]  Abraham seemed to say, "Now I realize that I must have a seed for God to have a people.
[605]  But God will never use for the fulfillment of His purpose the things that we already have.
[606]  Eventually, Paul could say, "By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me" 1 Cor 15:10 .
[607]  After rejecting Abraham's proposal, God promised him that He would do something for him so that he might have seed born of himself, even as many as the stars in heaven 15:5 .
[608]  Abraham believed in the Lord according to His word, and the Lord counted his believing to him for righteousness 15:6 .
[609]  It is the kind of faith that believes that God will work in us to bring forth Christ, the seed, that is precious to God and is our righteousness in the eyes of God.
[610]  Thus, we see five points concerning the land: that it was a place for God's people to live in, a place for them to live on, a place where God's enemies could be defeated, a place where God could have His kingdom, and a place where God could have a habitation for His expression.
[611]  In the last message we saw that whatever Abraham experienced prior to Genesis 15 was a matter of God's blessing for his existence.
[612]  But God's calling of Abraham was not merely that Abraham should exist; it was that God's eternal purpose might be fulfilled through him.
[613]  Beginning with chapter fifteen, God came in to show Abraham that he needed grace for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.
[614]  If we read Genesis 15 through 22 carefully, we shall see that in these chapters God was dealing with Abraham in order to bring him to the realization that he needed His grace in order to fulfill His eternal purpose.
[615]  So God came in not simply to bless Abraham outwardly but to work Himself into him as grace in order that Abraham might have something substantial for the carrying out of God's eternal purpose.
[616]  The seed that God promised Abraham is today the corporate Christ, and the land that God promised him is the wonderful resurrected and elevated Christ in whom we rest and slaughter our enemies and in whom God establishes His kingdom and builds up His habitation that He might be expressed and represented.
[617]  After this, however, when God also promised Abraham that He would give him the land, Abraham fell short, saying to the Lord, "Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" v. 8 . Although he was able to believe in God for the promise concerning the seed, he could not believe in Him for the promise concerning the land.
[618]  Many Christians believe in God for Christ's being their life, but when they come to the matter of the church life, the good land where we can rest, slaughter the enemies, and afford God the ground to establish His kingdom and build up His habitation, they say that it is impossible for us to have this today.
[619]  It is not such a simple matter to have Christ as the land for us to live in so that we may have the church life and that God may have His kingdom with His habitation for His expression and representation.
[620]  3 God Confirming His Promise by Making a Covenant
[621]  The two birds, neither of which was killed, signify the resurrected, living Christ Lev 14:6-7 .
[622]  This resurrected Christ is mainly in His divinity because, according to the Bible, a dove in typology signifies the Holy Spirit John 1:32 .
[623]  Therefore, while the cattle typify Christ in His humanity, the birds typify Him in His divinity.
[624]  So the birds in Genesis 15 signify the heavenly Christ, the Christ who came from and who still is in heaven John 3:13 , the Christ who was and who still is living.
[625]  When the sacrifices were made ready, the fowl from the air came down trying to eat them v. 11 . This signifies that Satan and his angels come to make Christ of none effect for the church life Gal 5:2, 4 . Today Satan and his angels 2 Cor 11:13-15 are doing their best to rob Christians of the enjoyment of Christ for the church life Col 2:8 . As Abraham drove the fowl away, so we must drive Satan and his angels away from what Christ is to us for the church life.
[626]  When Abraham was in this kind of situation, God came in. Verse 17 says, "And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a torch of fire that passed between those pieces" v. 18, Heb . God did not come in a very lovely way but as a smoking furnace and as a flaming torch.
[627]  Whenever people offered something to God in the Old Testament, they laid their hand upon the sacrifice, signifying their union or identification with it.
[628]  God's asking Abraham to offer the cattle and birds to Him implied that Abraham had to be one with all of the things that he offered to God.
[629]  God seemed to be saying to him, "Abraham, you must be in union with all of the things that you offer to Me. You must be identified with the cattle and the birds." This indicates that we also have to be cut in Christ's being cut and crucified in His crucifixion.
[630]  History proves that Abraham's seed did suffer affliction for a period of four hundred years beginning with Ishmael's persecution of Isaac 21:9; Gal 4:29 about 1891 B.C. until the exodus out of Egypt about 1491 B.C. Exo 3:7-8; Acts 7:6 . Ishmael's mocking of Isaac was the start of the affliction of Abraham's seed that was to continue for four hundred years.
[631]  When we read the book of Genesis, we need the divine enlightenment, for by our human mentality we cannot get anything out of this book except historical records and some interesting stories.
[632]  When I was young, I was happy to hear the stories in this book, but if we only understand Genesis as a story book, we shall miss a great deal.
[633]  We have seen that Abraham answered God's calling in the way of dragging his feet through mud and water.
[634]  Since God did not give Abraham a child, Abraham took Lot, his nephew, along with him.
[635]  Abraham could not say that he had nothing, because he had taken Lot with him.
[636]  Furthermore, it might have been that as he was traveling through Damascus, he found Eliezer and took him along with him.
[637]  Although Abraham was not free to argue with God, within himself he probably said to God, "God, You don't need to promise me over and over again that You will give me a boy.
[638]  Sarah, the freewoman, signifies the covenant of promise Gal 4:23 .
[639]  In that covenant God promised that He would give Abraham the seed, without having any intention that Abraham needed to do anything in order to have it.
[640]  It was when the children of Israel ignored God's work of grace upon them and attempted to please God by themselves that the law was brought in. When man is ignorant of God's grace, he will always endeavor to do something to please God, and this brings in the law, of which Hagar, the bondwoman, the improper wife of Abraham, was the symbol.
[641]  e The Produce Ishmael by the Effort of the Flesh
[642]  After we were saved, we came to realize that God wants us to live a Christ-like life, a heavenly life, a victorious life, a life that constantly pleases God and glorifies Him.
[643]  Yes, God does want us to live such a life, but He will work Christ into us to live for us a heavenly life to please Him and glorify Him.
[644]  So firstly we rely upon our Lot, that which we brought with us from our natural background, trying to use him to fulfill God's purpose in living a heavenly life for the glory of God.
[645]  When God does not allow us to rely upon Lot, then we turn to Eliezer, expecting that he will enable us to live a heavenly life for God's glory.
[646]  There are a great many Hagars in the Christian world today.
[647]  Do you want to live a Christian life by yourself?
[648]  Although Abraham fully answered God's call when he was seventy-five, God did not do anything with him until he was ninety-nine because until then he still had his natural strength.
[649]  In this message we come to Genesis 17, a record of God's crucial dealing with Abraham in confirming His covenant.
[650]  If we commit a sin, we would immediately confess it to God, but if we do certain good things by our natural self, we do not have the sense that we are offending God.
[651]  Genesis 17:1 says, "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the all-sufficient God; walk before me, and be thou perfect" Heb .
[652]  In chapter sixteen, Abraham did not walk before God; he walked before Sarah, Hagar, and Ishmael.
[653]  God does not want you to energize your strength to produce a seed for the fulfillment of His purpose; He wants you to drink of His milk, to take something of Himself into you so that you might produce a seed.
[654]  For Abraham to be imperfect did not mean that he was not good; it meant that he was short of God.
[655]  Regardless of how perfect we may be in ourselves, we are still short of God and need to be perfected by and with God.
[656]  In 17:5 God said to Abraham, "Neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
[657]  In order for us to have God added into us and to be broadened we need to be circumcised.
[658]  The covenant that God made with Abraham in Genesis 15 was confirmed in Genesis 17 with circumcision.
[659]  There was no need for God to confirm it again, for He had confirmed it once already, but it had to be confirmed from Abraham's side.
[660]  While God was faithful to His covenant, Abraham was not because he had used his natural strength to produce Ishmael.
[661]  Since Abraham's use of his natural energy with Hagar to produce Ishmael was the cause of the trouble, God confirmed His covenant by having Abraham circumcised 17:9-11, 13 .
[662]  Colossians 2:11-12 says, "In whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, buried together with Him in baptism, in whom also you were raised together through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from among the dead."
[663]  In 17:15-21 we see the birth of Isaac promised more definitely than ever before.
[664]  We know that it is more definite because the name Isaac was mentioned and his mother was designated.
[665]  In the foregoing chapters, God said that He would give Abraham a seed and that Abraham would bring forth the seed, but God did not mention that the seed would be out of Sarah.
[666]  But in these verses we see that God promised in a definite way that the seed would be Isaac and that Isaac would be born of Sarah.
[667]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT
[668]  In order to have a collective people as His expression, God created the universe and within the universe, as its center, He created man in His image with the intention that man would express Him and represent Him so that He may have a dominion on earth as His kingdom.
[669]  By coming into you, I will have you crucified and then I will make you alive by, with, and for Me. Are you willing for this?" Abraham did not wait for God to do this, but, as Genesis 16 reveals, he acted on his own to bring forth a seed.
[670]  In 17:1 God came in to unveil His divine title, unveiling what He, the very God, is.
[671]  To unveil a name is to unveil a person, for a name always represents a person.
[672]  In 1:1 God was unveiled as Elohim, which primarily means the Mighty One, the Strong One, and which is mainly related to God's creation.
[673]  Although religion tells us that we must do certain things for God, what God wants us to do is to take Him in as our supply so that He may become our constituent and that we may become one with Him.
[674]  Not only must God's title be unveiled to us, but our names need to be changed, meaning that we need to be changed.
[675]  Not only Abraham's name was to be changed but also Sarah's.
[676]  The name Sarai, which means my princess, has to be changed to Sarah, which means princess.
[677]  "My princess" has to be changed to "princess," to "a mother of nations."
[678]  Your particular character has to be changed into a general one so that you can be a mother of nations and take care of many people.
[679]  By the Lord's mercy, we have no confidence in ourselves or in anyone else.
[680]  We do not have confidence in people because we have learned that no one is qualified to fulfill God's purpose.
[681]  The proper church life is that which carries out God's eternal purpose through being supplied with the riches of God Himself.
[682]  With this as the background, we come now to the matter of circumcision 17:9-14 .
[683]  At the time of Genesis 17, Abraham had been robbed of all the places where he had been and of all the important persons he had acquired.
[684]  Although he was in the land that God had promised to give him, it had not yet been given to him.
[685]  a The Significance of Circumcision 1 To Put off Our Flesh
[686]  Firstly, it is to put off our flesh Col 2:11, 13a; Deut 10:16; Jer 4:4a; Acts 7:51 .
[687]  Circumcision in the Old Testament is the equivalent of baptism in the New Testament Col 2:11-12 .
[688]  Both baptism and circumcision have the same purpose to terminate our natural being and bring us into resurrection.
[689]  Because we realize that our old man has been crucified with Him and that we must be buried so that we may be one with Him in His resurrection.
[690]  Colossians 2:11 speaks of "the circumcision of Christ."
[691]  The book of Colossians reveals that Christ is our eternal portion 1:12 , our life 3:4 , and our hope of glory 1:27 , and that we must live by Him as the seed and walk in Him as the land 2:6 .
[692]  We who have been buried with Christ have been brought into His resurrection, not by our effort but by the operation of God, which is carried out by the Spirit of God.
[693]  When we realize that we have been terminated with Christ, buried with Him, and ushered into His resurrection, the indwelling Spirit will honor our realization with an operation, minister the riches of Christ into us, and make us a person in resurrection.
[694]  In this message we come to Genesis 18, which contains an intimate record of Abraham's experience with God.
[695]  If we take an overall view of Abraham's experience with God as found in chapter eleven through chapter twenty-four, we shall see that his experience is in four major sections.
[696]  Firstly, while he was living in the demonic land of Chaldea, he was called by God.
[697]  He had been called by God for the fulfillment of God's divine purpose, but, as a human being, he still had to have food, protection, and all that was necessary to maintain his existence.
[698]  Immediately after this, he was ushered into a glorious section living in fellowship with God 18:1 24:67 .
[699]  Which do you think is more pleasant for God to sit on His throne demanding that we bow down to Him and worship Him, or for God to sit under a tree and wash His feet?
[700]  No human being could have known at that time that Sarah was laughing within, but the Lord said, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?" v. 13 . At this juncture, the Lord clearly unveiled to Abraham that He was Jehovah God by saying, "Is anything too marvelous for the Lord Jehovah ?" When Sarah denied laughing He said, "Nay; but thou didst laugh" v. 15 , indicating that He was the omniscient God, the One who knows everything, even what is in man's heart.
[701]  He had not only been called and learned to live by faith in God for his existence, but he had learned to reject and deny his natural strength and to trust in God for everything for the fulfillment of His purpose.
[702]  After becoming such a person, he began to live in fellowship with God.
[703]  In his circumcised state, God came to visit him, and as a circumcised person Abraham had an intimate communion with the visiting God.
[704]  It is after our flesh has been circumcised and our natural man has been terminated that God comes to visit us and we minister water and food to Him for His refreshment and satisfaction in our intimate fellowship with Him.
[705]  Whenever we enjoy a good time with God, having intimate fellowship with Him, at that time Christ not only is supplied to us, but we offer Christ to God, offering Him the riches of Christ for His enjoyment.
[706]  As Abraham was enjoying such sweet fellowship with God, he received revelation from Him regarding the birth of Isaac and the destruction of Sodom.
[707]  These are the two basic things concerning which God will always deal with us.
[708]  The birth of Isaac is related to Christ, and the destruction of Sodom is related to God's judgment upon sin.
[709]  Today God is not only accomplishing His plan to fulfill His purpose, but as the Lord over all men He is also judging sin.
[710]  As Abraham was bringing God on His way, "The Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" v. 17 . God could not hide His intention from Abraham, but told him of His intention to judge Sodom saying, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know" vv.
[711]  In this message we come to another seed of the divine revelation sown in the book of Genesis the seed of intercession.
[712]  Since God did not come to Abraham in His glory with His majesty, Abraham did not recognize at first that it was Jehovah God who was visiting him.
[713]  Although God remained at Abraham's tent door for several hours, talking a great deal to him, God did not say a word about His purpose in coming to secure an intercessor.
[714]  Perhaps you want a brother to do a certain thing for you.
[715]  If you are wise, you will not come to him and immediately ask him to do what you desire.
[716]  At the very end of your visit, as the brother is seeing you to the door or conducting you on your way, you may open yourself to him and tell him of your desire.
[717]  However, if he does not linger with you but says, "See you in the meeting tonight," you will realize that his heart is too cold and that he would not be interested in doing what you want him to do.
[718]  Only when God rose up and walked away from the tent and Abraham accompanied and conducted Him and the two angels on their way, did God tell Abraham of His intention.
[719]  Then, in chapter eighteen God came to him at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron not as the God of glory nor as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, nor as the El-Shaddai, but as a mortal man to enjoy a meal with His intimate friend.
[720]  Apparently Abraham interceded for Sodom; actually he interceded for Lot.
[721]  The proof is in 19:29: "And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
[722]  Whenever we have the deep sense that God has come to us on a human level, we shall realize that this is the time when God will initiate an intercession for us to carry out.
[723]  When Abraham challenged God, God might have said, "I have found a man on earth who knows My heart so well that he does not pray, ask, or beg; He challenges Me. I must do what he says because I have been challenged by My dear friend.
[724]  Abraham's challenge to God was according to God's righteous way 18:23-25 .
[725]  If we say this, God might say, "Yes, I am a loving God, but to love is up to Me. When I feel happy, I love.
[726]  As I read through the verses about Lot again and again, I could not find a hint that God ever appeared to him.
[727]  Although God and the two angels visited Abraham, only the two angels came to Lot.
[728]  Does this mean that God is unfair or a respecter of persons?
[729]  God did not appear to Lot or reveal Himself to Lot, because Lot was passive, not actively seeking God, and was living in a wicked city.
[730]  He did not follow God in a direct way but in an indirect way and did not walk in the way of God.
[731]  Lot left others' spiritual influence because of material substance 13:5-13 .
[732]  Lot was sovereignly warned by being captured 14:11-12 .
[733]  God was merciful to him, not allowing him to live in Sodom peacefully.
[734]  As a warning and a discipline, God caused Lot to be captured.
[735]  Lot's children were corrupted by living in the wicked city.
[736]  The word of the angels in 19:12 indicates that Lot might have had sons as well as daughters.
[737]  In chapter eighteen Abraham might have considered that there were at least ten people in Lot's family.
[738]  The angels said to Lot, "Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord has sent us to destroy it" 19:12-13 .
[739]  Lot had to tell his sons-in-law and his children that God was about to judge that city.
[740]  Lot's wife was saved from destruction, but she became a pillar of salt 19:15-17, 26; Luke 17:32 .
[741]  That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt meant that she had lost her usefulness in the hand of God and had become a sign of shame.
[742]  The previous message was on Lot, who was a defeated righteous man.
[743]  The record of Lot's wife becoming a pillar of salt is found in the section on living in fellowship with God.
[744]  Although this section in Genesis covering chapters eighteen through twenty-four is the record of a life that was in fellowship with God, it includes the black record of a defeated saved man, his wife, and his two daughters.
[745]  We were sent here by God to rescue you and all your family, but only these have been found.
[746]  As we have already pointed out, there is no doubt that Lot's wife was saved from destruction.
[747]  This is so definitely and clearly revealed that no one can argue with it.
[748]  Although the Bible teaches us to love others, here Luke 14:26, a holy word out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus, says, "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, his own soul life also, he cannot be My disciple."
[749]  Believers who live in the world as the worldly people and seek to save their soul, their soul-life, will suffer shame as did Lot's wife, and will lose their soul at the Lord's coming back Luke 17:28-33 .
[750]  The children of God who do not abide in the Lord as the anointing teaches will be put to shame at the Lord's coming back 1 John 2:27-28 .
[751]  As I have pointed out many times, nearly all the seeds of the divine revelation are found in the book of Genesis.
[752]  Let us now consider these six points in more detail.
[753]  Based upon the principle that everything in the book of Genesis is a seed, we may say that Abraham's tent, in which he had intimate fellowship with God on the human level, was a miniature of the tabernacle which God commanded Abraham's descendants to build as His dwelling place on earth.
[754]  Today's church, as the real dwelling of God on earth, is the fulfillment of what has been portrayed in the Old Testament by Abraham's tent, the tabernacle, and the temple.
[755]  After Lot's group had left God's witness and testimony, they drifted into the wicked city of Sodom 13:12-13; 19:1 .
[756]  If you leave the church life, you will be defeated.
[757]  Like a piece of driftwood that cannot control its direction but is carried along by the current, you will drift with the tide of this age and float downward until you find yourself in a wicked city.
[758]  Concerning the testimony of God, the leaders are slumbering and sleeping.
[759]  Lot's daughters had lost their sense of morality, having been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world.
[760]  If they had had any sense of morality, they never would have considered lying with their father.
[761]  The names of their two sons are very meaningful.
[762]  After Genesis 18 and 19, in which we see Abraham's high attainment in his experience of God, there is a record of his weakness in Genesis 20.
[763]  Can you believe that after having such intimate fellowship with God and after making such a glorious intercession, Abraham could have the experience recorded in chapter twenty?
[764]  After Abraham had left God's presence and had journeyed toward the south, he repeated an old failure lying by sacrificing his wife 20:2; cf.
[765]  Abraham told Abimelech, "It came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother" v. 13 . This hidden weakness was kept within Abraham even after he had been circumcised.
[766]  Then God told him that he must restore Abraham's wife and that Abraham would pray for him v. 7 . God did not inspire Abraham to pray for Abimelech; rather, He indicated to Abimelech that Abraham was a prophet and had the position to pray for the king and his family.
[767]  After receiving the gifts from Abimelech, Abraham prayed for him vv.
[768]  Abimelech might have said to Abraham, "Why did you, a prophet of God, lie to me?
[769]  In the foregoing messages we have covered nearly ten chapters in Genesis regarding Abraham's experience with God.
[770]  In those chapters we saw that Abraham, God's called one, had come to many stations and had passed through many stages.
[771]  In the first section we see the birth of Isaac vv.
[772]  3, 6 , was born according to God's promise v. 1 at the appointed time, the time of life v. 2; 17:21; 18:10, 14 . As far as Abraham and Sarah were concerned, the birth of Isaac was a great matter.
[773]  If you consider the experience of Abraham as recorded in chapters eleven through twenty and compare it with your own, you may be surprised to see that his experience is the same as yours and that his life is your biography.
[774]  After the birth, there is the need of growth.
[775]  Verse 8 says that "the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned."
[776]  I thank God that Christ has been brought forth among us, but I hesitate to say that we have had much of the growth of Christ.
[777]  Sarah, the one who represented grace, would not tolerate Ishmael's mocking of Isaac and said, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac" v. 10 . When I read this verse as a youth, I did not agree with Sarah, thinking that she was jealous and unfair.
[778]  It was she who proposed to Abraham that he have a son by Hagar and now she tells him to cast Hagar and Ishmael out.
[779]  But one day, as I was thinking in this way, God rebuked me.
[780]  That day I was arguing in favor of Hagar and Ishmael and sympathizing with Abraham, for "the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son" v. 11 . Although I thought that Abraham should have answered Sarah, telling her that she was cruel, he said nothing to her.
[781]  Rather, God came in and told Abraham, "Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called" v. 12 . The heavenly Judge made the final decision, telling him to do what Sarah requested.
[782]  In the first section of this chapter, we have two seeds, two kinds of persons, and two lives.
[783]  Without the second section, however, we can see neither the source nor the result of their living.
[784]  Praise the Lord that there is another well the well for Isaac vv.
[785]  In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life."
[786]  The well for Isaac was a redeemed well vv.
[787]  e With the Calling on the Name of Jehovah,
[788]  Verse 33, which tells us that Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, also says that he "called there on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God" Heb .
[789]  The God whom Abraham experienced in chapter twenty-one is the same as the One revealed in John 1:1, 4: "In the beginning was the Word..and the Word was God..in Him was life."
[790]  This source of living water makes Isaac a burnt offering 22:2, 9 .
[791]  The source from which Ishmael drank made him an archer, one who lived wildly for himself.
[792]  But Isaac's source of living made him a burnt offering, one who was offered to God for His satisfaction.
[793]  In this message we come to Genesis 22, where we see the climax of Abraham's experience with God.
[794]  Although Abraham must have done many things while he was living in Beer-sheba, the Bible only records that he contended for the well, bought it back at a cost, planted a tamarisk tree, and called on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.
[795]  In the original text of the Bible, there are no chapters, verses, or paragraphs.
[796]  After the mention of Abraham's planting a tamarisk tree and calling on the name of the Lord, God came in to test him v. 1, Heb . God, unlike Satan, never tempts anyone.
[797]  I say again that after Abraham redeemed the well in Beer-sheba, he undoubtedly did many things, but, except for the planting of the tamarisk and calling on the name of the Lord, the Bible does not mention them.
[798]  At such a time the Lord may say, "You have received a gift from and of Me. Now I ask you to return it." We always expect that after having a good time with the Lord He will command us to do something for Him.
[799]  In verse 2 God said to Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
[800]  In his hand Abraham held the fire and the knife.
[801]  After Isaac was offered, he was returned in resurrection for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose vv.
[802]  After we have offered to God what we have received of Him, He will then return it to us in resurrection.
[803]  In obeying God by faith, Abraham acted according to God's revelation vv.
[804]  Everything Abraham did in this chapter was absolutely of God.
[805]  God told Abraham what to do, how to do it, and where to do it.
[806]  As I have already pointed out, Abraham's descendants, the children of Israel, were commanded by God to go three times a year to Mount Moriah to worship God and there to offer to Him their burnt offerings.
[807]  In the last message we saw how Abraham offered his son Isaac according to God's demand.
[808]  That story, recorded in Genesis 22, is not only a meaningful history but also has an implied significance, for it is a vivid picture of Christ in several aspects.
[809]  Although we cannot find the title of Christ nor the name of Jesus in this chapter, many aspects of Christ are signified in the way of implication.
[810]  Isaac was replaced by a ram, that is, by a lamb.
[811]  Verse 13 says, "Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son."
[812]  Here we see that the son was not killed, but the ram, the lamb, was.
[813]  The Lamb of God who replaced the Son of God was our substitute 1 Pet 3:18 .
[814]  As the ram was killed instead of Isaac, so the Lamb of God suffered crucifixion for us.
[815]  When as a boy I heard the preaching of the gospel in which we were told that Christ suffered death on our behalf, I could not understand it fully.
[816]  God's blessing of Abraham eventually issues in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed v. 18; Gal 3:16 . In Galatians 3:16 Paul speaks of only one seed Christ.
[817]  THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF SARAH 9 The Death and Burial of Sarah
[818]  In this message we come to Genesis 23, a chapter which records the death and burial of Sarah.
[819]  When I was young, I did not see why this chapter was included in the book of Genesis.
[820]  I could not understand why, when Abraham must have done many great things which are not recorded, twenty verses were used to describe how he spent his time, energy, money, and even his politeness to acquire a burying place.
[821]  According to the common understanding of most Christians, the main point of this chapter is that Isaac is a type of Christ as the Bridegroom and that Rebekah is a type of the church as the bride.
[822]  Abraham's living was a practical living in oneness with the Lord.
[823]  Abraham did not suddenly have a vision in which God told him that He had a high purpose to carry out on earth, that He needed him, and that Isaac had to be married in order for God's purpose to be fulfilled.
[824]  Abraham did not charge his servant to be faithful, honest, or to do a good work; he charged him with and by the Lord vv.
[825]  Here we see that the atmosphere in which Abraham lived was the Lord Himself.
[826]  Abraham believed in the sovereign Lord, telling his servant that the Lord would send His angel with him and prosper his way v. 40 . Abraham seemed to be saying, "God will send His angel before you.
[827]  The servant knew the Lord's will by looking for His leading in the environment vv.
[828]  According to the King James Version, Ephesians 3:11 speaks of "the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[829]  As Abraham commissioned his servant to reach the chosen bride vv.
[830]  We all can testify that at a certain time the Spirit of God came to us.
[831]  Perhaps you would say, "I didn't realize that God the Spirit came to me.
[832]  The Spirit also brings the riches of Christ to the bride vv.
[833]  Although it was a long journey, he brought her through and presented her to Isaac as his bride.
[834]  After doing what the servant expected, Rebekah received the gifts.
[835]  Firstly, the servant put a golden ring on her nose.
[836]  After receiving and enjoying all these riches, Rebekah followed the servant, traveling through the desert on a camel until she met Isaac vv.
[837]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO HAVING NO MATURITY IN LIFE
[838]  The content of this revelation is God's eternal purpose.
[839]  As we have pointed out many times, God's eternal purpose is to work Himself into a corporate man so that He may have a corporate expression in the universe.
[840]  The record in Genesis 25 is not a record of blessing; rather, it is a record of remarriage.
[841]  4 Buried with Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah
[842]  According to the book of Genesis, the first person to bless others was Melchisedec 14:18-19 .
[843]  For his completion, Abraham also needed Isaac's enjoyment of the inheritance 24:36; 25:5 .
[844]  Firstly, God took away his brother and then his father.
[845]  Later, God rejected Eliezer, commanded Abraham to cast out Ishmael, and told him to offer Isaac on the altar.
[846]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE INHERITING GRACE
[847]  We have pointed out in previous messages that, according to the experience of life, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three parts of one complete person and that we should not consider them as three separate individuals.
[848]  If we know the life in the book of Genesis, we shall see that, in the eyes of God, these three persons are one complete unit in the experience of life.
[849]  We do not see that he was called, lived by faith in God, or lived in fellowship with God.
[850]  In the biblical and experiential sense, grace means enjoyment.
[851]  Our Christian life has three aspects: the aspect of Abraham, the aspect of Isaac, and the aspect of Jacob.
[852]  In the aspect of Abraham we cannot see much enjoyment.
[853]  Although Christ has come and grace has come with Him, and although we have been brought into the grace in which we stand, the greatest frustration to this grace is you and I. Hence, before we can have the experience of Isaac, we need Abraham who represents the first aspect of the experience of life.
[854]  Being called by God, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God are all for the enjoyment of God.
[855]  All this is for one thing the enjoyment of God.
[856]  But grace is just the Triune God wrought into our being to be what we should be and to live, work, and do things for us so that we may say, "I am what I am by the grace of God.
[857]  We all have been taught to have good behavior and to love one another.
[858]  As a result, we try to behave ourselves and to love others.
[859]  But it does not matter whether we can love others or not, for God will never recognize our love.
[860]  Abraham succeeded in bringing forth Ishmael, but God rejected him.
[861]  After Abraham's natural strength and self-effort were dealt with by God, Isaac was born 17:15-19; 18:10-14; 21:1-7 .
[862]  This implies that Isaac was born of grace, which is represented by Sarah Gal 4:24-28, 31 .
[863]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY-FOUR RESTING AND ENJOYING
[864]  We thank the Lord that in the Old Testament He has given us a wonderful and clear picture of the experience of life.
[865]  In the New Testament we have the revelation of the experience of life, but we do not have as clear a picture of it as we have in the Old Testament.
[866]  Although we have spent many years considering the experience of life as revealed in the New Testament, we cannot be certain about it only by the words in the New Testament.
[867]  In the previous message we saw that Isaac inherited grace.
[868]  Although enjoyment is our destiny, we must still take care of the place where we have the enjoyment.
[869]  Let us consider the names of the places where Isaac had enjoyment.
[870]  At Beer-lahai-roi God visits us and reveals Himself to us.
[871]  Here we must see a crucial point, a point about which many Christians are not clear.
[872]  Wherever we are and whether or not we are right or wrong, we have been destined for enjoyment.
[873]  Even when Isaac went downward to Lahai-roi, he still enjoyed a well, the well of the living One who sees us and reveals Himself to us.
[874]  We have seen that Isaac enjoyed all the wells.
[875]  Wherever he went there was a well for his enjoyment.
[876]  This reveals that whether we are right or wrong in our standing there is a well for our satisfaction.
[877]  Isaac received a hundredfold harvest and became great 26:12-14 .
[878]  But God might have said, "Isaac, you are settled here and have gained great riches, but I do not agree with your standing.
[879]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE HAVING NATURAL WEAKNESS AS ABRAHAM
[880]  In the past two messages concerning Isaac, we have seen that he was the heir of grace and that he rested and enjoyed throughout his entire life.
[881]  In our teachings and exhortations, especially to our relatives and children, we say that in order to enjoy the grace of God we must be good, and that if we are not good, we are through with God's grace.
[882]  When do you enjoy grace more when you feel that you are spiritual and good in the eyes of God, or when you are down and feel that you are absolutely unworthy?
[883]  I have enjoyed grace the most when I have been down.
[884]  But we should not say, "Let us be down that we may enjoy grace the most."
[885]  If you try to do this, it will not work.
[886]  After Isaac prayed, God gave him two sons, Esau and Jacob.
[887]  Isaac had some maturity in life, but not very much.
[888]  He had said that his soul would bless, but eventually it was not his soul that blessed; it was his spirit that bestowed the blessing, and his blessing became a prophecy.
[889]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX BEING CHOSEN
[890]  In this message we come to the record of one of the most interesting people in the book of Genesis Jacob.
[891]  Genesis gives us the record of nine great persons.
[892]  However, when we come to the last four Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph we see that, as far as the experience of life is concerned, they should not be considered as four separate individuals.
[893]  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph are a complete unit in the experience of life.
[894]  Although we may stand on the Word of God and say, "I know that I have been chosen because the Bible tells me so," I would still ask this question: how do we know from our experience that we have been chosen by God?
[895]  Jacob was chosen before his birth, even before the foundation of the world 25:22-23; Rom 9:11; Eph 1:4 .
[896]  We, like Jacob, were also chosen before we were born.
[897]  In eternity past, before God began to create anything, He chose us.
[898]  Although we may think that we are quite small, we are big enough for God to pay attention to us.
[899]  God's selection is also of God's mercy Rom 9:14-16 .
[900]  God said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion" Rom 9:15 .
[901]  "It is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy" Rom 9:16 .
[902]  We have been selected and called for God's purpose Rom 9:11 .
[903]  When I was young, I heard message after message and read book after book about Abraham.
[904]  Those messages and books spoke of justification by faith and of Abraham's being the father of faith, but none of them ever said that God called Abraham with a purpose.
[905]  We do not see the beginning of the experience of God in Abraham; neither do we see the adequate ending of the proper life in his experience.
[906]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN BEING DEALT WITH 1
[907]  The book of Genesis contains the biographies of nine great persons: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.
[908]  The longest record is that of Jacob's life, occupying nearly half of the book of Genesis.
[909]  God sovereignly arranged the environment and circumstances pertaining to Jacob's life.
[910]  When Jacob and Esau were in their mother's womb, they fought over who would be born first 25:22-26 .
[911]  But God was very wise and seemed to say, "Jacob, I'll let you have a smart mind, but I will not give you much physical strength.
[912]  Now we must consider God's sovereignty in fulfilling the purpose of His selection.
[913]  By our second birth we all have obtained the birthright that we might express God in His image, represent Him in His dominion, and participate in His kingdom, both in the church today and in the kingdom in the future.
[914]  How we thank the Lord that in the midst of today's degradation He has brought us into the church life, where we are practically in God's kingdom and where we are practicing how to express God and to represent Him.
[915]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT BEING DEALT WITH 2 4 The Dream at Bethel
[916]  In this message we come to a very crucial turn in Jacob's life his dream at Bethel 28:10-22 .
[917]  Although we are all familiar with the story of Jacob's dream, I doubt that we know the true significance of it.
[918]  If we would know the significance of this dream, we must understand why Jacob had it where and when he did.
[919]  Although God had chosen him to be the first, God caused him to be born the second that Jacob might learn that his natural man was altogether unworthy and had to be cut off.
[920]  b Sleeping Homelessly with a Stone as His Pillow
[921]  Speaking of Jacob, Genesis 28:11 says, "He lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of that place, and made it his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep" Heb .
[922]  Jacob was in the wilderness and had no lodging place.
[923]  Needing something on which to rest his head as he slept, he took a stone and made it his pillow.
[924]  But whenever we are deprived of so many man-made things and are brought to the place where there are only the God-created things, that is, when we are cut off from what is of man and put our trust in what is of God, the vision comes.
[925]  Genesis 28:12 says, "And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
[926]  When we come to the New Testament, we see that Christ is the ladder which Jacob saw.
[927]  In John 1:51 Jesus said to Nathanael, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
[928]  Christ is the One who brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven.
[929]  Genesis 28:10-22 is the most crucial word in the revelation of God.
[930]  If we know the Bible, we shall realize that here there is a radical turn, a new start, in the divine revelation.
[931]  The house of God is not merely a place; it is a living composition of living people.
[932]  In Genesis 2 we have a man of clay, and in Genesis 28 we see a man of clay resting upon a stone.
[933]  In no other book do we find a portion such as 28:10-22.
[934]  In verse 13 we see that here Jacob was met by God for the first time.
[935]  Knowing the God of Abraham means that we are justified, and knowing the God of Isaac means that we enjoy the grace of God.
[936]  If we examine our experience, we shall see that whenever we suffered or had some dealing from God, we received the land and had the sense that we were in the kingdom.
[937]  Firstly, after waking out of his sleep, he called that place the house of God v. 17 . Where did Jacob get the concept of the house of God? Abraham did not know of this.
[938]  Jacob also called the place where he met God the gate of heaven v. 17 . Whatever he saw there pointed to heaven.
[939]  It was a place on earth, but it was joined to heaven.
[940]  If I had been Jacob, I would simply have said, "Lord, thank You."
[941]  Although we all are happy in the church life, deep within we have a condition and say, "I will remain in the church life and be a part of the church life as long as God gives me bread."
[942]  When Jacob promised to give the tenth to God, it meant that if God did not give anything to him, then he would not give anything to God.
[943]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY BEING DEALT WITH 4
[944]  As we read Jacob's record in the book of Genesis, we need to remember that the whole Bible is the word of life.
[945]  The Bible contains teachings, stories, prophecies, and types, most of which apparently are unrelated to life.
[946]  But since the whole Bible is the word of God as life, we should not consider the stories in the Bible as mere stories.
[947]  After traveling a very long distance, Jacob came to a certain place, supposing it to be the place where his uncle Laban lived.
[948]  We know that this was God's sovereign arrangement because in 28:15 God promised Jacob, saying, "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."
[949]  If you believe that you are a chosen one of God, then you must believe that whatever happens to you is of God.
[950]  Jacob's record in Genesis 30 and 31 is very interesting.
[951]  Based upon the two principles that the Bible contains no wasted words and that everything in the Bible is the word of life, we must look to the Lord that we might see the life in this record.
[952]  Let us now consider Laban's squeeze 30:25-43; 31:1-16, 38-42 .
[953]  In chapter twenty-nine Laban received Jacob for hospitality 29:14 .
[954]  After a while, Laban might have discovered that Jacob was quite smart and that he could be very profitable to him.
[955]  Furthermore, Jacob said to him, "Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty" 31:42 .
[956]  Although Jacob was squeezed and threatened by Laban, he could still play tricks on him 30:31-43 .
[957]  One day Jacob told Laban that he wanted to go back to his own country and that Laban should give him his wives and his children for whom he had served so many years 30:25-26 .
[958]  Laban answered, "I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake" 30:27 .
[959]  Through His blessing, God preserved Jacob from Laban's squeeze 31:7-12, 16, 42 .
[960]  We must bow down, worship God, and learn the lesson not to care for how much we are squeezed by others.
[961]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO BEING DEALT WITH 6 11 The Stone with Oil Poured upon It
[962]  Jacob's dream is the most crucial point in the whole book of Genesis 28:10-22 .
[963]  As we have pointed out elsewhere, in the Bible a stone is mainly for God's building.
[964]  When Peter first came to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas John 1:42 , saying, "You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas which translated means a stone ."
[965]  Approximately three years later, the Lord questioned His disciples, saying, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"
[966]  After Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord Jesus said to him, "I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church" Matt 16, 18 .
[967]  In Genesis 28, Jacob was in a homeless and restless situation v. 10 . When man is homeless, God also is homeless Isa 66:1 . Thus, in Genesis 28, both Jacob and God were homeless.
[968]  In like manner, when man is thirsty, God also is thirsty, and when man is unsatisfied, God also is unsatisfied.
[969]  When the Lord Jesus came to the well of Sychar John 4 , He was thirsty, and a thirsty woman came to Him.
[970]  Many Christians talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[971]  What an experience of oil we have had since we came into the church life and our pillow stood up to become a pillar!
[972]  All Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 and the whole Bible is a book of life.
[973]  Do you truly believe that Genesis 31, the chapter which we shall consider in this message, is the breath of God?
[974]  When I was young, I thought that surely every word and phrase in Ephesians was inspired by God, but I did not appreciate Genesis 31 as much as I did Ephesians.
[975]  The significance of that dream was that it revealed how God was desirous to have a house on earth and that His intention was to make His called one a stone, the material for His building.
[976]  As Laban was pursuing the departed Jacob, God spoke to him in a dream the night before he overtook Jacob, saying, "Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob from good to bad" v. 24, Heb . Laban was more subtle than Jacob, but this time God forced him to be honest.
[977]  Laban even told Jacob of what God had spoken to him, saying, "It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your fathers spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob from good to bad" v. 29, Heb . If I had been Laban, I would have never told Jacob of this.
[978]  Before chapter thirty-two, there is no record that Jacob prayed.
[979]  In 32:3-4 Jacob sent messengers to Esau, commanding them to address Esau as his lord.
[980]  The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him" 32:6 .
[981]  When Jacob heard this news, he was afraid and prayed about it to the Lord.
[982]  His cousins envied him v. 1 , and his uncle's countenance changed toward him v. 2 . This change was for Jacob's benefit.
[983]  In this chapter, Jacob was in the middle of the process of transformation.
[984]  At that juncture, God intervened and said to Jacob, "Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee" v. 3 . If Jacob had been a completely transformed person, he would have immediately praised the Lord and told the Lord that he was trusting Him for His clear guidance.
[985]  All the changes in Jacob's environment were indicators that he should go back home.
[986]  Jacob did go, but not in a noble way.
[987]  Do you think that Jacob fled from Laban in a proper way?
[988]  As we have seen, Laban pursued Jacob and overtook him vv.
[989]  Laban had the power to hurt Jacob, but God warned him in a dream not to do anything to him v. 24 . Although Laban could not do anything, he did what all human beings do he complained.
[990]  Genesis 32 and 33 contain a very strange experience in the life of Jacob, the chosen one.
[991]  We have already pointed out that Jacob did not trust in the Lord.
[992]  In chapter thirty-one he fled from Laban, and God delivered him out of Laban's usurping hand.
[993]  Because Laban told him that God had warned him not to hurt Jacob, Jacob took the opportunity to boldly rebuke him 31:24, 36 .
[994]  Although we can only guess at what Jacob was thinking when he did this perhaps he thought that each of the two camps of his household would be protected by the two camps of the angels , one thing is clear Jacob did not exercise trust in God nor in the vision of the angels; rather, he expended his time and energy in exercising his natural ability.
[995]  After making these arrangements, Jacob probably was still not at peace.
[996]  Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good" v. 9, Heb . Here we see that Jacob prayed by holding on to the Lord's word.
[997]  After praying such a marvelous prayer, Jacob surely should have been at peace.
[998]  Instead of sleeping, he "took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother" v. 13 . He divided this present into nine droves "and delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove" v. 16 . The purpose of this was to see what Esau's attitude toward Jacob would be.
[999]  After all this, when Jacob saw Esau, he was bold, yet humble, to go to the front to meet him 33:3-4 .
[1000]  Verse 3 says, "And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
[1001]  If he had truly known God and had trusted in Him, he would have been continually at peace, saying, "I am not worried about Esau because God has promised to bring me back to my father's land.
[1002]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-FIVE BEING BROKEN c.
[1003]  Genesis 32:22-32 relates a crucial experience in the life of Jacob, God's chosen one.
[1004]  The Lord in the form of man wrestled with Jacob "until the breaking of the day" v. 24 . The Lord God would never wrestle with a stranger or with an unbelieving sinner.
[1005]  In this portion of the Word, we do not have an appearing of the God of glory; neither do we have a visitation from the Lord.
[1006]  To Abraham, the Lord firstly appeared as the God of glory Acts 7:2 .
[1007]  Later, in Genesis 18, the Lord visited him and shared a meal with him.
[1008]  But this experience of Jacob's was neither an appearance of God nor a visitation from the Lord; it was a dealing.
[1009]  When you were saved, the Lord appeared to you, and many times after that you have had sweet and pleasant visitations of the Lord.
[1010]  Eventually, we realize that it is not a matter of our husband, our wife, or of one of the elders; it is God who is here dealing with us.
[1011]  At a certain point during this night of wrestling, the Lord touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh.
[1012]  Verse 25 says, "And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
[1013]  Realizing that this wrestler was greater than he, Jacob asked him to bless him v. 26 . I doubt that even at this time Jacob realized that this wrestler was God.
[1014]  After touching him, the wrestler said to Jacob, "Let me go, for the day breaketh" v. 26 . But then Jacob said, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me" Heb . After Jacob said this, the Lord asked Jacob what his name was v. 27 . Since the Lord already knew Jacob's name, why did He ask him this question? It was to cause Jacob to realize who he was and to force him to admit that he was Jacob, the supplanter.
[1015]  After Jacob divulged his name, the wrestler said, "Thy name shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel; for thou has wrestled with God and with men, and hast prevailed" v. 28, Heb . The name Israel means "wrestler with God." Many Christians know that Israel means "the Prince of God," but, as the best lexicons and translations make clear, this meaning is secondary.
[1016]  After Jacob heard that his name had been changed to Israel, a wrestler with God, he immediately realized that this wrestler was God.
[1017]  We in the churches in the Lord's recovery are God's chosen ones.
[1018]  We are in His hand, we are on His way, and I am fully assured that we are also under His dealing.
[1019]  Whether or not you realize it, recognize it, or admit it, the fact is that you are under the Lord's dealing.
[1020]  Sooner or later, you will have the sense that you have been touched by Him.
[1021]  When that time comes, you will know that you are limp and that you will never be the same.
[1022]  Many of us can testify that since the day we first loved the Lord, especially since we came into the church life and began to follow the Lord in His recovery, we found ourselves in circumstances where we were being dealt with.
[1023]  Among the thousands of people in the church life, there are many different kinds: the clever, the wise, the crafty, the proud, the arrogant.
[1024]  According to religion, the correct way is to change our outward behavior.
[1025]  But God's way, the way of life, is different.
[1026]  God did not say to Jacob, "Jacob, I have wrestled with you, touched you, changed your name, and given you My blessing.
[1027]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-SIX AFTER BREAKING
[1028]  Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed.
[1029]  Do you believe that Genesis 34, the chapter which we shall consider in this message, is God-breathed?
[1030]  We need to look to the Lord that He would show us how this portion of the Word is the breath of God.
[1031]  When I was young, after I had read chapters like Genesis 34 once or twice and the story had been fixed in my memory, I skipped over them.
[1032]  Whenever I came to this chapter in my reading of the Old Testament, I would remember that Jacob's daughter was defiled and that his sons mercilessly killed people and plundered the city, and I passed over it.
[1033]  After he had been delivered out of all these troubles, "Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle" 33:17 .
[1034]  Succoth was on the east side of the Jordan.
[1035]  This indicates that while Jacob was at Succoth, he had not yet crossed the Jordan River to enter into the heart of the land of Canaan.
[1036]  The land of Canaan is not mentioned until the next verse, where we are told that Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, "which is in the land of Canaan" v. 18 . In God's eyes, when Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house there, he had not yet come back to the heart of the good land.
[1037]  At Bethel, Jacob made a vow to God, promising that the stone would be the house of God.
[1038]  Although what Jacob had at Shechem was good, he still needed the dealing in his circumstances 34:1-31 because he had not yet come back to Bethel.
[1039]  In Exodus 32 the slaughtering hand of Levi became a blessing.
[1040]  When the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, Moses said, "Who is on the Lord's side?
[1041]  Let him come unto me," and "all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him" Exo 32:26 .
[1042]  Then, when Moses said, "Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
[1043]  Do not simply regard this as a story about Jacob.
[1044]  I can testify that I have done the same thing as Jacob.
[1045]  We made a vow, saying, "O Lord, if You will bring me through these difficulties safely, I will consecrate myself to You and take You as my God and build a house in this place for You."
[1046]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-SEVEN A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF GOD'S BUILDING
[1047]  The book of Revelation is the consummation of the Bible.
[1048]  If we did not have this book, the Bible would lack a proper conclusion.
[1049]  Of all the gospel messages delivered today, hardly one is concerned with God's building.
[1050]  Because we are still under the influence of Christianity, we simply do not have the impression that God's redemption in Christ is for the building.
[1051]  If you stood up in a meeting of Christians and praised Christ by saying, "Worthy is the stone," they would think that you were crazy, or that you had taken in a peculiar concept.
[1052]  Ultimately, the New Jerusalem will be the eternal Bethel.
[1053]  The book of Revelation says that the New Jerusalem is God's tabernacle and that there God Himself and the Lamb are the temple Rev 21:22 .
[1054]  After uttering this prophecy, Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house" 28:20-22 .
[1055]  All these main points in the Old Testament are merely types.
[1056]  This matter of God's building is of great significance.
[1057]  In the next message we shall see what Jacob did after God told him to arise and go up to Bethel.
[1058]  The Bible begins with God's creation and ends with God's habitation.
[1059]  We all need to be impressed with these two words creation and habitation.
[1060]  If we would know the Bible, we must keep these two things, God's creation and His habitation, firmly in mind.
[1061]  At the time of chapter thirty-five, Jacob must have been approximately a hundred years of age.
[1062]  Although Jacob had passed through many things, prior to this chapter, we are not told that he had ever made a thorough clearance.
[1063]  He suffered many things in relation to his brother, his uncle, and his cousins, suffering twenty years under the hand of his uncle Laban.
[1064]  But Genesis never says that as Jacob was undergoing those sufferings he purified himself or made a clearance of himself.
[1065]  The first time God appeared to Jacob was in a dream 28:10-22 in which Jacob saw heaven opened and a ladder extending from earth to heaven with angels ascending and descending upon it.
[1066]  Rather, because Jacob's heart had been touched and, as a result, he was ready to hear the word of God, God simply said, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother" 35:1 .
[1067]  In this chapter God did not say, "Jacob, you are going to Bethel to build an altar there; you should realize that you must be holy.
[1068]  Firstly, Jacob told his household and all that were with him to put away the foreign gods that were among them 35:2 .
[1069]  We must not only put away the foreign gods, but also purify our whole being.
[1070]  In addition to putting away the foreign gods and purifying themselves, they changed their garments 35:2 .
[1071]  According to the Bible, to change garments means to change your manner of life.
[1072]  Ephesians 4:22-24 reveals that the old manner of life was the life of the fallen humanity and that the new manner of life is of the church.
[1073]  Verse 5 says, "And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
[1074]  It is very encouraging to see that their enemies were terrified.
[1075]  Due to the trouble caused by his sons, Jacob was afraid that the city people would fight against him and kill him.
[1076]  But after Jacob and all those with him had put away the idols, purified themselves, and changed their garments, a terror from God fell upon the city people.
[1077]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-NINE BEING TRANSFORMED 2
[1078]  If we observe this principle, whenever we come to certain points in this book, we shall recognize that they are developed in the following books of the Bible.
[1079]  If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that the house of God was first mentioned in this chapter.
[1080]  In this message we need to consider Jacob's experience at Bethel 35:6-7, 9-15 .
[1081]  As we saw in the last message, Jacob reacted to God's charge to arise and go up to Bethel by having a thorough clearance.
[1082]  But when Jacob acted on the word of God, arising, going up to Bethel, dwelling there, and building an altar to God, he built an altar according to God's desires, not according to his own intention.
[1083]  After the altar was built, God appeared to Jacob again v. 9 . Jacob's experience was somewhat different from Abraham's. When God first appeared to Abraham, there was no altar.
[1084]  But God appeared to Jacob, not only at Bethel, but in front of the altar.
[1085]  Before we came into the church life, we did have some experience of God's appearing.
[1086]  When God appeared to Jacob in Bethel, He blessed him v. 9 . What blessing we have received since coming to Bethel and building an altar! When I was young, I liked the hymn that says, "Count your blessings, name them one by one." I encourage you to count your blessings, making a list of all the blessings you have experienced in the church life.
[1087]  In His appearing to Jacob at Bethel, God also reminded him of his new name, saying, "Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel" v. 10 . God seemed to be saying, "Jacob, didn't I change your name? Why then do you still call yourself Jacob? Now I remind you that your name is no longer Jacob and that you must call yourself Israel.
[1088]  e God Promising Jacob 1 To Be Fruitful and Multiply
[1089]  All of us in the church life, including the least and the youngest, need to believe this promise and claim its fulfillment, saying, "Lord, I do not agree with being a solitary believer.
[1090]  Verse 14 says that "Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had talked with him, even a pillar of stone."
[1091]  The first thing that Jacob did in reacting to God's word was to repeat what he had done in Bethel the first time to set up a pillar of stone.
[1092]  Nothing in our first dream that was truly of the Lord can ever be forgotten.
[1093]  Often in the Lord's table meeting I have realized that a number of saints have experienced Christ to such a degree that when they offered Christ to God at the Lord's table, there was the indication in their prayer and praise that they were ready to pour themselves out upon Christ to God.
[1094]  As we have pointed out in chapter twenty-eight, pouring oil upon the pillar signifies the outpouring of the Spirit of God upon God's chosen people for the building of God's house.
[1095]  But here the pouring of the oil upon the pillar follows the pouring out of the drink offering upon the pillar.
[1096]  The more we pour out ourselves with Christ as an offering to God for His house, the more the outpouring of the Spirit of God will be brought in. The building of God's house needs this.
[1097]  The longer we remain in the church and the more we experience Christ in the church, the more we shall be assured that this is Bethel, and the more bold we shall be to say, "This is the church and I am in it."
[1098]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY BEING TRANSFORMED 3 5 The Experience at Bethel
[1099]  We have seen that many crucial seeds of the truth are sown in the book of Genesis.
[1100]  Undoubtedly, many know that, according to the New Testament, the house of God denotes the church 1 Tim 3:15 .
[1101]  Probably all of you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord.
[1102]  But where was that consecration at Shechem or at Bethel?
[1103]  Jacob also experienced a progressive advancement in the matter of God's appearing.
[1104]  God appeared to him in a dream in chapter twenty-eight, but that appearing was not substantial.
[1105]  If anyone would leave the church life after remaining in it for a time, he could never deny that while he was in the church life he had experienced the appearing of God in a solid way.
[1106]  There, God blessed Jacob, saying, "I am God, all-sufficient: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land" vv.
[1107]  The God who gives the promise in chapter thirty-five is God all-sufficient v. 11, Heb . We need to give attention to the revelation of God's titles in the book of Genesis.
[1108]  In chapter one, God is only revealed as Elohim, and in chapter two we see the title Jehovah rendered Lord in the King James Version .
[1109]  God's promise to Abraham is repeated in His promise to Jacob.
[1110]  God's promise to Jacob in chapter twenty-eight was indefinite.
[1111]  If I had been Jacob, I would have said, "Lord, I don't want my descendants to be dust.
[1112]  The promise in 35:11, given by the all-sufficient God, is mainly for us to be fruitful and multiply.
[1113]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY-TWO BEING TRANSFORMED 5 f Jacob's Doing 1 Building a Pillar
[1114]  In this message we shall still dwell on the experience at Bethel.
[1115]  In 35:14, at Bethel Jacob eventually set up a pillar of stone as he did after having the dream when he was at Bethel the first time 28:18 .
[1116]  If Jacob had not called this pillar the house of God, we would never realize that the pillar of stone was for the building of God's house.
[1117]  This tabernacle, which was erected that God might dwell among men, was a precursor of the temple.
[1118]  Now we need to consider how to become a pillar.
[1119]  If you would know how to be a pillar, you must consider five different places: the place of Lot's wife, who became a pillar of salt; the place where Jacob set up the pillar at Bethel; the place of Solomon, where he built the two pillars; the place of Peter, James, and John, who were pillars of the New Testament church; and the place of the church in Philadelphia, where we see that whosoever will may be a pillar.
[1120]  According to my experience, this indicates that we all come into the church twice.
[1121]  In 1925, I had a clear dream, but it was not until seven years later, in 1932, that I came into the actuality and practicality of the church life.
[1122]  How can you tell that someone has become a pillar?
[1123]  In the church life we realize that if certain brothers are taken away, everything collapses, but if they are present, they are pillars supporting the whole building.
[1124]  Based upon the principle that nearly everything in the book of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible, we come to 1 Kings 7:13-22, a strong portion in the Word regarding the pillars.
[1125]  Now we come to a crucial point the two pillars were made of brass 1 Kings 7:15 .
[1126]  In Genesis the pillar is a pillar of stone, but in 1 Kings 7 the pillars are pillars of brass.
[1127]  On the top of each of the pillars was a capital five cubits in height 1 Kings 7:16 .
[1128]  In order to bear the responsibility in this complicated situation, we must live by faith in God.
[1129]  The lily signifies a life of faith in God.
[1130]  Then we must live by faith in God, not by what we are or by what we can do.
[1131]  Verse 20 says, "And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital" Heb .
[1132]  In this message we shall again devote our attention to the two pillars at the temple.
[1133]  We have seen that when Jacob was first at Bethel, he set up as a pillar the stone he had used for a pillow and called it the house of God 28:18, 22 .
[1134]  The full development of the seed of the pillar is in Revelation 3:12, where the Lord Jesus says, "He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God."
[1135]  God, His Word, and His dealing with us are not simple.
[1136]  Although we may have problems in the church life, in our work, and at home, we also have the life of the lily, which, in the Bible, signifies a life lived by trusting in God.
[1137]  The Network and the Chainwork on the Two Capitals
[1138]  Let us now see the constituent, or the constitution, of a Hiram.
[1139]  No one can tell whether Dan here refers to the tribe of Dan or to the city of Dan Nonetheless, it is certain that it refers to people from Dan, for the city of Dan was also of the people of the tribe of Dan Hiram's father was a Tyrian, a man of Tyre, a pagan country.
[1140]  Hiram's father was a Tyrian, a man of Tyre 1 Kings 7:14 .
[1141]  According to the Hebrew text of 1 Kings 7:14, we are also told that Hiram was of the tribe of Naphtali.
[1142]  Habakkuk 3:17 and 18 say, "Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vine; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and I will joy in the God of my salvation" Heb .
[1143]  I do not know who Paul's mother was, but, spiritually speaking, I am certain that she was a "daughter of Dan," a daughter of the tribe of the serpent.
[1144]  Do not use the three weekly life-study messages as an excuse.
[1145]  You must both study earnestly and read the life-study messages.
[1146]  Otherwise, I would have no trust in you because the Lord would put no trust in you.
[1147]  But after you gain your "Tyrian" education, you must put your "Tyrian" father in a coffin and bury him, so that your "Danite" mother becomes a widow.
[1148]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY-SIX THE BUILDER OF THE PILLARS
[1149]  However, when we probe into the depths of the revelation of the Bible, we must worship God.
[1150]  Young people, if you take this word, after a number of years you will be able to say, "Lord, I thank You for that word about the 'Tyrian' father and 'Danite' mother.
[1151]  Not only did he set up a pillar, but he called it "the house of God."
[1152]  As we have pointed out again and again, nearly every item in the book of Genesis is a seed of a truth developed in the following books of the Bible.
[1153]  In the New Testament we are also told that the whole church is the pillar.
[1154]  First Timothy 3:15 says, "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."
[1155]  Now we must go on to the pillars in the New Jerusalem.
[1156]  If we do this, we shall be overcomers, and the Lord will write upon us the name of His God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and His new name.
[1157]  In Revelation 3:12 the Lord said that He would write upon the overcomer "the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name."
[1158]  To say, "My God," indicates that we do not act on our own; it indicates that we are doing the will of God.
[1159]  In this message we need to consider how we can be perfected as pillars for the Lord's move.
[1160]  One day Brother Nee told me that he and the other co-workers were burdened that I move to Shanghai with my family to stay with them and work with them.
[1161]  He asked me to bring this matter to the Lord.
[1162]  As I took the matter to the Lord and prayed about it, the Lord showed me from the book of Acts that in His move on earth there is only one flow.
[1163]  Let me now tell you the secret to being solidly perfected to be a strong pillar for the Lord's move.
[1164]  The Lord is still working and moving to accomplish something on earth.
[1165]  In order for Him to fulfill His purpose there must be a flow.
[1166]  He built an altar, set up a pillar, poured a drink offering upon the pillar, and then poured oil upon the pillar 35:7, 14-15 .
[1167]  Although all the offerings are types of Christ and are for our experience, there is a difference between the basic offerings and the drink offering.
[1168]  The sin offering, one of the basic offerings, was a type of Christ for the experience of sinners.
[1169]  The most regulated place on earth is a cemetery.
[1170]  There was no mention of the drink offering in connection with the five basic offerings in Leviticus 1 through 7 because at that time the offerers had no experience of Christ.
[1171]  They were like Jacob at Bethel the first time.
[1172]  But after they had entered into the good land, had experienced Christ, and had gained something to offer God, they were required to offer the drink offering to match their other offerings.
[1173]  In Exodus 29 is the consecration of the priesthood.
[1174]  In verses 38 through 42 we are told that the priests had to offer the daily continual burnt offering with the drink offering.
[1175]  Genesis 35:14 also tells us that Jacob poured oil upon the pillar.
[1176]  He did this after he had poured the drink offering upon it.
[1177]  I used to think that Jacob was mistaken in doing this and that he should have poured the oil first.
[1178]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY BEING TRANSFORMED 10
[1179]  After remaining in Bethel for quite a long time, Jacob journeyed on from there 35:16 .
[1180]  Apparently, this journey away from Bethel was not a positive move.
[1181]  But Jacob's leaving Bethel does not mean that he left the house of God; it means that he was going on in his spiritual experience.
[1182]  1 Bringing in Christ as the Son of Sorrow Benoni
[1183]  and as the Son of the Right Hand Benjamin
[1184]  Verse 18 says, "And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, for she died, that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."
[1185]  Jacob had twelve sons: six, including Levi with the priesthood and Judah with the kingship, were born of Leah; two, Joseph and Benjamin, were born of Rachel; two, Dan, the worst, and Naphtali, one of the best, were born of Bilhah; and two others, Gad and Asher, were born of Zilpah vv.
[1186]  God has ordained us to have our natural choice, but not according to our way and our time.
[1187]  You may wonder why God bothers us like this.
[1188]  His one purpose in doing it is to bring forth Christ.
[1189]  God has ordained you to have a wife, but He will not allow you to have her in your way and at your time.
[1190]  The loss of Rachel was not the only painful thing that happened to Jacob as he journeyed from Bethel.
[1191]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-ONE THE THREE PILLARS AND THE ONE TOWER
[1192]  As we trace the history of Jacob, we see that in his life there were three pillars and one tower.
[1193]  Although Jacob set up pillars four times, he erected them in just three places at Gilead, at Bethel, and on the way to Bethlehem 31:45; 28:18, 22; 35:14, 20 .
[1194]  Because Jacob set up pillars in three places, twice setting up a pillar at Bethel, there were actually three pillars in his life as landmarks of his experience.
[1195]  Years before Jacob set up this pillar at Gilead, he had set up a pillar at Bethel 28:18, 22 .
[1196]  Not long after we were saved, we heard something about the house of God and we responded to what we heard.
[1197]  After that dream, he had a real experience, not of the house of God, but of the care of God.
[1198]  At Bethel Jacob built an altar and set up a pillar.
[1199]  Not only did he answer God's call; he also consecrated himself to God for the fulfillment of His desire to have Bethel.
[1200]  The death of Rachel signifies the death of our natural choice.
[1201]  The first two pillars we set up are not for us to have a happy life they are for us to exist to build the house of God for the expression of Christ.
[1202]  Although Jacob had eleven sons, not one of them was a complete type of Christ.
[1203]  When Jacob first met Rachel and fell in love with her, he did not know what trouble she would cause him.
[1204]  It was because Jacob loved Rachel that he was given Leah and the two maids, Zilpah and Bilhah.
[1205]  Without Leah and these two maids, he would not have had their ten sons to cause him problems.
[1206]  After Jacob set up the third pillar, he "journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder" 35:21 .
[1207]  In this message we come to the most pleasant section of the book of Genesis, chapters thirty-seven through fifty.
[1208]  The record of all the generations included in this book is a portrait of God's divine economy.
[1209]  In Adam we do not see much of God's expression and dominion.
[1210]  Although Abel believed in God, we do not clearly see in him God's expression and dominion.
[1211]  Enosh realized that he was fragile and weak, and he began to call on the name of the Lord.
[1212]  In chapter thirty-seven Jacob was an old man.
[1213]  1 Jacob Being Robbed of the Treasure of His Heart
[1214]  In order to become mature, Jacob firstly had to suffer the loss of Joseph, the treasure of his heart.
[1215]  d Joseph Having Two Dreams that Caused His Brothers
[1216]  Joseph had two dreams that caused his brothers to hate him even more vv.
[1217]  Joseph's brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem v. 12 . Shepherding was their means of making a living.
[1218]  Through this livelihood of theirs they sovereignly had the opportunity to put Joseph away from Jacob.
[1219]  Through God's sovereignty, which was exercised in all these seemingly coincidental matters, Jacob lost the treasure of his heart vv.
[1220]  Before we consider further Jacob's dealings at Hebron, we need to point out the difference between transformation and maturity.
[1221]  Suddenly, beyond Jacob's control, he was struck with famine, for "the famine was in the land of Canaan" 42:5 .
[1222]  We have seen that in the twenty years between the loss of Joseph and the coming of this famine, Jacob had nothing to do.
[1223]  He probably felt that his life was over and that he was waiting to go to his people, that is, to die.
[1224]  When Jacob's sons returned from Egypt with the grain, Jacob learned that Simeon had been detained in Egypt 42:24, 36 .
[1225]  When one of them discovered that his money had been put in the mouth of his sack, he told his brothers about it, "and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
[1226]  God sovereignly did not allow the good news about Joseph to reach Jacob at an early date.
[1227]  As Joseph and his brothers were happy together in Egypt, Jacob was suffering in Canaan, waiting for his sons to return.
[1228]  The longer Jacob's sons remained in Egypt, the more he suffered.
[1229]  But the more Jacob suffered, the better it was for him.
[1230]  This was under the sovereign hand of God to prolong Jacob's suffering that he might be emptied of everything.
[1231]  Like Jacob, after we have been changed, God will sovereignly use persons, things, and events to empty us of everything that has filled us and to take away every preoccupation so that we may have an increased capacity to be filled with God.
[1232]  In the last message we pointed out the difference between transformation and maturity.
[1233]  2 Manifestation of Maturity a No Blame at Hearing That Joseph Was Still Alive
[1234]  The first sign of Jacob's maturity is the fact that he did not blame his sons when he heard the news about Joseph's being alive in Egypt 45:21-28 .
[1235]  Although they had conspired to kill Joseph, eventually sold him into slavery, and lied to their father about him, Jacob did not blame them.
[1236]  If he had not been mature, he would have said, "What have you done to me?
[1237]  Genesis 46:1 says, "And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."
[1238]  After Jacob arrived in Egypt, he did not beg for anything.
[1239]  However, when he was young, he begged wherever he went.
[1240]  When Jacob went to Egypt, he did not engage in any activity for himself.
[1241]  As Jacob was about to bless the two sons of Joseph, he spoke of God as the One who had shepherded him all his life long 48:15-16, Heb .
[1242]  In these verses Jacob said, "God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which shepherded me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed me from evil, bless the lads."
[1243]  Here we see a threefold mention of God: the God before whom Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who shepherded Jacob his whole life long, and the Angel who delivered him from evil.
[1244]  In this message, another parenthesis in our life-study, we shall consider the seed of blessing sown in Genesis and its development in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[1245]  The first case of blessing in the Bible is Melchisedec's blessing of Abraham 14:18-20 .
[1246]  In 2 Corinthians 13:14 the Apostle Paul also gives a pattern of blessing.
[1247]  This verse says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
[1248]  We have seen that a priest brings people to God.
[1249]  An apostle, however, brings God to people; he comes to people with God.
[1250]  According to the Old Testament pattern of the blessing by the priest and the New Testament pattern of blessing by the Apostle, the proper blessing is to bring people into the presence of God and to bring God into them as grace, love, and fellowship that they may enjoy the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[1251]  In the church life, the Lord will raise up many we do not like, and some of them will become the best elders.
[1252]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-SIX THE SHIFTINGS OF THE BIRTHRIGHT
[1253]  In this message, a parenthesis in our life-study, we shall consider another one of these seeds the seed of the shifting of the birthright.
[1254]  In 25:22-26, 29-34 we see the shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob.
[1255]  Although Esau was the firstborn v. 25 , Jacob was predestinated to have the birthright v. 23 . The shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob reveals that receiving the birthright is a matter of predestination.
[1256]  Although you may be an Esau by birth, this does not mean that you are predestinated to have the birthright.
[1257]  As we consider the five cases of the shifting of the birthright, we must worship God for His sovereignty and say, "O Lord, we thank You for Your sovereignty.
[1258]  Manasseh was the firstborn v. 14 . When Joseph brought Ephraim and Manasseh to Jacob to be blessed by him, he tried to maneuver the blessing of the birthright according to the natural birth vv.
[1259]  THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY 2 g Prophesying with Blessing
[1260]  Although we are familiar with what it means to prophesy, we may not be familiar with prophesying with blessing.
[1261]  In chapter twenty-seven Jacob spoke in a deceitful way to Isaac, his father vv.
[1262]  In 27:19 Jacob lied to his father, saying, "I am Esau thy firstborn."
[1263]  When Isaac asked how he had found the venison so quickly, Jacob said, "Because the Lord thy God brought it to me."
[1264]  Then Isaac said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau" v. 22 , and he asked, "Art thou my very son Esau?" v. 24 . To this, Jacob replied, "I am." Thus, Jacob's speaking in chapter twenty-seven was absolute falsehood.
[1265]  In order to prophesy with blessing, we must fulfill four requirements.
[1266]  The first requirement is to know God, the desire of God's heart, and the purpose of God.
[1267]  In order to speak such a word, we must know God, we must know God's heart, and we must know God's purpose.
[1268]  Due to the influence of today's Christianity, many think that only prophets can prophesy.
[1269]  But where is the verse saying that Jacob was a prophet?
[1270]  Jacob was not a gifted prophet predicting the things to come, but he still prophesied.
[1271]  In 49:1 Jacob said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days."
[1272]  At the end of verse 40 Paul said, "But I think that I also have the Spirit of God."
[1273]  The little word "also" here means a great deal.
[1274]  Paul seemed to be saying, "I not only have my opinion; I also have the Spirit of God."
[1275]  Although he did not have the assurance that he had the Spirit of God, we all recognize chapter seven of 1 Corinthians as the word of God.
[1276]  At the time of chapter forty-nine, Jacob was a God-man, a man filled, constituted, permeated, and even reorganized with God.
[1277]  In the previous message we pointed out that although this word of prophecy was spoken by a man, it was nonetheless the word of God.
[1278]  Before we examine the significant aspects of Jacob's prophecy regarding Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, I wish to point out that according to Jacob's prophecy with blessing, it is possible for our natural status and disposition to be changed.
[1279]  But do not be proud of your goodness, for you may become bad.
[1280]  If you were born bad, you should not be disappointed.
[1281]  5 Concerning Reuben a Being the Firstborn to Have the Preeminence
[1282]  In Deuteronomy 33:6 Moses uttered a prophecy regarding Reuben.
[1283]  This prophecy, a judgment according to the law, was spoken through an experienced, sympathetic old man.
[1284]  Simeon was omitted from Moses' blessing recorded in Deuteronomy.
[1285]  It is not an insignificant matter to be omitted from the record of God.
[1286]  In 49:7 Jacob said that Levi should be scattered among the children of Israel.
[1287]  In this message we come to 49:8-15, the most difficult section of this chapter.
[1288]  As we consider these verses, we need to be impressed with the fact that in the first group, composed of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, Christ has not yet come.
[1289]  We do not see Christ in Reuben, in Simeon, or in Levi.
[1290]  What we see in Levi is his absoluteness, his desperation, and his faithfulness.
[1291]  Verse 8 says, "Judah, thy brethren shall praise thee: thy hand shall be upon the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee" Heb .
[1292]  Here we are told that Judah's brothers will praise him and that his father's children will bow down before him.
[1293]  Verse 10 says, "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be" Heb .
[1294]  The scepter here denotes the scepter of the kingship or of the kingdom.
[1295]  Verse 11 says, "Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes."
[1296]  8 Concerning Zebulun and Issachar a Zebulun Being at the Haven of the Sea
[1297]  After Judah, Zebulun comes in. Verse 13 says, "Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon." This verse says Zebulun is a haven for ships.
[1298]  The method of transportation here has been changed from asses to ships.
[1299]  Christ's victory brings in the kingdom v. 10 . Even on earth today, wherever there is a victory, there is also a kingdom.
[1300]  Verse 10 says that the scepter will not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from between his feet until Shiloh comes.
[1301]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWO BEING MATURED
[1302]  In this message we come to the third group of Jacob's twelve sons.
[1303]  As we have seen clearly, the prophecy with blessing in Genesis 49 portrays not only the lives of the twelve tribes of Israel in the Old Testament, but also the spiritual life of Christians in the New Testament.
[1304]  9 Concerning Dan a A Young Lion Fighting for More Land
[1305]  Deuteronomy 33:22 says, "And of Dan he said, Dan is a young lion: he shall leap from Bashan" Heb .
[1306]  The mention of the young lion in this verse links the second and third groups of the twelve sons, showing that the third group is the continuation of the second.
[1307]  At this point Jacob said, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord" v. 18 . After speaking about Dan as a serpent by the way and a horned snake on the path that bites the horse's heels, Jacob cried to the Lord for salvation.
[1308]  If we see the situation of today's Dans, we also will cry "O Lord, save us.
[1309]  Jacob prophesied that Dan would judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel v. 16 . This prophecy with blessing indicates that Jacob was concerned that Dan would be cut off.
[1310]  10 Concerning Gad a Raided by a Raiding Band and Raiding Their Heels
[1311]  Because of the failure of Dan, Jacob called on the Lord for His salvation.
[1312]  d Providing the First Part of the Good Land for Himself
[1313]  Deuteronomy 33:21 says of Gad, "He provided the first part for himself, for there a portion of the lawgiver was reserved" Heb .
[1314]  Victory always gives us enlargement, which is the expansion of space.
[1315]  11 Concerning Asher a Rich Food and Royal Dainties
[1316]  When we have the victory of Christ and help our brothers gain their portion before we enjoy our own, we have rich food.
[1317]  Genesis 49:21 says, "Naphtali is a hind let loose."
[1318]  Immediately after Asher comes Naphtali, who is neither a young lion nor a lioness, but a hind.
[1319]  According to the Hebrew text, the title of Psalm 22 speaks of the hind of the morning, indicating that the resurrected Christ in Psalm 22 is a hind let loose.
[1320]  With Naphtali we have not only the victorious Christ as a lion, but the resurrected Christ as a released hind skipping on the mountaintops.
[1321]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THREE THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DAN,
[1322]  I. THE APOSTASY OF DAN A. Gaining More Christ by His Victorious Life
[1323]  Dan was the continuation of Judah, for Judah was a lion and Dan was a young lion.
[1324]  As the continuation of Judah, Dan was successful in gaining more Christ by his victorious life Deut 33:22; Josh 19:47; Judg.
[1325]  Like the children of Israel, all Christians should be one, and the worship of God should have only one center.
[1326]  But the Danites could use the convenient location of their worship center to persuade their neighbors to meet with them for the worship of God.
[1327]  Suppose you were a neighbor of the Danites and one of them said to you, "Brother, why are you so foolish as to travel all the way to Shiloh?
[1328]  We need to understand the proper meaning of apostasy.
[1329]  Apostasy means to be distracted from the right track in following God.
[1330]  Whenever someone uses the worship of God as a cloak to take a devilish way, he has fallen into apostasy.
[1331]  THE RECOVERY WITH GAD A. Coming Back to the Victory of Christ
[1332]  Praise the Lord that, under the inspiration of God, after Dan, Jacob spoke of Gad!
[1333]  THE SUFFICIENCY OF ASHER A. The Exceeding Blessing and Surpassing Grace
[1334]  After the recovery with Gad, we have the sufficiency of Asher.
[1335]  Although Asher is wonderful, he is still not the end of Jacob's poetic prophecy with blessing.
[1336]  In this message we come to the last group of Jacob's twelve sons mentioned in his prophecy with blessing, the group composed of Joseph and Benjamin 49:22-27 .
[1337]  13 Concerning Joseph a A Son of a Fruitful Tree by a Fountain
[1338]  Genesis 49:22 says, "A son of a fruitful tree is Joseph, a son of a fruitful tree by a fountain; whose branches run over the wall" Heb .
[1339]  Firstly, Joseph is a son of a fruitful tree.
[1340]  Verse 23 says, "The archers have bitterly harassed him, and shot at him, and lay in wait for him" Heb .
[1341]  f His Majesty Being like the Firstborn of His Ox,
[1342]  Now we come to the two main points concerning Benjamin.
[1343]  Genesis 49:27 says, "Benjamin is a tearing wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and in the evening he shall divide the spoil" Heb .
[1344]  I became familiar with the history of Jacob's twelve sons long before I realized how sweet and wonderful their history was.
[1345]  The more time I spend on Genesis 49, the more I appreciate these twelve sons.
[1346]  On the one hand, when I look at these twelve sons of Jacob, I marvel at them; on the other hand, I am thankful to God, because in them I see a picture of myself.
[1347]  I. FRUITFUL A. A Son of a Fruitful Tree
[1348]  These branches are branching out over the wall 49:22 , that is, they are spreading Christ over all restrictions, magnifying Him in all circumstances Phil 1:20 .
[1349]  Genesis 49:22 says that Joseph's branches run over the wall.
[1350]  In Acts 5 Gamaliel spoke a good word: "Stay away from these men and leave them alone; for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest perhaps you even be found fighters against God" vv.
[1351]  If this is not the Lord's recovery, it should be overthrown.
[1352]  Deuteronomy 33:17 says, "His majesty is like the firstborn of his ox, and his horns are like the horns of a wild ox: with them he shall push the peoples together to the ends of the earth: and these are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh" Heb .
[1353]  In the previous message I pointed out that when Christ comes back, He will push the Russians away from the good land.
[1354]  Genesis 49:24 also speaks of the Shepherd, the stone of Israel, and verse 25 says, "Even by the God of thy father, who helpeth thee; and by the All-sufficient, who blesseth thee" Heb .
[1355]  The history of these twelve sons begins with a sinner, that is, it begins with sin, even with a gross sin, not a refined sin.
[1356]  At the beginning we have a person who is full of sin, and at the end we have a person who receives the universal blessing.
[1357]  Joseph was also blessed with the dew Deut 33:13 .
[1358]  Dew is a finer blessing than either rain or snow.
[1359]  Deuteronomy 33:14 also speaks of "the precious things put forth by the moon."
[1360]  Deuteronomy 33:16 speaks of the "precious things of the earth and its fulness" Heb .
[1361]  In 1 Corinthians 3:21 and 22 we find a New Testament word that corresponds to this: "For all things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours."
[1362]  As we have pointed out a number of times, the record of Jacob's blessing found in Genesis 49 begins with a sinner and ends with the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling.
[1363]  If we have a proper knowledge of the Bible, we shall see that the entire Bible issues in the universal blessing of God and in His eternal dwelling.
[1364]  In the previous message we covered the first eight aspects of the universal blessing.
[1365]  In his blessing of Joseph, Jacob used many poetic expressions, such as ancient mountains, eternal hills, and the utmost bound of the eternal hills.
[1366]  Finally, Joseph was blessed with "the good will of him that dwelt in the bush" Deut 33:16 .
[1367]  V. DWELT A. By the Lord between Benjamin's Shoulders
[1368]  Genesis 49:27 says that Benjamin is a tearing wolf Heb .
[1369]  But Deuteronomy 33:12 says of him, "The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders."
[1370]  Deuteronomy 33:12 says that Benjamin will dwell in safety by the Lord.
[1371]  Although we may not have very much experience yet, we nonetheless can testify that we are today's Benjamin, that God has His dwelling place between our shoulders, and that all our being is under His overshadowing.
[1372]  According to Isaiah 66:1 and 2 those who are poor and contrite in spirit are the place of God's rest.
[1373]  No other place in the entire universe, in the heavens or on the earth, is God's rest.
[1374]  As those poor and contrite in spirit, we should be able to say, "Lord, come in. Lord, I'm vacant, unoccupied, ready for You.
[1375]  No matter how long you have been in the church life, you need to pray such a prayer, to ask the Lord to have His dwelling in you.
[1376]  In Ephesians 3:16 and 17 the Apostle Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts.
[1377]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION
[1378]  With this message we conclude the series of messages on chapter forty-nine.
[1379]  Genesis 49:22-26 and Deuteronomy 33:13-16 indicate that the blessing upon Joseph is universal and eternal.
[1380]  It is from the ancient mountains to the eternal hills.
[1381]  THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH A. All Things Made New
[1382]  If we expect to receive blessing from God with respect to our spiritual life, health, our families, or our homes, all these things must be new.
[1383]  When the new heaven and new earth appear, there will be no more sea Rev 21:1 .
[1384]  The sea is the source of the demons, which keep things away from God.
[1385]  Since Satan's rebellion, God has been continually working to eliminate the sea.
[1386]  Now we go on to consider the eternal dwelling.
[1387]  Revelation 21:3 says, "And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them."
[1388]  If there are one thousand saints and God is dwelling among them, they will consider God to be number one thousand one.
[1389]  In the eternal dwelling God within us will be our light, and Christ will be our lamp to express the very God who is within us Rev 21:11, 23; 22:5 .
[1390]  Whatever God is, whatever God has, and whatever God can do becomes our enjoyment and blessing; and whatever we are and have becomes God's dwelling place.
[1391]  THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY 7 h Departing in an Excellent Way
[1392]  In this message we come to Jacob's departure, which we shall consider in some detail.
[1393]  In past messages we have seen how Jacob was born, how he had been selected by God before his birth, and how he was striving, even when he was still in his mother's womb.
[1394]  1 Asking Joseph to Put His Hand under His Thigh
[1395]  Genesis 47:29 says, "And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh."
[1396]  This matter of having Joseph place his hand under Jacob's thigh has been a problem to many Bible students.
[1397]  Jacob did not say to Joseph, "Do your best to get a physician to heal me."
[1398]  Jacob, however, viewed his death as sleep 47:30, Heb .
[1399]  4 Worshipping God on the Top of His Staff
[1400]  As Jacob was dying, he worshipped God 47:31, LXX; Heb 11:21 .
[1401]  It is not an insignificant matter that a dying man would worship God.
[1402]  As we have seen, his being confined to bed revealed that he had no more natural strength, that he could not move, and that his trust was completely in God.
[1403]  The bed signifies that Jacob had no human strength, but the staff signifies that he was a person filled with the experience of God in his life.
[1404]  Therefore, at the end of his life, Jacob worshipped God on his bed, signifying that he had no strength, and on his staff, signifying that the God whom he worshipped had shepherded him throughout his life.
[1405]  I hope that when we depart from this earth we shall worship God in this way, not worshipping One whom we have not experienced, but worshipping the One whom we have experienced throughout our lifetime.
[1406]  In 48:15 Jacob spoke of God as the One who "shepherded me all my life long unto this day" Heb .
[1407]  I hope that all of us will be able to say at the time of our departure that our life was under God's shepherding.
[1408]  The more we study it, the more we realize that no human hand could have written it.
[1409]  Apparently Genesis is simply a book of stories; however, when we probe into the depths of this book through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we find that it contains something profound related to our experience of life.
[1410]  When we first came to Abraham in this life-study, we pointed out that, in spiritual experience, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals.
[1411]  We have seen the process of Jacob's maturity and the manifestation of his maturity.
[1412]  This typifies the aspect of the constitution of Christ in the mature life that is the shepherding life to take care of others.
[1413]  In chapter thirty-seven Joseph not only fed and shepherded the flock; although he was the second youngest brother, he was sent by his father to shepherd his brothers.
[1414]  Joseph, the one with the shepherding aspect, was also his father's beloved 37:3-4 .
[1415]  Likewise, Christ was the Father's beloved Son Matt 3:17; 17:5 .
[1416]  You can testify that at times you have had the deep sense that the Father was present with you, and you could sense Him saying, "This is My beloved."
[1417]  Although you may be young in the Lord, I believe that you have experienced the Father God in heaven being very happy with you and pleased with you.
[1418]  Although Joseph was a shepherd and the father's beloved and although he ministered to his brothers according to his father's will, he was hated and harassed by the brothers to whom he ministered 37:4-5, 8, 11, 18-36 .
[1419]  Christ was sent to minister to the children of God, but they hated Him.
[1420]  Now I have a heavy burden to share something very meaningful with you.
[1421]  If you had been Joseph, would you have considered your brothers heavenly and full of life and light?
[1422]  b As the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars of Light
[1423]  In the Bible there is the principle of confirmation by two witnesses.
[1424]  This indicates that in the eyes of God all the condemned and accused people are full of light.
[1425]  Although God's people are positioned in heaven as the sun, the moon, and the stars, they are living on earth as sheaves Phil 3:20; 2:15 , for sheaves grow in the field.
[1426]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN JOSEPH'S LIVING CORRESPONDING
[1427]  The book of Genesis, in which nearly all of the truths in the Bible are sown as seeds, may be considered a biography of eight great men: Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.
[1428]  The first three chapters regarding the reigning part of a matured life are chapters thirty-seven, thirty-eight, and thirty-nine.
[1429]  As a child, I used to dislike these chapters because they were filled with hatred, plotting, and betrayals.
[1430]  LIVING AS A STAR OF LIGHT A. His Brother Judah
[1431]  Joseph's life under the heavenly vision was the life of the kingdom of the heavens described in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.
[1432]  If we claim to be the kingdom people, yet we cannot subdue our anger or conquer our lust, we are finished.
[1433]  In the book of Genesis, Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature life.
[1434]  As such a representative, Joseph typifies Christ, for the reigning aspect of the mature life is Christ constituted into our being.
[1435]  We have seen that Joseph typifies Christ as the beloved Son of God, as the One sent by God the Father to shepherd God's people, and as the One who was persecuted by those whom He was sent to shepherd.
[1436]  Joseph's betrayal was followed by a period of confinement, a period of imprisonment 39:20 .
[1437]  Joseph was with two criminals, who typified the two criminals with Christ, one of whom was restored and the other executed 40:1-23 .
[1438]  Joseph was tested by the fact that his dreams were not fulfilled.
[1439]  If I had been Joseph, I would certainly have been encouraged, and I would have said, "Even though I have not yet seen the fulfillment of my dreams, I have the confirmation that the fulfillment will certainly come.
[1440]  Young people, do not think that in just two years you will become a giant.
[1441]  No, like Joseph, you must wait until you are thirty years of age.
[1442]  For instance, the priests had to be thirty years old before they could enter into the full priesthood, and the Lord Jesus also began His ministry when He was thirty.
[1443]  Some of you may think that this word about waiting until the age of thirty to be put into the full ministry is a contradiction of what I have said elsewhere regarding the elders of the church in Jerusalem probably being under the age of thirty.
[1444]  In this message we come to Genesis 41, which unfolds more of the details of Joseph's life.
[1445]  Joseph also typified Christ as the One enthroned with authority 41:40-44; Matt 28:18; Acts 2:36; Rev 3:21 .
[1446]  On the same day Joseph was released from the dungeon, he was enthroned to be the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt.
[1447]  Acts 2:36 says that the crucified and resurrected Christ has been made both Lord and Christ.
[1448]  On the day of Pentecost, the Apostle Peter seemed to be saying to the Israelites who had rejected the Lord, "The One you rejected, put on the cross, and killed, God has raised up from the dead.
[1449]  The ancient Egyptians used their ring as a seal.
[1450]  Whatever they sealed with their ring was something important to them.
[1451]  At the time of Christ's ascension and enthronement, Christ received of the Father the Holy Spirit that He might use Him as a seal to put on all His believers.
[1452]  Even if you were to go to a gambling casino in Las Vegas, you would still have this seal upon you, and it would make you feel that, because you belong to Jesus, you should not stay in such a place.
[1453]  We all have received the first garment, and there is no problem regarding our salvation.
[1454]  We are saved and we shall spend eternity with the Lord.
[1455]  This is more certain than a policy from the most trustworthy insurance company.
[1456]  We cannot at the present time be as certain of this as we are of the first garment, for we may not have paid the necessary premium for this second policy.
[1457]  Because Christ was resurrected, enthroned, glorified, and received gifts, He is the Savior of the world.
[1458]  In 41:45 we see that Joseph took as his wife Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On.
[1459]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE SECRET OF JOSEPH'S RELEASE
[1460]  This message is a parenthesis covering the secret of Joseph's release and exaltation.
[1461]  Although I may have no intention of putting you in a dungeon and although you may have no intention of putting me in a dungeon, what actually happens is that we put one another into a dungeon.
[1462]  When you were married, did you intend to put your wife into a dungeon?
[1463]  Joseph was truly a dreamer, and his life was a life of dreams.
[1464]  A victorious and overcoming Christian will always be a dreamer.
[1465]  Let me give a testimony of our experience in Taiwan.
[1466]  When we first arrived in Taiwan, we found it to be a backward, primitive island.
[1467]  Nevertheless, we began to speak according to our vision.
[1468]  To many readers of the book of Genesis, the stories of Joseph are like the stories told to kindergarten children.
[1469]  However, we must remember that in the book of Genesis the seeds of nearly all the spiritual truths are sown.
[1470]  But if we see that Jacob had passed through so many tests and had become matured in life, we shall see that the record of Joseph is not merely a story, but a revelation of the reigning aspect of a matured saint.
[1471]  16 Recognized by the Children of Israel a The Whole Earth Being under Famine
[1472]  Genesis 41:56 says, "And the famine was over all the face of the earth," and verse 57 says that "the famine was severe in all lands" Heb .
[1473]  At the time of chapter forty-two the whole earth was under famine.
[1474]  When we eat and drink, we do not merely have the sense that we are maintaining our existence, but that we are being satisfied.
[1475]  c The Children of Israel Forced to Turn to Christ
[1476]  The Scriptures prophesy that the children of Israel will be forced to turn to Christ just as Joseph's brothers were forced to turn to him for food 42:1-5 .
[1477]  Zechariah 12:10 says, "They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn."
[1478]  In Romans 11:26 Paul says, "So all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion, He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob."
[1479]  As Joseph was disciplining his brothers, he loved them in a secret way 42:25 .
[1480]  According to the prophecies in the Bible, the Lord will also exercise His sovereign authority to provide for all the needs of the nation of Israel.
[1481]  LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN JOSEPH'S DEALING WITH HIS BROTHERS
[1482]  In this message, another parenthesis in our life-study, we come back to the line of Joseph's personal life.
[1483]  I love the line of life even more than the line of Joseph as a type of Christ.
[1484]  As I was contacting the Lord with a praying spirit, the Lord showed me the points in chapter forty-two regarding Joseph's personal life which we shall cover in this message.
[1485]  When Joseph saw his brothers bowing down to him, he was not hasty to reveal his glory to them cf.
[1486]  Joseph was also wise in his discipline of Simeon.
[1487]  In 42:19 and 20 Joseph said to his brothers, "If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses: but bring your youngest brother unto me."
[1488]  As the ruler, Joseph could have done what was necessary to have his father brought to him immediately.
[1489]  But he disciplined his brothers for their good at the sacrifice of his own enjoyment of seeing his father.
[1490]  According to God's ordination, there should be no divorce.
[1491]  Neither in married life nor in the church life should there be divorce.
[1492]  In the eyes of God, there is no escape, no emergency exit, from the church life.
[1493]  The story of Joseph's being recognized by his brothers is the longest story in the book of Genesis, occupying three and a half chapters, from the beginning of chapter forty-two to the middle of chapter forty-five.
[1494]  When I was young, I thought that Joseph was too hard on his brothers.
[1495]  As a man of God, he had the patience to discipline them, and for at least six months they underwent a trial.
[1496]  Joseph's brothers were ignorant concerning Joseph 43:18-21 , and the Jews today are ignorant of Christ.
[1497]  Joseph's brothers did not know that he was the ruler in Egypt.
[1498]  After the brothers came the second time, Joseph showed them love by feasting with them in his residence.
[1499]  Although they did not recognize him, he wanted to indicate to them that he was intimate with them, even as he was testing them.
[1500]  Immediately after Joseph returned, he had his brothers sit before him, "the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth" 43:33 .
[1501]  Certainly they should have realized by this indication that this ruler was Joseph.
[1502]  Today there are not many who know the Lord in this way.
[1503]  However, there are a few who recognize the indications of the Lord's deeds and realize that what happened to them was of the Lord.
[1504]  In our knowing of the Lord, most of us are exactly like Joseph's brothers.
[1505]  All of us today are under the hand of our Joseph.
[1506]  What we should do and where we should go is up to Him.
[1507]  How long it will be before we come back to Him depends on how much food He gives us.
[1508]  As we consider the story of Joseph, we need to remember that in his record there are two lines: the line of Joseph as a type of Christ and the line of life.
[1509]  It is difficult to find in the Old Testament anyone besides Joseph who was such a perfect type of Christ.
[1510]  I believe that the time is near when Christ will acknowledge the ignorant nation of Israel Rom 11:26 .
[1511]  As we read this story, we see Joseph's patience and wisdom.
[1512]  Only a matured person has such patience and wisdom.
[1513]  Although Joseph was just about forty years of age, in his spiritual life he was matured.
[1514]  His concern for them is seen in the fact that he charged them not to quarrel with one another on the way home 45:24, Heb .
[1515]  Reuben or Levi might have said, "Throughout our entire life we were never disciplined as much as we were in these last months."
[1516]  If we would get into the depths of the record of Joseph's life, we must find the seeds sown there and see that this record contains an account of a reigning life.
[1517]  Before we consider the seeds and the reigning life found in chapters forty-five through forty-seven, we need to consider two further points regarding Joseph as a type of Christ.
[1518]  r Israel Participating in the Enjoyment of Christ's Reign
[1519]  After Christ reveals Himself to the remnant of Israel, He will begin His millennial reign.
[1520]  During the millennium, the Jews will participate in the enjoyment of Christ's reign, just as Joseph's brothers participated in the enjoyment of his reign 45:18; 47:4-6 .
[1521]  In like manner, what is offered to God during the thousand years will become the portion of the Jews, who will be the priests instructing the people on earth, especially the Egyptians, in the way to worship God.
[1522]  Whatever he did was based upon the principle of self-denial.
[1523]  I do not know of any other person who was offended to the degree Joseph was, yet who had not the slightest desire for revenge.
[1524]  He said, "Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life" 45:5 .
[1525]  Joseph's realization that God was the One who had sent him to Egypt is a seed of the truth found in Romans 8:28.
[1526]  Joseph's life is an illustration of this verse and an example of how everything works for good for those who love God.
[1527]  The seed sown in the book of Genesis grows in Romans 8:28 and is harvested in Revelation 15, where we see the overcomers standing on the sea of glass, which signifies trials, tests, and sufferings.
[1528]  After suffering for thirteen years, Joseph was enthroned to be the ruler of the earth.
[1529]  We may wonder why he did not do something to satisfy this longing as soon as he was enthroned.
[1530]  When Joseph did send for his father, he himself did not go to get him.
[1531]  We cannot say that he did not have the time, for when his father died he had the time to bury him.
[1532]  In order to answer this question we need to discover what the Bible does not say.
[1533]  Joseph had the position and the power to do whatever he desired.
[1534]  More than forty years ago, I heard someone say that the strongest thing is to be able not to do something that you can do.
[1535]  You have the power, the position, and the opportunity to do a certain thing, yet you still do not do it.
[1536]  But in the past I did not see that after Joseph had been enthroned to be the ruler of Egypt, he did not use his power to see his father.
[1537]  As we have pointed out a number of times, in the story of Joseph there are two lines: the line of the type and the line of life.
[1538]  Before we consider further the line of life, we need to see another point regarding Joseph as a type of Christ.
[1539]  This typifies that during the millennium Christ will take special care of Israel.
[1540]  Israel's specific function on earth is to testify of God.
[1541]  If we do not suffer, we have nothing to give others.
[1542]  Because the grapevine undergoes many sufferings, dealings, cuttings, and breakings, it produces rich wine to cheer man.
[1543]  Brother Nee realized that the more we suffer, the more we have to give.
[1544]  The people who came to Joseph for food paid four kinds of prices: their money, their cattle, their land, and themselves.
[1545]  How happy I am that the record in the Bible is so complete!
[1546]  These four items cover all the prices we need to pay today.
[1547]  When we pay with our money, cattle, lands, and ourselves, we receive all four types of supply.
[1548]  The last item the Lord requires is ourselves, including every aspect of our being.
[1549]  If they have, you will not listen to anything other than Christ.
[1550]  When the Lord Jesus comes, the whole earth will be under one landlord and one banker.
[1551]  All the land will belong to Christ, and we shall hand over whatever we have and whatever we are to Him.
[1552]  Because the offended one could comfort the offending ones, they could enjoy a pleasant life in the kingdom.
