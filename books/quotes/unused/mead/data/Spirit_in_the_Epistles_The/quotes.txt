[3]  PART ONE THE SPIRIT IN THE EPISTLES CHAPTER ONE THE LORD BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT
[4]  And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.
[5]  Now all this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel" which is translated, God with us .
[6]  We all know that the first part of the New Testament consists of the Gospels.
[7]  THE GENERAL SUBJECT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT EPISTLES THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT
[8]  There is a verse in the Bible that has been ignored by most Christians, and that is 1 Corinthians 15:45b: "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."
[9]  Acts chapters one and two speak of the Holy Spirit, and chapter sixteen still refers to the Holy Spirit v. 6 , but immediately after referring to the Holy Spirit, it shifts to the Spirit of Jesus v. 7 . In Acts 16 the title the Spirit of Jesus appears.
[10]  I believe the brothers and sisters understand that this is very different from the concept of most believers.
[11]  Today the Spirit of God is not merely the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[12]  For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.
[13]  Romans is a book that particularly gives an outline of the Christian life.
[14]  The Lord said, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly" John 10:10 .
[15]  It is by His being in us as the Spirit of life.
[16]  When you are in your spirit and not in your knowledge or thoughts, when you are in your spirit and not in your emotions or preferences, when you are in your spirit and not in your opinions, when you live in your spirit and turn to your spirit to contact the Spirit of life, the result is that you are released.
[17]  Furthermore, the Spirit of life is also the Spirit of sonship for us to enter into sonship.
[18]  First, the Spirit of sonship witnesses in you that you are a son of God.
[19]  Formerly, as a descendant of Adam, you were a sinner, but now since you have the Lord Jesus in you, you have the life of the Son and also the Spirit of the Son.
[20]  No matter how much we enjoy the Spirit of life, what we have enjoyed is only the firstfruits as a foretaste.
[21]  To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.
[22]  BEING BUILT UP BY GROWING AND BEING TRANSFORMED IN SPIRIT
[23]  And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.
[24]  Up to this point, the message on 1 Corinthians may be considered completed.
[25]  Chapter seven shows us that such a one who lives in the spirit is not so clear that he is in the spirit.
[26]  This is the case in 1 Corinthians 7, where Paul said concerning marriage, "I charge, not I but the Lord" v. 10 ; "I say, I, not the Lord" v. 12 . In effect, he was saying, "This is my word, not the Lord's." However, after saying so much, eventually he said, "She is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God" v. 40 . This shows that the more a person lives in spirit, he is not so clear in his feeling that he is living in spirit.
[27]  But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
[28]  Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.
[29]  This chapter first shows that this Spirit who is in us as the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging is also the inscribing Spirit.
[30]  We are like a piece of paper, and the Spirit of life is like ink, with which Christ is inscribed into us.
[31]  Then 2 Corinthians 3 shows that the Spirit is the inscribing Spirit v. 3 and the Spirit who gives life v. 6 . Moreover, verse 8 of the same chapter mentions "the ministry of the Spirit." Therefore, the Spirit is also the ministering Spirit.
[32]  Therefore, in 2 Corinthians the Spirit is the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging, and He is also the inscribing Spirit, the ministering Spirit, the Spirit who gives life, the freeing Spirit, and the transforming Spirit.
[33]  Romans leads us to see the Body, whereas 1 Corinthians shows us that the Body needs to be built, that the Spirit within us is the building Spirit, and that the basic need for the building is transformation.
[34]  THE SOUL-LIFE BEING CONSUMED AND THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL BEING RENEWED
[35]  Following chapter three of 2 Corinthians, chapter four says that there is a treasure in earthen vessels.
[36]  The sequence of the books of the Bible is very meaningful, and we believe it is the arrangement of the Holy Spirit.
[37]  In Romans we see how the Spirit of sonship carries out a sanctifying work in us so that we may have the image of God's Son.
[38]  Then from Galatians to Philemon we see a more detailed explanation of how we can become sons of God, how the Son of God can be wrought into us, how we can live by the Son of God, and how we can become the Body of Christ, thus completely living in the life-giving Spirit.
[39]  DYING TO THE LAW THAT CHRIST MAY BE FORMED IN US
[40]  The apostle wrote the book of Galatians with a strong intention to break down the Galatians' concept of keeping the law.
[41]  WALKING BY THE SPIRIT TO BEAR THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT
[42]  If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
[43]  But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[44]  For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire.
[45]  Following the book of Galatians is the book of Ephesians.
[46]  The Spirit in Galatians is for us to have Christ, live by Christ, and live out Christ, or we may say, for us to have the Son of God, live by the Son of God, and live out the Son of God.
[47]  Unless we know the Spirit and live in the Spirit, everything we say about Christ is doctrinal, not experiential.
[48]  If we want to receive Christ and let Him come into us, and if we want to live out Christ, express Him, and let Him become the outward fruit, then we must have the "story" of the Spirit and be in the Spirit.
[49]  The Spirit in Galatians is for us to live by Christ and live out Christ, whereas the Spirit in Ephesians is for us to have the Body life, the church life.
[50]  There are nine main points concerning the Spirit covered in the entire book of Ephesians.
[51]  In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory.
[52]  For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.
[53]  We both have access unto the Father not by being inspired by the Spirit but by being in one Spirit.
[54]  And do not be drunk with wine but be filled in spirit.
[55]  For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.
[56]  In this portion of the Word, the fact that Christ will be magnified as always whether through life or through death is mentioned together with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[57]  MANIFESTING CHRIST IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST
[58]  Philippians gives us four aspects concerning the experience of Christ.
[59]  The third aspect is to have fellowship with the saints in spirit.
[60]  For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.
[61]  And you having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit. v. 6
[62]  When man was created, nothing in the universe had the nature of God.
[63]  None of the millions of creatures were holy; only God Himself was holy.
[64]  But one day this God, who is Spirit and who is holy, became flesh to be mingled with man and to put on humanity.
[65]  Even though I am here in prison, in bonds and chains, yet this Spirit, who is not only the Spirit of Jesus but also the Spirit of Christ, and not only the Spirit of suffering but also the Spirit of resurrection, will enable me to overcome the afflictions and bonds."
[66]  Now let us come to 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
[67]  Brothers and sisters, I hope that you can see that the general subject of the New Testament Epistles is the life-giving Spirit.
[68]  In Romans, this life-giving Spirit as the Spirit of sonship is conforming us to the image of God's Son.
[69]  Brothers and sisters, over thirty years ago when we spoke about sanctification, we taught the same doctrine that was taught by the Brethren.
[70]  But as we studied the Bible again, we gradually learned that the word sanctification does not merely mean separation.
[71]  CHAPTER NINE FIRST AND SECOND TIMOTHY, TITUS, AND PHILEMON FIRST AND SECOND TIMOTHY THE GUARDING SPIRIT The Speaking Spirit
[72]  Let us first look at the book of 1 Timothy.
[73]  First Timothy 4:1 says, "But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons."
[74]  I believe we all understand now that the mention of the Spirit in this way indicates that this Spirit is not purely the objective Holy Spirit, but the objective Holy Spirit becoming the subjective Holy Spirit dwelling in our spirit and being mingled with our spirit as one spirit.
[75]  With us in the New Testament, it is the Spirit of life dwelling in our spirit and being mingled with us as one spirit speaking the word of God.
[76]  Second Timothy 1:7 says, "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness."
[77]  CHAPTER TEN HEBREWS THE SPIRIT OF GRACE THE SPEAKING SPIRIT
[78]  The Epistle to the Hebrews firstly shows us that the Holy Spirit is the speaking Spirit.
[79]  Hebrews 3:7-8 says, "Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness.'"
[80]  The Holy Spirit here is a very emphatic term; according to Greek, it is the Spirit the Holy.
[81]  Therefore, the word spoken by the Holy Spirit here in Hebrews is different from the word spoken by the Spirit in 1 Timothy 4:1.
[82]  What the Spirit says there in 1 Timothy 4:1 is not a quotation from the Old Testament but the sensation given to us by the Spirit in our spirit, whereas here in Hebrews the Holy Spirit speaks by quoting the words in the Old Testament.
[83]  THE ETERNAL SPIRIT Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God.
[84]  The Lord Jesus' offering Himself to God on the cross was through the eternal Spirit.
[85]  It is easy to understand the speaking Spirit, and it is also easy to understand the Spirit of grace, the Spirit of enjoyment, but it is not so easy to understand the eternal Spirit.
[86]  DISCERNING THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL AND ENTERING INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES
[87]  Now we come to Hebrews 4:12, which says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
[88]  If you do not know how to discern the spirit from the soul, you will have no way to enjoy the Spirit of grace or to enter into the eternal Spirit.
[89]  Dear brothers and sisters, learn to enter into the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of grace.
[90]  If they turn to their spirit, it is only a moment before they come out of their spirit.
[91]  CHAPTER ELEVEN JAMES THROUGH JUDE JAMES THE SPIRIT OF ENVY
[92]  Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: "The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy"?
[93]  First Peter has more references to the indwelling Spirit.
[94]  Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
[95]  If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
[96]  This verse tells us that the Spirit is of glory, that He is full of glory.
[97]  Furthermore, the phrase the Spirit of glory and of God means that the Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God.
[98]  When you are persecuted for the Lord, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of glory, rests upon you.
[99]  And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.
[100]  And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.
[101]  This tells us that we and God, God and we, mutually abide in one another and that this mutual abiding is a matter in the Spirit.
[102]  I was in spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.
[103]  In chapter four, at the beginning it says that there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne was God.
[104]  And I fell before his feet to worship him.
[105]  PART TWO THE SPIRIT IN THE EPISTLES OF PAUL CHAPTER ONE THE REALITY OF THE BIBLE BEING IN THE SPIRIT CHRISTIANITY EMPHASIZING DOCTRINE BUT LACKING THE SPIRIT
[106]  I think I need to say an opening word.
[107]  THE FOCAL POINT OF THE BIBLE BEING THE SPIRIT
[108]  It is not a problem to say that the Bible is a book of doctrines.
[109]  THE FOUR GOSPELS SPEAKING ABOUT THE LORD'S BECOMING THE SPIRIT TO BE RECEIVED BY MAN
[110]  The first four books of the New Testament are the Gospels.
[111]  We must worship God that not only do the words in the holy Scriptures contain the revelations of God, but even the arrangement of the books of the Scripture implies God's sovereignty.
[112]  HENCEFORTH, PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE SPIRIT THAN TO THE OBJECTIVE WORD
[113]  Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, our eyes need to be opened that henceforth, although we should not neglect the word, we must pay more attention to the Spirit.
[114]  Of course, we need a certain amount of speaking in order to make clear the matter concerning the Spirit, but we absolutely must not speak empty, spiritual theories.
[115]  CHAPTER TWO THE SPIRIT IN ROMANS 1 THE DIFFICULTY IN TOUCHING THE SPIRIT OF THE BIBLE
[116]  Many Christians admit that the problem in reading the Bible is that it is relatively easy to find the peripheral things but not very easy to find the central matter.
[117]  This may be compared to contacting a person; it is hard to perceive the life within him even though it is easy to touch his physical members.
[118]  In the same principle, when you read expositions of the Bible, you can find many commentaries on Romans.
[119]  The Holy Spirit Pouring Out the Redemptive Love in Us
[120]  After referring to the spirit in 2:29, Romans contains a long section to cover the matter of redemption.
[121]  Since God could not do anything with fallen man, He had to do the work of redemption first.
[122]  Concerning the matter of life, Romans first says in 5:10 that we will be saved in the life of God's Son, and in 5:17 it says that we will reign in life.
[123]  Then in 6:4 it says that we have died and have been buried with Christ that we may walk in newness of life.
[124]  As we read on, we see in verse 16 that this Spirit is within us and is witnessing with our spirit.
[125]  This Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is dwelling in us.
[126]  Eventually, this Spirit is mingled with our spirit as one.
[127]  The central thought of Romans is that this Spirit comes into us to become our life, and we simply live according to this Spirit, walk according to this Spirit, care for this Spirit, and set our mind on this Spirit.
[128]  CHAPTER THREE THE SPIRIT IN ROMANS 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 7:24-25; 8:1, 4-6; 12:2, 11; 14:17 THE SPIRIT OF LIFE GIVING US SUBJECTIVE SALVATION
[129]  In the preceding chapter we saw that the Lord who accomplished redemption is the Spirit of life today.
[130]  He died on the cross to redeem us who were fallen, to quicken us who were dead, to restore us who were damaged, and to cleanse us who were defiled.
[131]  THE KEY TO OUR EXPERIENCING THE SALVATION OF LIFE BEING OUR MIND
[132]  If you want to experience Him as the Spirit of life, you must know your spirit and learn to discern the spirit from the soul.
[133]  The Mind Being Dependent on the Spirit to Experience Salvation
[134]  Thank the Lord, in Romans 8 the mind enters into another stage.
[135]  The mind that is set on the spirit needs to be renewed and transformed because it is old.
[136]  Therefore, we need to listen to messages and read the Bible, because listening to messages and reading the Scriptures can transform our mind.
[137]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SPIRIT IN FIRST CORINTHIANS GOD MAKING CHRIST EVERYTHING TO US
[138]  In 1 Corinthians chapter one the apostle Paul tells us that God's intention is to give Christ to us as our everything instead of giving us so many other things.
[139]  You may ask what my basis for saying this is.
[140]  If you read chapter two, you will find the spirit.
[141]  Verse 14 in chapter two says, "But a soulish man that is, one who lives according to the soul and in the soul does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him."
[142]  May I ask you, what are the things of the Spirit of God?
[143]  Many expositors acknowledge that this chapter speaks most clearly of the Spirit being the indwelling Spirit.
[144]  Verse 16 says, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
[145]  After pointing out some of these things to you, brothers and sisters, I believe that you surely must have seen something clearly.
[146]  Now let me ask you again, what does 1 Corinthians chapters two to sixteen speak about?
[147]  What I would like to tell you, however, is that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son to enjoy Him and that God has also put us in Christ, making Christ everything to us.
[148]  Now we go on to 2 Corinthians, which experientially is altogether a continuation of 1 Corinthians.
[149]  THE KIND OF PERSONS BEING ABLE TO REMAIN IN SPIRIT
[150]  Brothers and sisters, I would like you to know that 1 Corinthians shows us a picture: Here there is a temple with a group of people: Some are in the outer court, others are in the Holy Place, and still others are in the Holy of Holies.
[151]  First Corinthians seems also to show us a map: Some people are in Egypt, others are wandering in the wilderness, and only a few have entered into Canaan.
[152]  Experiencing the Spirit as the Anointing and as the Pledge
[153]  Now let us consider 1:20-22: "For as many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us to God.
[154]  A certain brother may have enjoyed wonderful fellowship with the Lord in the last two days, so he is very meek and humble.
[155]  Therefore, we can see that the entire chapter is speaking about the Spirit not the Spirit of inspiration but the Spirit who gives life, not the Spirit of gifts but the Spirit of ministry, not the Spirit for us to experience in an outward, superficial, and shallow way but the Spirit who is constituting us from within.
[156]  When I was young, I heard people say that in the entire Scriptures there is no prayer addressed to the Holy Spirit, and that we have to ask the Father to give us the Holy Spirit and ask the Lord to pour down the Holy Spirit.
[157]  At that time I felt that this is right, and even today I still acknowledge that this truth has its place in the Scriptures.
[158]  However, gradually, one day in my experience I realized that the Lord is the Spirit; therefore, when I talk to the Spirit, I talk to the Lord, and when I talk to the Lord, I talk to the Spirit.
[159]  It is true that the Bible does not tell us to pray to the Holy Spirit but tells us to pray only to the Father.
[160]  Yet when our realization deepens to a certain degree, we will feel that praying to the Spirit is exactly the same as praying to the Father, because the Lord is the Spirit.
[161]  What I have just said shows you that when our experience of the Lord is shallow, we always feel that the Lord is far away and that the Holy Spirit is only a means by which we can know and experience the Lord.
[162]  Now we come to the conclusion of 2 Corinthians.
[163]  But this book says it this way: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all" 13:14 .
[164]  You will remember that in chapter one Paul said that they were pressed by the sufferings that came upon them to such an extent that they could not trust in their wisdom but could only trust in the grace of God v. 12 . Moreover, in chapter twelve the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you" v. 9 . Then at the conclusion of chapter thirteen Paul said, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all." When he said this word, he showed the source, the origin, of this grace.
[165]  CHAPTER SIX THE SPIRIT IN THE FOUR BOOKS FROM GALATIANS TO COLOSSIANS
[166]  We may say that Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians occupy an important central position in the New Testament.
[167]  Galatians is concerning Christ as our life, whereas Ephesians is concerning the expression of Christ, which is the church.
[168]  Once again, in Galatians we see that Christ is our life, while in Ephesians we see that the church is the expression of Christ.
[169]  The book of Philippians shows us in a more specific way how we can experience this Christ.
[170]  Philippians speaks altogether about the experiences in Christ and our experience of Christ.
[171]  Let us first take a brief look at the two books of Thessalonians.
[172]  Because these two books are especially concerned about the Lord's coming again, they mention the matter of the Spirit only a few times.
[173]  Let us read on: "Nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies" v.
[174]  Let us now go on to 1:18-19: "This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you might war the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith."
[175]  Therefore, in 2 Timothy 1:6-7 Paul said, "I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
[176]  This tells us that during the decline of the church, not only should we have a strong spirit within, but we should also know that the Spirit who dwells in us is the preserving Spirit, the guarding Spirit.
