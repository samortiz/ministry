   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After this sealing, the Holy Spirit stays in us as a pledge to guarantee us that we have the right to inherit God as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are God's inheritance not poor sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As mere sinners we have nothing and are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are His inheritance because we have been redeemed into Christ as the element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because Christ is our element, we have been made excellent, a treasure to be God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God Himself is also our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His divine attributes have become the unsearchable riches of Christ which we inherit.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As saints, legally speaking, we are qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have a righteous standing, a legal standing, to inherit all the things of God!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually all the things of God are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is life; God is love; God is righteousness; God is holiness; God is power; God is strength; and God is might.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We inherit Him, who is everything, as our inheritance.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose that Christ did not die or shed His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then He would have nothing based upon which He could make a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But He died for us according to God's righteous requirements, and the blood He shed through that death was used to form a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even He Himself said that the cup of the Lord's table was a symbol of the new covenant in His blood 1 Cor 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He redeemed us back to God and qualified us to inherit everything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, this new covenant is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In resurrection Christ became the bequests of the new testament and the Mediator, the Executor, to execute the new testament Heb 9:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This implies that Christ is the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose your father gives you a will which says that he will give you ten million dollars and much property.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the will did not have these legal papers, the will would be nothing.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But what if there were no Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then all the bequests in the new testament the will would be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God gave us the Bible as a will, this meant that God gave us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is the centrality and universality as the reality of the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Christ is given, that means He is the covenant.</S>
