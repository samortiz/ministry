God has no intention to ask us to do something for Him. God's intention is for us to take Him as life into us. Then He as our life will work out many things from within us. God's intention is that He could be life to us, but we need to see how we can take Him as life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOSPEL OF JOHN BEING A BOOK OF LIFE</H2><P>The Gospel of John is a book of life. It tells us that Christ came that we may have life and have it abundantly (10:10). John tells us what Christ is and how we can take Christ as life. Christ is many things to us in the book of John, such as the light (8:12), the life, the way (14:6a), the door (10:9), the bread of life (6:35), the living water (4:10, 14), etc. But these are just the items of what Christ is, not the substance, the essence.</P><P>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God." Christ is the Word (v. 14). John also says that this very Christ who is the Word and who is God is Spirit. John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit." We need to combine John 4:24 with 1:1. Christ is God, Christ is the Word, and Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Christ is God as the source, Christ is the Word as the element, and Christ is the Spirit as the essence. So if we are going to take Christ as life, we have to contact the Spirit and the Word. Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for us to take Christ as life.</P><P>Christ is the bread of life, the spiritual food, but you need to contact the Spirit and the Word so that you can get this food. Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for you to take the food. Christ is also the light. If you are going to enjoy the light, you need to contact the Spirit and the Word. Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for you to get the light.</P><P>Christ as the all-inclusive One is the Spirit within us and the Word outside of us. We have the Spirit within and the Word without. These are not two separate things, but two aspects of one thing. This one thing is Christ Himself as God. Within us is the Spirit and outside of us is the Bible, the Word. In this substance, this divine element, are all the items of what Christ is: the life, the light, the food, the water, the air, etc. All are items of the same substance, which is the Spirit, the Word, and God. Christ is God! Christ is the Spirit! And Christ is the Word! We have Christ today as God the Spirit within us and as the Word outside of us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
