THE FOUR PARTICULAR MATTERS<br>IMPLIED IN DEUTERONOMY</H2><P>As we conclude our life-study of Deuteronomy, we would like to point out the four particular matters implied in this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God's Governmental Dealing</H2><P>The first matter implied in Deuteronomy is God's governmental dealing, which is wise, loving, sympathetic, patient, purposeful, and successful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Israel's Stubbornness</H2><P>The second matter implied in this book is Israel's stubbornness, which is versus God's sovereignty for the showing of God's wisdom and for the accomplishing of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Moses' Character</H2><P>The next matter implied in Deuteronomy is Moses' character, which was experienced, matured, loving, caring, faithful, and meek.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ's Uniqueness</H2><P>Fourth, in the book of Deuteronomy Christ's uniqueness is implied. Christ is unique in being the unique Prophet of God as the divine oracle, the unique word as the embodiment of the divine riches, and the unique good land as the divine goal.</P><P>All the words in Deuteronomy&#151;the commandments, laws, ordinances, statutes, judgments, warnings, exhortations, blessings, and curses&#151;are God's breathing, and God's breathing is altogether embodied in Christ. As we read this book, we need to inhale all that God has exhaled, all that He has breathed out. If we do this, we will be enlightened, but this is not the primary matter. What is primary is that by inhaling the divine breath in this book, we will enjoy Christ, the embodiment of the divine breath. The more we receive the breath of the speaking God, the more we will enjoy Christ. We will enjoy Christ as the unique Prophet of God, as the unique word to be our means to accomplish what God requires, and as the unique good land as the divine goal. In this book, Christ is the unique Prophet, the unique word, and the unique goal.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_121.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
