<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE JEWS IN THE HOLY LAND</H2><P>According to a recent report of the Zionists, there are now about one hundred fifty thousand people living in Palestine. Among them twenty-five thousand are farmers, and twenty thousand are laborers. They have introduced commerce and industry, which has been something unknown to this region for more than a few hundred years.</P><P>By their own labor they have built a busy city which has thirty-two thousand inhabitants.</P><P>At present they are developing the commercial port of Haifa and are making it prosperous. They are opening up the ______ Bay, and their farmers are turning the ______ plain into a fertile field. The Jews have also adopted electricity, and places like ______ and ______ have enough electricity to supply light manufacturing work already.</P><P>All these are fulfillments of the Scripture. How we rejoice at seeing God working behind everything for the fulfillment of His purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EGYPT AND PROPHECY</H2><P>Egypt is the center of unrest in the present world. Egypt and England develop conflicts between one another all the time. At the present time, Egypt is still under the control of England. Those who pay attention to the prophecies should pay much attention to the things happening in Egypt. If Daniel 11 is not yet fulfilled, then before the appearing of Antichrist, extraordinary events must take place in Egypt. It will be revived, and it will gather its army to free itself of the British rule, and it will become a strong nation. If this is the case, the present turmoil in Egypt is but a harbinger of the coming events of the last days, and it will hasten the appearance of the coming events. We should pay constant attention to Egypt and Syria.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PREPARING FOR THE APPEARING OF THE ANTICHRIST</H2><P>According to the prophecy in the Bible, the fourth kingdom in the age of the Gentiles will eventually become ten kingdoms and will be ruled by one king. When Rome is revived and is ruled by the last Gentile king, all these prophecies will be fulfilled. This last king will be Antichrist. But how will the ten nations be united together? In the future the northeastern nations of Europe will be united together. Germany, however, will not join this union but will be friendly with the other nations. Russia will at the same time be revived through its turmoils and will become an imperial power. Germany and Russia will be joined together to counteract the allied countries. Their power will reach the East, and they will seize the raw material in the East for their manufacturing industry. China and Japan will join hands with Russia and Germany to counteract the allied countries in an attempt to block them from gaining political and commercial victory in Asia. Hence, the revival of the Roman Empire becomes an indispensable strategy for Europe. The prophecy in Daniel concerning the fourth kingdom will be fulfilled. At present Russia wishes very much to influence the other nations within the boundary of the Roman Empire through its socialistic movements.</P><P>The Jews are developing their finances in Palestine. They have collected thirty million dollars as capital in Jerusalem. The commercial ships travelling between America and Palestine are also collaborating with this work. They will use the mineral wealth of the Dead Sea, estimated to be worth forty billion dollars, for the development of agriculture and the real estate business. The wealth of these people far exceeds the expectation of the economists or the students of prophecy. The Jews in Palestine will become the great bankers of the Middle East. Later, when Palestine is besieged during the Russo-teutonic siege, the accumulated wealth of the Jews will be partly lost (Ezek. 38:10-13).</P>
