   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Jehovah as Jesus Shepherding</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Afflicted of the Flock of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 7 through 11 and 14, we see Jehovah as Jesus shepherding the afflicted of the flock of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 7a says, "I fed the flock of slaughter, and thereby the afflicted of the flock."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The I here refers to Jehovah, as indicated by the previous verse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jehovah as Jesus came to feed His people, who were about to be slaughtered, the afflicted of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 7b through 11 say, "And I took to myself two staffs; one I called Favor, and the other I called Bonds; and I fed the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then I destroyed the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also detested me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then I said, I will not feed you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is to die will die, and what is to be destroyed will be destroyed, and those who are left will each eat one another's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And I took my staff, Favor, and I broke it in pieces so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And it was broken in that day; and thus the afflicted of the flock, who watched me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that Jehovah as Jesus brought two staffs Favor and Bonds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Favor means grace, and Bonds means to be bound into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then Jehovah as Jesus set aside the three shepherds the priests, the elders, and the scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He destroyed them, and their souls detested Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus as the proper Shepherd was rejected, leaving the children of Israel as a flock without any shepherd John 10:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With respect to Israel's being without a shepherd, Matthew 9:36 says, "Seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, He broke the staff, Favor Zech 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that He broke the covenant which God made through Moses, leaving the people without a covenant to cover them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He thus took away the grace Favor .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 14 goes on to say, "Then I broke my second staff, Bonds, in pieces, so as to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the binding love was also taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, the nation was divided and full of inner fighting v. 9 . From the day of Christ's crucifixion, there has not been any oneness among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although those in the northern kingdom, Israel, and the southern kingdom, Judah, were brothers, the brotherhood among them has been broken because the binding love has been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This took place as they were living under the oppression of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. The Messiah, as the Proper Shepherd of Israel,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being Detested, Attacked, Rejected, and Sold</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>for Thirty Pieces of Silver</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Zechariah 11:12 and 13 reveal that the Messiah, as the proper Shepherd of Israel, was detested, attacked, rejected, and sold for thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave Exo 21:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is prophesied here was fulfilled in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus was sold under the reign of the Roman Empire, and He was judged by the Roman rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Zechariah 11:12 and 13 say, "I said to them, If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, do not bother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And Jehovah said to me, Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price that I am priced with by them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter, into the house of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This clearly indicates that Christ was detested, attacked, rejected, and sold.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to understand these verses and know who provided the silver and who threw it into the house of Jehovah, we need to study the four Gospels.</S>
