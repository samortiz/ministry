   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ROME AND RUSSIA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have long conjectured that "the king of the north" Dan 11:28-end would perhaps come from Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we did not know how the Roman emperor would come to terms with the king of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The following fact may shed some light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Italian dictator Mussolini has sent men to communicate with Russia in private.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the matter is not yet apparent, and although there are yet many cover-ups, the matter is enough to cast much light on the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Rome correspondent, Mr. ______ of the English Daily News, wrote on September 30, 1925: "Although I need no further proof than what I have already, which proofs for certain reasons I cannot fully reveal yet, since my last report I have received solid evidence of Mussolini communicating with Russia in private.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moscow is now trying its best to bring about a treaty between the two nations."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Antichrist is about to appear!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, may we be raptured to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Oh, how we desire this day to come soon!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For a number of years, we have been paying attention to the work of the Chinese Society for the Promotion of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I cannot help but issue warnings to the faithful children of God, so that they would know what to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The work of this Society is to prepare the way for the Chinese part of the great Babylon in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Society does not preach the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It uses many beautiful spiritual terms to preach another gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is pitiful that some true believers are deceived by it!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have received its Christmas issue of the China for Christ magazine, and its publication The Family by the Family Committee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Reading these publications makes a person's heart ache.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They say that the Lord Jesus was born to be an example for humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Christmas issue, not a single word was mentioned about the purpose of the Lord's coming to earth being to die for men and for the saving of men's souls, so that men may be saved from perdition and may receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Its Family Committee promotes the so-called "three abstinences," abstinence from prostitution, abstinence from gambling, and abstinence from concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first issue of The Family spoke much about these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But not once did it mention the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not once did it mention the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can a man be saved by abstaining from prostitution, from gambling, and from having concubines?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are there only these three sins in this world?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these things are done because men do not understand the Bible and do not realize God's power!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God says that man can never cause himself to abstain from anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone in the world is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although outwardly a person may be very polished and very clean, nevertheless, this is not inward regeneration, and he is still a man of hell!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We thank the Lord that He has sent His Son to die on the cross for our sins and has given us the Holy Spirit, so that we do not have to be condemned, but will have the newness of life and can go to heaven eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ancient gospel is the only one that saves sinners and that removes sins!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although these things expose their failure, we have to humble ourselves before God, because such things are done by those who call themselves the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be proud of ourselves; we should acknowledge our failures before God and should ask God to revive His own church and prepare the little flock who love Him faithfully to be ready for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In these days men pay much attention to the social gospel that never bears any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May God cause us to faithfully preach the gospel that saves sinners by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers, apostasy is increasing day by day, and we must not have a part in the sins of others.</S>
