   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 26:"For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why take the trouble to gain the whole world, that is, the wealth and glory of the world, yet lose the glory of the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What can we give in exchange for our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Lord's eyes those who save their soul today are the most foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 27:"For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From here on the Lord called Himself mainly the "Son of Man," signifying sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Then" proves that what is mentioned earlier in this passage will take place in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Doings" refers to saving the self today or losing the self for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The doings are the basis for the reward and have nothing to do with the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should take note that this portion is concerned with our doings, not with our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, at the Lord's coming, this is what will happen:</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see two entirely opposite outcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in order to find out whether or not we will receive a reward in the future, we do not need to wait until we come before the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we just need to examine our doings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we lose our soul today, we can be assured that we will gain it in the future; if we gain our soul today, we can also be assured that we will lose it in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 28:"Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON CHAPTER 16</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1 God is most patient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the world says that He is not there, He is not anxious but continues to hide Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 Today's preachers are like actors; they act and advertise, only with the intention of making a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 Foolishness and unbelief are twins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4 We are all "missionaries" here, because we are not citizens of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>5 The Lord's trial before the high priest was indeed very unjust; he asked the Lord if He was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord answered yes, he should have gone on to investigate if such a claim was true or not before making a verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when the high priest heard the Lord's answer, he rent his garments and proclaimed that He had blasphemed, and they pronounced a death sentence upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6 When we read the Bible, we should not seek merely for spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most important thing is that we are God's servants and should know His requirements.</S>
