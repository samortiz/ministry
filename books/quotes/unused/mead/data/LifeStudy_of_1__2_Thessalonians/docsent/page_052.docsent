   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO ASPECTS OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to consider carefully the meaning of faith in 1 Thessalonians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 2 faith is not only subjective, referring to the saints' believing, as in verses 5, 6, and 10, but also objective, referring to what they believe in, as in 1 Timothy 3:9; 4:1; and 2 Timothy 4:7.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two aspects of faith involve each other.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our believing subjective faith is out of the things we believe and in the things we believe objective faith .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word faith in 1 Thessalonians is somewhat difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason for this difficulty is that in the New Testament there are two aspects of faith, the objective aspect and the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Doctrinally speaking, the objective aspect comes first and produces the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The objective faith denotes those things in which we believe for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It includes the content of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the content of the new covenant is equal to the objective faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This aspect of faith is emphasized strongly in a book like 1 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, 1 Timothy 1:19 speaks of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The faith in that verse is objective and refers to the things we believe in. However, the same verse also mentions subjective faith when it speaks of "holding faith and a good conscience." This subjective faith refers to our act of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians often speak of the faith in an objective sense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Someone may ask what your faith is, meaning what you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This aspect of faith, the objective aspect, is not a matter of our action of believing, but a matter of what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This objective faith includes the contents of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we receive a word concerning the objective faith, the contents of God's New Testament economy, spontaneously subjective faith is produced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We respond to the objective faith by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that we hear of the objective faith, and then subjective faith rises up in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This subjective faith is our act of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Subjective faith does not happen once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, from the time we began to believe, the action of believing has been going within us, for the Christian life is a life of faith, a life of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day we are living a believing life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not live according to what we see; we live according to what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As Paul says, "We walk by faith, not by appearance" 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our walk is by faith, not by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the matters we are talking about in these messages are matters of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, Colossians 1:27 says that Christ is in us to be our hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We receive this word in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By faith we believe in His coming back, and by faith we await a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our speaking concerning these things is altogether by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, those who do not have faith do not have any idea of what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To them, our word is either superstitious or nonsensical.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They can neither believe it nor accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Worldly people, unbelievers, do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, they cannot understand what we are saying or the way we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our living is absolutely a life of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The objective aspect of faith is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot say that we are perfect or altogether complete with respect to the objective faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's economy is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The content of His economy is Christ as the all-inclusive and all-extensive One.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is because God's economy is so profound and rich in its content that we dare not say that the objective faith has been perfected among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to see that our objective faith includes the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ as the content of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not yet know this content adequately or realize it fully.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we still need to lay hold of more of the all-inclusive Christ, more of Christ as the content of our objective faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Praise the Lord that this objective faith produces subjective believing!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we receive a revelation concerning Christ, we cannot keep ourselves from believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Faith is spontaneously infused into our being, and we automatically believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unbelievers find it impossible to believe that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We, however, cannot help but believe that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is in us to be our life, our life supply, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have seen a vision of the indwelling Christ, and we have no choice except to believe that He is actually in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because we have seen a revelation regarding the content of God's economy, we cannot help believing in what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have been infused with the ability to believe, and now we have subjective faith, the inward action of believing.</S>
