   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO MAINTAIN THE EATING OF CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In such a good, orderly, and formal church like the church in Ephesus, we need to first overcome the loss of the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second thing we need is to maintain the eating of Christ as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is in the epistle to the Ephesians that the Lord says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God" Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus charged us to overcome the leaving of the first love and to maintain the eating of Christ as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we give the preeminence to Christ in everything and enjoy Him as the tree of life every day, we will be marvelous, overcoming Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we enjoy Christ as the tree of life, we have the Paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The tree of life is first seen in Genesis in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That garden of Eden was the paradise of God at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today our paradise is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have been in the church life for sixty years, starting from 1932, so I have much church life experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do not give the preeminence to the Lord or enjoy the Lord, even for a month, the church life may become an unpleasant place to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, you might not say this, but deep within you would think that there is not much good in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the church is altogether no longer a paradise to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when you overcome the loss of the first love and maintain your eating of Christ, your enjoying of the Lord, right away the church life becomes paradise to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, our sensation and our attitude toward the church depend upon our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we give the Lord the preeminence in everything and enjoy Him as the tree of life throughout the day, right away the church, regardless of its condition, becomes paradise to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why the Lord says that we have to eat the tree of life in the Paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, the Paradise of God in Revelation 2:7 actually refers to the New Jerusalem in the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we enjoy the Lord in this age, we will be rewarded with the eating of the tree of life, Christ Himself, in the New Jerusalem as the Paradise of God in the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to continue in the enjoyment of the life supply of Christ in the present church life so that we can be rewarded with the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, the New Jerusalem, in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the New Jerusalem in its freshness as the Paradise of God, we will participate in full in the enjoyment of the rich life supply of Christ as the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TO SHINE FORTH THE DIVINE LIGHT AS THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to overcome the leaving of the first love, to maintain the eating of Christ as the tree of life, and to shine forth the divine light as the lampstand Rev 2:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Love is related to life, and life is related to light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Love, life, and light are a trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you make Christ the first in everything, you have love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have this love, you have life, and you will enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you have life, this life becomes light to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The light of the lampstand, the church, shines forth corporately versus individualistically in the dark night of the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TO KEEP THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS AS THE SHINING OF THE LAMPSTAND IN THEIR LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are enjoying Christ as our love, life, and light, we will keep the testimony of Jesus as the shining of the lampstand in our locality Rev 12:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will testify of Christ's person as God and as man and of Christ's human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and second appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The shining of the light is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In every aspect of our daily life, we should be shining forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shining is the shining of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to remember these four words that begin with the letter "l" love, life, light, and lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These four "l" words start with love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must give the Lord Jesus the preeminence in every way and in everything to recover the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will enjoy Him as the tree of life, and this life right away becomes the light of life John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we will be shining in our daily life and corporately as the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Otherwise, the lampstand will be removed from us individually and from the church corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord warned the church in Ephesus to repent and recover the first love for the enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, the lampstand would be removed from them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need love, life, light, and the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we will be rewarded by the Lord with what we are and live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Bible, the principle is that our reward is always what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What we are will become our reward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we love others, our loving others will be a reward to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we honor our parents, our honor to them will be a reward to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do not live Christ and behave in Christ in the church life, there will be nothing as a reward to us in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, because we do not live Christ, we may feel bitter toward the elders and toward all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we live Christ and behave in Christ, this living, this behaving, will become our reward.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we will be happy in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If today we take Christ as the first in everything, we will have love, we will enjoy Him as life, we will shine forth with Him as light, and we will become the shining lampstand as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This eventually will become our reward not only in this age but even more in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the thousand-year kingdom we will enjoy Christ as our reward in the Paradise of God.</S>
