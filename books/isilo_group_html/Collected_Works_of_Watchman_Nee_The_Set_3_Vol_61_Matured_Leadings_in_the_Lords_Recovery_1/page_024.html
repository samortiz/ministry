Our Christian confession is our primary profession; this is not something that we do on the side. What does it mean to have our Christian confession as our primary profession? First, we have to be absolute for the Lord and His gospel. "Christians" in Greek is Christianos, which means those who attach themselves to Christ, who follow Christ wholeheartedly. I hope that all of us will be men who give themselves wholeheartedly to the gospel. If we all have the same interest, every problem will be easily solved.</p><p>In order to take the Christian confession as our primary profession, we need a practical consecration. Consecration cannot be words in our mouth only; we must take some practical steps. At Pentecost there was the fact of consecration without any preaching of a message on consecration. The apostles only preached Jesus Christ as Lord; they did not speak about consecration. Yet, as a result, the believers shared everything in common. They sold their lands and distributed to everyone according to his need because they had a pattern of the gospel to follow (Acts 2:44-45). The apostles were men who had given up everything. The ones they brought to the Lord also became men of consecration, even though they did not hear messages on consecration. We all aspire to have the power of the gospel like the apostles, but we neglect the fact that they were men who had forsaken all.</p><p>There is also the need of one accord. If everyone is fully for the Lord and the gospel, can anything break the one accord? If two persons are not in one accord, they cannot walk together (Amos 3:3). However, it is not a simple thing to be in one accord. We know that the church in Philippi comforted and encouraged Paul because it strove together with one soul in the faith of the gospel (Phil. 1:27). Yet even among those believers, there were problems. Paul had to exhort two leading sisters to be of one mind (4:2). This shows that they were not in one accord very much. In the beginning of Acts we see a hundred and twenty people praying in one accord for ten days. We should not think that this was a simple thing. It was a very difficult task. This is the reason the Lord Jesus asked the Father before He departed from the world to make us one (John 17:21). The apostles also charged us to be diligent to keep the oneness (Eph. 4:3-6). The principle of the gospel is for five to chase a hundred and for a hundred to chase ten thousand (Lev. 26:8). The one accord will bring in the impact of the gospel. Actually, only those who are truly consecrated can be in one accord. Consecration is to pour out one's very heart. Where our treasure is, there our heart is as well (Matt. 6:21). If a man pours himself out, will he still insist on any opinion of his own? Those who are truly consecrated will be in one accord, and their gospel will spontaneously be powerful.</p><p>Today there are two kinds of systems in the world. One is capitalism, and the other is communism. Capitalism protects private ownership; everyone can accumulate wealth for himself. Communism practices the sharing of all things in common. No one has any private possessions, and everyone gives up everything for the good of the state. The communist way appears to be similar to the Christian way, but it does not have the life of God, and it is not easy to carry out this practice. D. M. Panton wrote about democracy and socialism in one of his expositional writings. In the image in Daniel, the ten toes are made of iron and clay. Panton interpreted the iron as referring to dictatorship which will "stiffen up" to become fascism. The clay refers to democracy which will degenerate into communism. Therefore, clay refers to the communist party today. Since the time of Martin Luther, the Brethren have been the champions of orthodox interpretations of the image in Daniel, telling us that iron refers to dictatorship while clay refers to democracy. Prior to the Brethren, interpretations on the iron and clay focused on the incompatibility of the mixture. Other teachers emphasized their interrelatedness. For example, G. H. Lang said that dictatorship brings in democracy, while democracy in turn creates dictatorship. The clay of democracy is too weak to meet the challenges of crises, and so power goes to the hand of a few or even one person. The result is a fascist dictatorship or communist autocracy. An example of the former is Napoleon during the French Revolution, and an example of the latter is the Soviet Union which evolved into communism from the instability of democracy. Mr. Panton is the first person to interpret clay to mean communism. Communism extols sharing all things in common. Karl Marx borrowed this concept from Acts. It would be a shame to Christians if one day the communists would turn around to teach Christians about sharing all things in common, selling everything and distributing to everyone according to his need. A proper Christian does not accumulate riches for himself; rather, he forsakes everything to take the Christian confession as his primary profession.</p><p>In Acts, first we have the twelve apostles and then one hundred twenty people. Later three thousand and then five thousand people were saved. The ones who were saved followed the example of the twelve apostles. Spontaneously they forsook everything. When a new one is saved and comes to the church, he sees that everyone around him has forsaken everything to follow the Lord. If he does not follow, he will feel uneasy; he may even feel that he is a dropout. Therefore, in order for our next generation to forsake everything, we must take the lead to sell our all. Otherwise, our gospel will only be a pat on others' shoulders; it will amount to nothing but a few nice words.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
