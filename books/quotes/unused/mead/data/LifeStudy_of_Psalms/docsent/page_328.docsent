   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. CHARGING THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO SERVE JEHOVAH IN HIS HOUSE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE COURTS OF HIS HOUSE, TO PRAISE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The subject of Psalm 135 is the charging of the priests who serve Jehovah in His house, in the courts of His house, to praise Him for His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This psalm could have been written only by someone who was close to the Lord and concerned for the Lord's interest and for the serving priests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that the writer of this psalm was not a priest but a common citizen among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because he was close to the Lord and because he had an intimate concern for the worship of God and for the priests, he charged the priests to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle is the same in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have co-workers, full-timers, and full-time trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certain of the saints among us in the church who are very close to the Lord may be concerned for all these ones, watch over them, and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For instance, a particular co-worker is serving the Lord full-time, but he may not be very desperate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of the older saints, bothered about the situation, may then pray for this co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. In His Goodness</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Praise the name of Jehovah;/Praise Him, you servants of Jehovah,/Who stand in the house of Jehovah,/In the courts of the house of our God./Praise Jehovah, for Jehovah is good;/Sing psalms to His name, for it is pleasant" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the priests are charged to praise God in His goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. In Choosing Jacob for Himself,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Israel for His Personal Treasure</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"For Jehovah has chosen Jacob for Himself,/Israel for His personal treasure" v. 4 . Isaac had two sons: Esau, the well-behaved one, and Jacob, the naughty one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaac chose Esau, who did things to please him, but God chose Jacob for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's economy needed this naughty one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without him, God's economy could not be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 4 says not only that God chose Jacob for Himself but also that He chose Israel for His personal treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Jacob was transformed into Israel, the prince of God, he became God's personal treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God chose Jacob for Himself, but He chose Israel for His treasure.</S>
