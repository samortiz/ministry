   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have fellowship with the Lord in our daily life, we shall be in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the light we see our sinfulness, and we realize that we are wrong in many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may see that we are not right with our husband or wife or with our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in the light we confess our sins to the Lord, and we enjoy the cleansing of the Lord s precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to experience Christ in a practical way as our Redeemer in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Experiencing the Lord like this in our daily living, we should then come to the church meetings in our spirit and either offer a prayer or give a testimony of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our testimony we may say, Dear saints, recently I was enlightened in my fellowship with God, and I saw that I was wrong in many matters and with certain persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I confessed everything to the Lord, and He cleansed me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now I enjoy Him as my Redeemer and also as my sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to offer Christ in the meeting as our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the way to worship God in our spirit with the Christ whom we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we continue to fellowship with the Lord in the light, we may realize that we should be absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we are not absolute for God, and of ourselves we cannot be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the course of our fellowship we may be further enlightened of the Spirit to realize that because we cannot be absolute for God, we need Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the absolute One, and we need Him as our life so that we can live a life that is absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spontaneously we may pray, Lord Jesus, I cannot be absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But I thank You, Lord, that You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are absolute for God, and I believe that You can live such an absolute life for me and in me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, I take You as my burnt offering to be my absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After you experience the Lord in this way, you may come to the church meeting with your experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the meeting you may offer up a prayer in which you present Christ to God as your burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In such a prayer you may say, Lord Jesus, I should be absolute for God, but in myself I cannot be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, I thank You that You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When You lived on earth, You were absolute for God, and now You are the One in me who is absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord Jesus, You are my burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to worship God in spirit with the Christ you experience as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In your daily life, you may also experience Christ as the One feeding you with Himself as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is to experience Christ as your meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because you experience Christ in this way, You may come to the church meeting with Christ as your meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then either in prayer or in testimony you may speak concerning Christ as your daily food, as your meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we experience Christ as the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering, then we shall also experience Him as our peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The peace offering is based upon and constituted of the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we experience Christ as these four offerings, certainly we shall enjoy Him as our peace with God and also as our peace with others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose a brother does not have peace in his married life and family life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he experiences Christ as the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering, he will also experience Christ as peace with his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then this brother will be able to come to the church meetings with joy, and praise the Lord for being his peace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will also be able to testify to the entire universe, including the angels and demons, that he is a peaceful person, a person enjoying peace to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He will be able to testify that he has peace with God, with those in his family, with the Body, and even with everything in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we become angry with the situation in our family life or in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason for this anger is that we are lacking in the experience of Christ, and, as a result, we do not have Christ as our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if we experience Christ daily as our sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, and meal offering, we shall have Christ as our peace in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then in the meetings of the church we shall be able to offer Christ as our peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we come to the church meetings to worship God, we need to worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should also worship God with the very Christ whom we experience day by day, with the Christ who has become our personal reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the sight of God, the Christ who is our personal reality is also our personal virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have the highest human virtue, yet this virtue is not of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, this virtue is the sweetness of the Christ whom we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the Christ whom we experience daily becomes our personal virtue, with which we can offer God a pleasant, acceptable worship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we come to worship God with such a Christ, God is happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps now we can understand that in the New Testament truth is not only the Triune God, the Word of God, the contents of the faith, and the reality concerning God, man, and the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Truth is also the genuineness, truthfulness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness, and faithfulness of God as a divine virtue and of man as a human virtue and as an issue of the divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to this understanding of truth, this divine virtue first belongs to God, and then through our experience of Christ this virtue also becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the divine virtue is experienced by us, it becomes our virtue, a virtue that is an issue of the divine reality.</S>
