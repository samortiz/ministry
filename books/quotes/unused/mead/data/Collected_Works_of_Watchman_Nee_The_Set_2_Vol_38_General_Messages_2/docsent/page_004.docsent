   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE WORK OF GOD Scripture Reading: John 6:28-29; Eph 2:10; Gal 1:11-12, 16; 1 Cor 3:9-15 MAN CANNOT WORK THE WORKS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 6:28 a group of people asked the Lord Jesus what they should do that they might work the works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were zealous for God and wanted to do God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But they did not know what it was to work the works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They thought that once they knew what to do, they could do it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once the question of "what to do" was settled, they thought that they could engage themselves in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The question of whether or not they could actually do the work was not part of their consideration at all; they only needed to know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see man's desire to participate in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He feels that he can work God's work; he thinks that his ability is great enough to take up God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Lord's answer was entirely different from man's question.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said, "This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent" v. 29 . While man boasted of what he could do, the Lord replied that man ought to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man's trying to do something means that he wants to prove his ability; man's believing means that he acknowledges his inability to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Believing is receiving John 1:12 , and believing into the One whom God sent means believing into the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no question of human merit or human ability.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man cannot do anything; God has done it all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All that man needs to do is receive, stretch out his hand, and take in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Faith signifies that God has done all the work; He has given us His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need for man to do anything; all he has to do is accept what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOD HAVING WORKED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following this the Lord said, "This is the work of God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ignorant ones thought that they could work the works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were zealous and trying to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Lord told them that the work of God is to believe into Him whom God has sent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not what man has done for God but what God has done Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the work of God and not the work of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For man to believe in the Lord Jesus is a work of God; it is not something that man does but something that God does.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's work can only be done by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man cannot work God's work; he has no part in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consider the story of Martha and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It serves as a good illustration of our point.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Martha was busily serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She did a great deal of work and was so busy that she asked the Lord to send her sister over to help her.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps she thought that by expending so much effort, paying such a price, and suffering so much hardship she would be considered as having served the Lord and having done some work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet the Lord did not praise her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead He said, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; but there is need of one thing, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her" Luke 10:41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What had Mary done?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible says that Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sitting and listening do not constitute a work at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She was not as busy as her sister; she was quietly sitting at the Lord's feet and drawing near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Listening to His word is receiving His word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's word is spirit and life, and He dispenses life to men through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mary was receiving the Lord's word and affording Him the opportunity to operate on her.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She was giving the Lord the opportunity to dispense Himself into her through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mary was just a receiving vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The One doing the work was the Lord, not Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She, the person, was the work of the Lord; she was the object of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ephesians 2:10 says, "We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord that we are not the work of man but the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's work is fully trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Oh, what a glorious fact that we are the work of God!</S>
