   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to Sister X in Christ:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am sure that the loving, merciful Father has given you and all the brothers His rich, unsearchable, marvelous, indescribable grace through the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May He abundantly give you even more in the future so that all the glory might be to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After meeting in Han-Jiang for a few days, I moved to another house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God had prepared a comfortable place for me to give hospitality to a few sisters so they could get to know the life of prayer and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sister Chen Wan-ching wants to come to western Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May God fulfill her desire according to His best choice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything goes on as usual with me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank the Father God for His abounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May God quickly accomplish His purpose through the work of faithful workers and the hastening of the saints' prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the Father's kingdom come!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your little sister in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Bao Hsu-min</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>February 22</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Three</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank you!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I will go to Sien-You County with Sister Wang Yu-ju on the eighteenth of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the twenty-first, the Lord willing, we will begin a sisters' conference that will last a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Afterward, Sister Wang will go someplace else, and I will be able to stay there for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to my recent observation and the condition of the need, it seems that only a few days of meetings would short-change the sisters too much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there were more time, it might give God the opportunity to move His arm in this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I was in Han-Jiang for more than a month and met with the sisters before God many times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There was much blessing on this work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If possible, I would like to do the same thing in Sien-You.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Personally, I have had a particular experience recently: I can work, but I cannot rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I stop working, it seems that some weakness or illness will come!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I force myself to go on as usual, even if it seems painful, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I personally feel that 1 the days are short, and the Lord's coming is near, so we must hurry to repay our debt every day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are finished, we can go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2 Since life overcomes death, and there is Romans 8:11, we would offend our gracious Lord if we did not try to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3 Since the past is gone, the future will soon be gone too.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not know whether or not this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is there any danger?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please pray for this and give me some instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peace and health in the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is already the testimony of a local church in Sien-You with more than fifty brothers and sisters serving the Lord in one accord.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Glory to Him forever and ever!</S>

   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The meeting hall in Fu-Ching has moved out of Luke Hospital and back to its old address 65 Shan-Chiao Street, Fu-Ching .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The coastal region of Fukien has been preserved in peace by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the Lord cause me to live a godly, proper life during these times of peace so that I do not make allowance for the lusts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I will tell you the rest later.</S>
