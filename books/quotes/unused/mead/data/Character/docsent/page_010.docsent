   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MATTER OF EDUCATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the very least, one who wishes to be used by God must certainly receive some education.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult for an unlearned person who has not developed his mind through education to be useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being educated is a condition that we must fulfill in order for God to use us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we all seem to acknowledge this fact, I still need to add a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have not paid adequate attention to language learning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In principle, we all should have considered this when we were young.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, there are some who cannot read reference materials in foreign languages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Students of the sciences used to be required to read German because most of the scientific publications were in that language.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not that they liked to speak German; rather, they needed to research the scientific materials in German.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Similarly, throughout church history spiritual materials were written either in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or English.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To use these reference materials, you must know these languages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, the young people should study Hebrew, Greek, and English.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They need to study some of these languages in order to use the reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, I have discovered from the writings of some brothers and sisters that even their Chinese is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, our language need not be complex or elegant but simply understandable and expressive of our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This matter also affects our usefulness in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers and sisters, if you can use a reference book in Greek, read English, and write fluently in Chinese, you will see how much your usefulness will multiply in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regretfully, you have not paid attention to this and have wasted much time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a rule you should spend one hour each day studying a language.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a year you will be able to use reference materials in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Similar proficiency in Greek will require only half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you spend an hour a day studying English, you will be able to do translation work in three years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since it is more difficult to translate from Chinese to English, an ability to translate from English to Chinese will be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not build ourselves up in such matters, we reduce our usefulness in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this is still not my point.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My point is actually character development, a matter which I fear many have ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE MEANING OF CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we speak of a person s character, it is difficult to say whether it is a matter of the spirit, the soul, or the body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, it involves all three.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For instance, laziness is a problem of character.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some may say that it is a matter of habit; actually, it is a matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is it the spirit that is lazy, or is it the soul or the body?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is difficult to say.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spirit, the soul, and the body are all lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a problem of character.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consider another example: some people are so sloppy that they confuse the book of Mark with the book of Matthew and the book of Matthew with Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we ask them how many chapters there are in the Gospel of Matthew, they will answer that there are sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While some people are this careless, others take things most seriously and perform their work meticulously.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are all matters of character.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I agree that a person who does not have a strong spirit is of little use in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The same is true of one who lacks a strong mind and a clear understanding, and of one who is weak physically.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to be built up in our spirit, soul, and body before we can be useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, what we are discussing here concerns neither the spirit, nor the soul, nor the body, but character.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If your character is deficient, you will not be of much use in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What then is character?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the way you behave as a person, plus the person behind such behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person s character is his disposition which has become his way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have mentioned that character is composed of two things: inborn nature and acquired habits.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A newborn child has only an inborn nature, not acquired habits.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But you and I have both.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may say that nature is the skeleton and habits are the flesh and the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Together, they form one s character.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we send a Chinese child to America as soon as he is born, when he grows up he will be full of American temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can see from this that a person s acquired habits are more influential than his inborn nature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When our inborn nature combined with our acquired habits become the way we live, the result is our character.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our character affects our usefulness to God more than our spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I began to serve the Lord, I did not understand this matter, and it did not seem important.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In helping the brothers and sisters, I would merely tell them to study the Bible diligently, pray much, and be dealt with before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I still admit that these points definitely have their usefulness and place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But I have seen persons who prayed, studied the Bible, and pursued the Lord fervently who were not of much use to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the past I noticed only the result but not the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now I have discovered the nullifying factor: a faulty character prevents such persons from being useful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their character has canceled the effectiveness of their Bible study and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Dear brothers and sisters, neither your spirit, nor your soul, nor your body can replace you; nearly your whole being exists in your character.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Allow me to say that, because your character is deficient, merely to have a strong spirit is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I once knew a sister and was quite familiar with her situation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She loved the Lord very much, pursued after Him, and spent time in prayer, Bible reading, and meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nevertheless, one could not find much usefulness in her.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Previously I was perplexed by this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Gradually I found out that it was due to an undeveloped character.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although she could pray in her room for one to two hours, and pray in a good way, once she began to take care of business, meet people, and deal with things, she was altogether sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When she conversed with others, what she spoke usually differed from what she thought.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then, when asked, she inevitably denied that she had spoken a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Did she intentionally lie, or did she purposely deceive?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No, that was simply her way of behaving.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Please consider, could God use a person with such a character?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No, absolutely not.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now we see what character is and how character is related to our usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Please remember that God does not use what is of you in His work, but He needs you as His means to work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you are not thus qualified, God cannot use you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Let me give you another small example, something which I have observed many times.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I asked a brother to take a letter to another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After a few days I met him again and asked him whether he had delivered the message.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He replied, Oh, I completely forgot.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Do not think that this is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It reveals his condition as well as his character.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In principle, a person whose character has been dealt with and built up will first consider his own ability to do a job before he accepts a request.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If he cannot do it, he will not accept the request; but if he is able, he will do it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Either I should refuse a request, or I should accept it and carry it out, even if I must go to hell to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Do you think God can entrust anything to a person who will accept a request carelessly, but who will not fulfill his word afterwards?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Can God entrust him with His work?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In other words, can such a person receive God s commission or God s leading?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Not at all.</S>
