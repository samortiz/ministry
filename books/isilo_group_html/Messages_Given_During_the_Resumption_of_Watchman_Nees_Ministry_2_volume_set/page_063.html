In dealing with our conscience, we need God to give us the wisdom so that we take care of matters in a proper way. The principle of dealing with our conscience is that in our dealings God would gain the glory, others would receive the benefit, and we would be edified. We need wisdom especially in dealing with matters related to adultery. There are some things which cannot be dealt with, and we can only ask God for His forgiveness. We must not pursue peace in our conscience to the extent that it would cause damage to others. There are certain things that cannot be dealt with, and we should not try to deal with them. These matters are over once they have been put under the blood. It is true that we have to be faithful in dealing with the conscience. But sometimes we can go too far. When we realize that we have gone too far, we should stop. Sometimes, it is not God who is telling us to deal with the matters, but Satan who is telling us to do it. The principle of Satan is to hold us back initially and to keep us from advancing. When he cannot hold us back any longer, he will try to push us forward and make us go to the extreme. Sometimes, in the matter of confession, time is a big factor. With some matters, it is wrong to deal with them too early, and it is wrong to deal with them too late. In all these matters, we need the Lord to grant us the wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Confession Needed Especially for Our Speaking</H2><P>One area that we have to make confessions in all the time is in the matter of speaking inaccurate words. This is particularly true with us who are speaking for the Lord. We do not know how many times we have to make confessions in this matter. We have to ask God to send His angels to guard our mouths. Psalm 19:14 says, "Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord." For a long time, this was my daily prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING SENSITIVE IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE LORD</H2><P>In order to maintain our fellowship with the Lord, we have to be sensitive to His calling. Sometimes the Lord calls us to fellowship with Him. If we do not come to Him, and if we wait until it is too late, we may find that the Lord has left. This kind of people will suffer the punishment of being cut off from the fellowship with the Lord. They have to suffer much punishment before they can come to Him again and meet Him once more. In the matter of fellowship, the Lord is not under our control. This is why we have to be sensitive in our response to Him.</P><P>The Lord shows us in the Gospel of John that He is never under man's control. In John 4, the Lord asked the disciples to buy food, but when the food came, He did not eat it. In chapter six, the Lord Jesus knew very well how to take care of the crowd, yet He asked the disciples what to do. In chapter seven, the Lord's brothers wanted to go to Jerusalem, but He would not go. After a while, He Himself went. In chapter eleven, Lazarus was sick, and Jesus remained in the same place for another two days. After Lazarus died, He went. When there was hope, He would not go. When the hope was gone, He went. In all these cases in John, the Lord's intention was to train the disciples to know that the Lord had His timings; He wanted the disciples to know His timings. In chapter eleven, when the Lord came late, although Martha did not blame Him, she did murmur. She did not realize that the Lord had His own timing. What the Lord wants us to learn is to accept His timing in all things, to allow Him to be the Lord, and to fellowship with Him. Even when something appears to be unreasonable outwardly, He wants us to submit to Him. Only by doing this will we be able to go on with the Lord.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
