   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO BE A BUILDING MEMBER OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen both the ministry of the Lord Jesus and the ministry of the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the saints as the members.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By Growth in Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all must realize that as members of the Body of Christ we must care for two things: first we need growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is basic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without growth in life, the building of the Body is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today's Christianity gives people the wrong impression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most Christians feel that since they have a good pastor with several competent assistants, they need do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But for a proper church life, every member must grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Peter 2:2, Ephesians 2:21, and Ephesians 4:15 are scriptures which indicate that the building up of the church is possible only by the growth of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church building is not a composition of so many bricks or dead stones; it is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not grow, there is no possibility for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot merely use the term "church" and have a proper church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regardless of the name or the label, without the growth of life we are dead and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The proper church life depends on the proper growth of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must first deal with our sins, our worldliness, and our self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must experience the cross of Christ and know Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must live in the spirit, maintaining a constant living contact with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we will have a certain amount of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is by such growth that the building of the church exists, and it is in such a way that we will have the real New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reality is in the life, not in the label!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Growing up unto maturity is the first requirement of all the saints for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By Function in Life</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second requirement of each member is that he must minister; he must function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say that you are not a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, we are all ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You certainly must admit that you are a member.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If so, then consider your own body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is there any member of your body which does not function?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must realize that we are members of the Body of Christ, and that as such we must learn how to function.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you say that you do not know how to function or that you cannot function, it is possibly due to the fact that you have not grown.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The function of the members depends entirely on their growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a member is not able to function, that member is either unhealthy or underdeveloped.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the local saints must actively function in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE MATERIALS FOR GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we must carefully consider another important point.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us read 1 Corinthians 3:9-15: "For we are God's fellow-workers: ye are God's husbandry, God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; each man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If any man's work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we function or serve in the church, we must always remember that there are two categories of materials: one consists of gold, silver, and precious stones; the other is composed of wood, hay, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be exceedingly careful not to function with materials from the second category.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On one hand we must learn to function, but on the other hand we must learn to discern the materials we use in functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Gold speaks of the nature of God, silver of the redemptive work of Christ, and precious stones of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are the three items of the work of the three persons of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can only gain these three precious materials through the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus we must function only by the cross and through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Wood represents the human nature, and hay and stubble represent the things of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn to reject and deny all the human elements, all the things of this earth, by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Apostle Paul said that he was the wise masterbuilder who laid the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But all the saints, including all the gifted persons, must be clear how to build.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The ministry of gold, silver, and precious stones will be a real building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If, however, we bring in wood, hay, and stubble, we will greatly damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must learn to check ourselves by the cross in the way we function.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church we must always act by the way of the cross.</S>
