   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All who believe in Christ were in the house at the time of their conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But shortly thereafter, as far as their practical daily experience is concerned, many came out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In their experience, not many Christians stay in the house after their conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that when they believed in Christ and were saved, they entered into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But then they began to do many things apart from the house and outside of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that they did things outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has been the experience of many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We entered into Christ when we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in our effort to please God by ourselves, we came out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We did not remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we came to the church, we were brought back into the house through the ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who came into the church life still may not be in Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a source of trouble in the church Everyone in the church should be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, there may arise an abnormal condition wherein many who are in the church life are not abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before coming into the church life you may have struggled in your own energy to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now that you have come into the church, which is part of the house, you need also to come back into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that you need to come back to Christ and remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were all saved in Christ But, like the Galatians, we may try to go on apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, we must be brought back to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no need for us to do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should simply maintain our identification with Christ, with a constant realization that we are nothing and that He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to see that we are in Him and that He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as we abide in Him, He will abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Lord Himself said in John 15, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may have heard this teaching before they came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The crucial matter, however, is not whether or not you know the teaching about abiding in Christ; it is whether or not you are actually abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where are you at this very moment?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are you in Christ, or are you apart from Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus said that apart from Him we can do nothing John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To remain in the house is to abide in Christ and to be identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, it is to remain in oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The greatest problem among believers today is that in their experience, they are outside of Christ, apart from the oneness with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moses charged the children of Israel to eat the lamb in the house and then to stay in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they had come out of the house, they would have lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the house they had the full enjoyment of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only in the house could the Passover become their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be clear concerning what the house is and where the house is today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have emphasized the fact that the house is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But where is the house?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The house is where there is the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The unique sign of the house is not what we are, have, or do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the sprinkled blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where redemption is, there Christ is also.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Apart from redemption, we have no standing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our unique standing is the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you read the book of Galatians, you will see that the Galatians had been distracted from the standing of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They had come out of the house and were thus deprived of the benefit, the profit, of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the children of Israel had not remained in the house, they would have been deprived of the benefit, profit, enjoyment, and experience of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To participate in the Passover there was the need to remain in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we are saved, we need to remain in the very place where we have been redeemed, in the place where the blood has been sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here in this place we have the house.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The redeeming blood keeps us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever we try in our own energy to do something for God, we violate the principle of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The principle of redemption is that there is no need for us to do anything other than to exercise our hyssop, our faith, to apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever our hyssop applies the blood to the gate, the way is open for us to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us remain in the place of redemption, in the house with the blood-sprinkled entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not practice those things which cause us to come out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, we should stay in the house where we participate in the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The longer we remain in the house, the more light we receive; and the more light we receive, the more we see that everything we need is in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we stay in the house, we will be filled, qualified, equipped, and formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our only need is to remain in Christ as the house.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I was young, I heard a number of messages on the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All these messages emphasized the one point that when God sees the blood, He passes over us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A well-known gospel song even uses the words from Exodus 12:13, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But in all these messages I heard on the Passover, not a word was spoken about remaining in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only twice are we told that when God sees the blood, He will pass over us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But time after time Moses spoke of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you are enlightened by the Lord, you may realize that even now, in your experience, you are outside of the house, outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The only way to get into the house is through the redeeming blood sprinkled on the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is impossible to separate the redeeming blood from the house, for the blood and the house are one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever we maintain the standing of the redeeming blood, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, when we endeavor in our natural energy to please God, we leave the standing of the redeeming blood and are outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do you know what the children of Israel were doing inside the house?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They were eating the flesh of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Exodus 12:14 indicates that they were feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This verse says, "And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah throughout your generations" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What does it mean to have a feast to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It means that we remain in the house and enjoy a full participation in the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this way we feast on the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But the Lord enjoys this feast more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To have a feast unto Him means that we feast for Him and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We eat, but He enjoys.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We feast, and He is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The more we feast, the more enjoyment He has and the happier He is.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, the more we endeavor to do things, the more displeased He becomes, for our endeavors do not give Him any enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What a poor situation there is in today's Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Most Christians are outside of the house trying to do things for the Lord; they are not in the house feasting unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Praise Him that we in the local churches are in the house feasting unto the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This principle of staying in the house by keeping the standing of redemption must govern our whole Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All day long we, the redeemed ones, should remain in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When some hear this, they may point out that the children of Israel left the house in order to make their exodus out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, the time they spent in the house signifies the full course of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As we remain in the house feasting on the Passover lamb, we are equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Actually, the feasting is the equipping.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When the children of Israel were filled with the Passover lamb, they were ready to march out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hence, they were equipped by being filled with the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is the reason we say that remaining in the house involves the full course of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Do not think that the blood sprinkled on the lintel and the door posts is sufficient for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is sufficient to usher us into the house and to keep us from the judgment of God, but it is not sufficient to equip us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It cannot enable us to make the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>For this, we need to roast the lamb, eat its flesh in the house hastily, and be filled with the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Every part of the Passover lamb must be eaten, including the head, the legs, and the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Nothing should be left over.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Perhaps the children of Israel had to encourage one another to eat certain parts of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Some may not have cared for the inward parts or the head, but nevertheless they had to eat the whole lamb in order to be fully equipped for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>As we feast on Christ as the Passover lamb, God is happy and full of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then He can say, "Satan, look at My people.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>They are being equipped by feasting on the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Because they are being equipped in this way, they will be able to defeat you."</S>
