<h1 class="title">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECULAR WORLD AND THE RELIGIOUS WORLD</h2>
<p>The Bible shows us that there are two different kinds of worlds. The term <em>the world</em> usually refers to the universe composed of the heavens and earth created by God for His purpose and corrupted by Satan to oppose God. Everything created by God has been utilized by Satan to frustrate God&rsquo;s purpose. After man became fallen through Satan&rsquo;s corruption, God came in to call a people unto Himself, and He gave them His holy Word, the Bible. However, Satan utilized the Bible to form another kind of world. Most people, even many Christians, do not see this second kind of world. Yet the Bible clearly reveals that in addition to the secular world there is another world&mdash;the religious world. The secular world has fallen away from and even denies God. The religious world tries to worship God and even please God, but it does so without Christ or the Spirit.</p>
<p>When Christ was incarnated, He came first to the religious world (Mark 1:21; Luke 4:16). However, the religious world did not receive Christ but instead rejected Him. Eventually, the Sanhedrin, which was the supreme court of Judaism, the religious world, sentenced Christ to death (Matt. 26:59, 66). Then they demanded that the Roman Empire, the secular world, execute their sentence (27:1-2, 20). This shows the nature of the religious world.</p>
<p>I recently went to speak at a conference in Germany. While abroad, I took the opportunity to visit several religious centers in Europe and the Middle East with a group of saints. When we went to Rome and saw all the religious tradition, superstition, and falsehood, we were stirred up to stand against religion. In Saint Peter&rsquo;s Basilica we saw that the foot of a statue of Peter had been worn down by people kissing it. Then we went to Switzerland, which has Protestant religious centers in cities such as Zurich, Neuch&#226;tel, and Geneva. Protestants initially rejected the images of Catholicism, but now in these centers there are large statues of John Calvin and other reformers. Then we went to Israel. No other part of the earth is as religiously dark as Jerusalem. In the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus is said to have been buried and resurrected, under one roof there are separate sections for the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Egyptian Coptic, Ethiopian Orthodox, and Syriac Orthodox churches. I sensed that many demons were dwelling among all the superstitious things in that building. In Jerusalem we also visited the Dome of the Rock, which is the third holiest site in Islam. In both Rome and Jerusalem we saw nothing but darkness and falsehood. Even Bethlehem and Nazareth were full of superstition.</p>
<p>God gave man only one Bible. After seeing all these religious centers, I considered how many different religions man has made from one Bible. There is Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Furthermore, today in Protestantism there are many small &ldquo;daughters.&rdquo; Another religion, Islam, is based on the Koran, which is a counterfeit of the Bible. The earth today is filled with religion. Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam are the same in principle&mdash;they worship God, yet they lack God, Christ, and the Spirit and are instead full of forms, traditions, and superstitions. For those who fear God and seek God, the religious world is a much greater problem than the secular world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE BEING THE RELIGIOUS WORLD</h2>
<p>The book of Galatians deals with the religious world. Galatians 1:4 says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.&rdquo; The religious world has different sections, which are different ages. There is the ancient age of the religious world, the present age of the religious world, and the coming age of the religious world. Thus, when the apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Galatians, he called the religious age in which he was living the present evil age.</p>
<p>In 6:14 and 15 Paul says, &ldquo;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.&rdquo; The word <em>for</em> at the beginning of verse 15 indicates that what follows will explain the previous verse. Thus, the mention of circumcision in verse 15 means that the world in verse 14 is the religious world. &ldquo;The present evil age&rdquo; in Galatians 1:4 and &ldquo;the world&rdquo; in 6:14 both refer to the religious world.</p>
<p>The Gospels show that Christ came first to the religious world and that the religious world opposed Him and sentenced Him to death. Following this, Acts and the Epistles show that it was mainly the religious world that persecuted the apostles. Paul preached the pure gospel, but the religious world brought in mixture through the Judaizers. The churches in Galatia were troubled and frustrated by the confusion brought in by the religious world. Therefore, Paul wrote the Epistle to the Galatians to deal with the religious world.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST MINISTERING OUTSIDE OF RELIGION AND BEING OPPOSED BY RELIGION</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was thirty years of age, He came out to minister. One day He went to a little house in Bethany, where He had intimate fellowship with His disciples (Matt. 26:6-13). While He was in that house, the priests were offering sacrifices and burning incense to God in the temple. According to Jewish history and the Scriptures, the temple was the house of God and the location of the altar, the priesthood, and many other things ordained by God. To most people at that time, it would seem that God was in the temple. However, Christ, who is God incarnate, was in a little house in Bethany.</p>
<p>After the Lord had been ministering for some time, He took His disciples far from the holy temple and the holy city, close to the border of the Holy Land, to a place called Caesarea Philippi, to give them a revelation of Christ and the church (16:13-18). Then the Lord brought three disciples to Mount Hermon, where He was transfigured (17:1-2). After visiting Jerusalem on my recent trip, I went with a group of saints to see the Sea of Galilee, Mount Hermon, and Caesarea Philippi. We all agreed that the Lord was right to bring His followers out of the heavy, dark religious atmosphere in Jerusalem. When I was young, I was taught that Jesus ministered in Galilee because He was despised and of no fame. But during my recent visit to Israel, I saw that the Lord chose to minister in Galilee because it was far from the religious atmosphere of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In John 3 a Pharisee and ruler of the Jews named Nicodemus came to the Lord. His speaking was full of religion. In chapter 4 the Lord went to Samaria, where He spoke with an immoral woman. Her speaking was also full of religion. Then in chapter 5 the Lord healed the impotent man. Here again, the argument came from religion: &ldquo;The Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat&rdquo; (v. 10). In chapter 6 there was no religious debate, for the Lord and His disciples were at the Sea of Galilee, far from religion. Nevertheless, after the Lord revealed that He was the bread of life to be eaten by His believers, the disciples said, &ldquo;This word is hard; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). In John 7, as the Lord was teaching in the temple, the opposition again came from religion. In chapter 8 it was again in Jerusalem that the Pharisees brought a sinful woman and questioned the Lord according to religion. Then in chapter 9 a blind man was healed, and the religionists again argued about the Sabbath. Whenever the Lord went to Jerusalem, He was always met by religious arguments.</p>
<p>When the Lord visited Jerusalem the last time, He remained in the city only during the day, and every night He left to stay in Bethany (Matt. 21:17). The Lord faced all kinds of religious arguments while He was in Jerusalem (chs. 21&mdash;22). For this reason, He chose to lodge outside of Jerusalem in Bethany.</p>
<p>Those whom the Lord called were not from Jerusalem. The first apostles were Galileans (Acts 1:11). All one hundred and twenty gathered in Jerusalem after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension were identified as Galileans (2:7). Religion was a terrible opposition to the Lord. Thus, the Lord had a new start by calling a group of young Galileans.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO DROP RELIGION TO NOT BE SEPARATED FROM CHRIST AND TO GIVE THE LORD A WAY<br />
TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Religion and Christ are two different lines. Religion is to try to worship God but without God, Christ, or the Spirit. Christ, on the other hand, is God Himself, and He is also the Spirit. He told His disciples, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9). He also told them, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality;...you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you&rdquo; (vv. 16-18). These verses indicate that Christ is the Father as well as the Spirit. First John 2:23 says, &ldquo;He who confesses the Son has the Father also.&rdquo; This also indicates that the Son and the Father are one. Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When we call Jesus, we get the Spirit. This implies the oneness of Jesus and the Spirit. As one who is God, Christ, and the Spirit, Christ is altogether different from the religious world, which lacks God, Christ, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Religion is prevalent throughout the earth today. In addition to the major religions of Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam, there are hundreds of other Christian &ldquo;isms.&rdquo; Argument among Christians concerning the form of baptism is a matter of religion, just as circumcision was in the early church. Many Christian groups have a schedule of everything that takes place during their meetings. This also is religion. When Christ was in the house in Bethany, there was no scheduled order of events. First Corinthians 14 speaks of certain principles related to functioning in the meetings, but it also speaks of functioning in the spirit. If a meeting proceeds according to fixed principles but lacks the spirit, it is like a room full of light bulbs and electrical wiring but without electricity. This is religion. To be the church is not to follow certain regulations. We need to see that the church is simply Christians in the spirit and in oneness. If we are not in the spirit and are in division, we are through.</p>
<p>If a sinner is persuaded to repent so that he will be saved from going to hell, he receives only a religious salvation. Real salvation, which is a living salvation, occurs when a sinner contacts, receives, and believes into Christ. It is not an outward, formal, religious matter but a living relationship with Christ. I am afraid that many Christians today have received only a religious salvation; they have never contacted Christ. Some may have contacted Christ at the time of their initial salvation, but they do not experience the living Christ day by day.</p>
<p>Our salvation is the living Christ. If we have Christ, we have forgiveness, the cleansing of sins, justification, and salvation. Any experience that is apart from Christ, even trying to reckon oneself dead to sin, is of religion. The way to overcome sin is not to reckon ourselves dead but to contact the living Christ. When we function in the meetings of the church, we must be careful not to do so in a religious way. Anything that we do without Christ or not in the spirit is religion.</p>
<p>Many Christians pray in a religious way. I know this because I was in such a situation. When I was studying at a Christian college, at the conclusion of a daily gathering the students would say the so-called Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. Even though we do not recite the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in the churches today, our prayer is still religious if we do not exercise our spirit, contact the Lord, and pray in the spirit. We may use our religious mind, knowledge, and vocabulary to pray religious prayers.</p>
<p>When we see that we are full of religion, we may want to do something to correct the situation. However, we do not need to do anything. We simply need to realize that Christ today is not doctrine or religion but the living Spirit. In Galatians 5:1-4 Paul tells us that if we are in the religious world, we have been separated from Christ and have fallen from grace. To be separated from Christ is to fall from grace, because grace is Christ. Grace is not a matter of religion but altogether a matter of Christ, not in a doctrinal way but in the living way of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord has no way to accomplish His purpose with religion. The earth today is filled with darkness and falsehood. The Lord must have a new start. Today the Lord needs to call some young &ldquo;Galileans.&rdquo; Even the older ones need to learn to be young. To be young means to know nothing of religion.</p>
<p>If we ask questions in our mind, even about spiritual matters such as the way to have proper meetings, we are in religion. When the Lord called the disciples, He only said, &ldquo;Come after Me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (Matt. 4:19; John 1:43). They did not ask anything but simply followed Him. Nicodemus came to the Lord at night (3:2); he did not follow Him openly, probably because of his religious concepts. The Lord did not call anyone who was older or from Jerusalem, because such ones were drugged with religious concepts. This forced the Lord to go to the uncultured, unlearned Galilean fishermen.</p>
<p>We need to drop every kind of religion&mdash;old religion, new religion, and self-made religion. Recently, I received a letter from a lady who knew the Bible well. In her letter she argued concerning the rapture. After reading her letter, I was reminded of the pitiful situation of many Christians today. Our ministry publications are not for doctrine but for life. However, because of religion, people pick up many concepts concerning certain so-called spiritual truths. In order to give the Lord a way to accomplish His purpose, we must drop all religion. We should care not for doctrine, knowledge, regulations, or forms but only for Christ, who is the living Spirit. We need only to love Him, walk by Him, live with Him and in Him, and allow Him to live in us.</p>
<p>In the beginning the believers practiced the church life in the spirit. However, the church soon fell into organization. In the New Testament the words <em>bishop</em> and <em>elder</em> are synonymous and are used interchangeably, but Ignatius, an early church father, began to teach that the bishops are higher than the elders. Now in the Catholic Church there are archbishops above the bishops, and the head is the pope. We reject such hierarchy and organization. In the centuries leading up to the Dark Ages, the church gradually lost nearly all the truth. Then Martin Luther was raised up to recover the truth of justification by faith. Eventually, the Lord raised up others to recover other items of the truth. Now at the end of time the Lord has raised us up and caused us to care for and know only Christ. We drop all religion and come together in the spirit as the church.</p>
<p>The earth is full of religious darkness, falsehood, and superstition. Some people may be saved in religious Christianity, but it is impossible for the Lord to fulfill His purpose with religion, because it is full of falsehood and mixture. Therefore, the Lord must take a new step; He must cut off the old current by gaining a group who will reject anything of dead knowledge, doctrine, or religion. To cooperate with Him in this, we need to be those who care only for the living Christ. We need to love Him, contact Him, fellowship with Him, and take Him as our life, our person, and our everything. We need to be one with Him, living by Him, with Him, and in Him. When this is our life, our living, and our testimony, we will come together as the church that the Lord desires. We need to be rescued from any kind of religious consideration. We must avoid continuing in religion or forming another religion. We need to make a decision to have nothing to do with religion. This requires a radical change in our concept, our daily life, and even our church life. My burden is that the Lord would have a new start among us by our knowing and caring for nothing apart from the living Christ as the life-giving Spirit. We must not be separated from Christ or fall from grace. Instead, we need to be attached to Christ, always enjoying Him as our grace and rejecting any religious forms, dead knowledge, or traditions.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OPPOSED BY AND<br />
MINISTERING OUTSIDE OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus came directly to the religious world. However, every time He went to Jerusalem, the center of the religious world, He encountered nothing but debating, fighting, and opposition. This forced Him to make a great change by giving up Jerusalem and going to Galilee, where He called some young fishermen and trained them for three and a half years. An apprenticeship to learn a trade normally lasts three or four years. The Lord trained His disciples not by sending them to a school but by bringing them with Him wherever He went, mainly around the Sea of Galilee. After the Lord resurrected, He appeared to the disciples and charged them to stay in Jerusalem for a number of days (Acts 1:4).</p>
<p>We may be familiar with these facts, but we need to be impressed with the real significance of this picture. First, the Lord Jesus was conceived in Nazareth, a city in Galilee. Just before the time of His birth, a census took place, which forced Mary and her husband, Joseph, to go to Bethlehem. While they were in Bethlehem, Jesus was born. Bethlehem, which is near Jerusalem, was the city of King David. Christ was conceived in the despised city of Nazareth, but He was delivered in Bethlehem, close to Jerusalem. After a short time, His parents were forced to flee to Egypt, and later they returned to Nazareth. Thus, although Christ was born in Bethlehem, He was raised in Galilee. When He was twelve years of age, He was brought to Jerusalem for a feast (Luke 2:42). According to Deuteronomy 16:16, all the males of Israel were required to go to Jerusalem three times a year for the ordained feasts. Thus, from the age of twelve or younger, the Lord probably went three times a year to Jerusalem to keep the feasts. But after the feasts, He went back to Galilee.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s ordination, a priest began his ministry when he was thirty years of age (Num. 4:3). The Lord Jesus began His ministry at that age (Luke 3:23), and John the Baptist also began his ministry at about thirty. John ministered in the wilderness of Judea, outside of Jerusalem. Because Jerusalem had fallen to become the center of a traditional religion, the Lord could not initiate the testimony of God there. When the Lord was about to begin His ministry, He first went not to Jerusalem but to John the Baptist in the wilderness (Matt. 3:13).</p>
<p>The first disciples were brought to Christ in the wilderness by the testimony of John the Baptist. When John saw Jesus coming, he said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo; (John 1:36). Some of the disciples of John heard this and followed the Lord (v. 37). One of these disciples was Andrew, who then brought his brother Simon to the Lord (vv. 40-42). At that time, the Lord immediately changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which is interpreted, Peter, meaning &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; Peter was first brought to the Lord and had his name changed not in Jerusalem or Galilee but in the wilderness. Then Peter returned to Galilee. The Lord also returned to Galilee, and while He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Peter fishing with his brother (Matt. 4:18). The Lord said, &ldquo;Come after Me,&rdquo; and Peter immediately followed (vv. 19-20). Thus, Peter was called not in Jerusalem or in the wilderness but in Galilee.</p>
<p>Galilee was a training center. The Lord trained His disciples mostly in Galilee, but when the feasts came, three times a year, the Lord and the disciples went to Jerusalem. Their time in Jerusalem was a training to the disciples because there they witnessed how the Lord handled opposition, argument, and attack from the Pharisees, scribes, chief priests, and elders.</p>
<p>After the Lord had trained His disciples for some time, He brought them to Caesarea Philippi, which is near the border of the Holy Land, at the foot of Mount Hermon (16:13). The Lord purposely brought them there, far from the religious atmosphere of Jerusalem, to give them the revelation of Christ and the church (vv. 16-18). Afterwards, the Lord brought three disciples up to Mount Hermon, where He was transfigured before them (17:1-2). When the Lord was transfigured, Moses and Elijah appeared (v. 3). Peter was excited and foolishly said, &ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah&rdquo; (v. 4). Immediately a voice from heaven stopped Peter (v. 5).</p>
<p>At that time the Lord began to tell His disciples that He had to go to Jerusalem to be crucified (16:21). Eventually, He went to Jerusalem at the time of the Feast of Passover (John 12:1, 12). This shows that the Lord is the real passover lamb. The Lord was in Jerusalem for the last six days of His life on the earth. In those days He was continually attacked and opposed. The disciples saw all of this because they were with the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord went day after day to Jerusalem to fight the battle with the Jewish religionists, but in the night He left Jerusalem to lodge in Bethany (Matt. 21:17). It was in Bethany that the Lord spoke what is recorded in John 14&mdash;17, telling His followers that He was one with the Father (14:7-11) and that He was going to become the Spirit so that He could abide in them and they in Him (vv. 16-20). He prayed that all His believers would be one in the Triune God (17:6-24). This oneness is the church, and it is the living of the vine, the organism of God&rsquo;s economy on the earth (15:1, 4-5). Through baptism we are put into the Triune God to be members of the organism of the divine economy on the earth. In John 18 the Lord went to the garden of Gethsemane, where He prepared to hand Himself over to His opposers. He was judged, sentenced to death, and crucified. Peter and the other disciples followed and saw everything.</p>
<p>After the Feast of Passover, on the first day of the week, when the firstfruits were offered to God, Christ was resurrected (20:1). That night the disciples did not go back to Galilee but stayed in Jerusalem. They had shut all the doors for fear of the Jews, but the resurrected Christ was suddenly in their midst (v. 19). We cannot comprehend how He could have entered with His physical body, but He was there. &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). At that time the Lord entered into His disciples. They returned to Galilee (21:1; cf. 6:1), but something had happened to make them different. Previously, the Lord had been among them outwardly, but now He was within them. From that point on, wherever the disciples went, the Lord was there. When they were in the house again, the Lord suddenly appeared (20:26). When they were fishing, the Lord suddenly appeared (21:3-4). They could not get away from the Lord. The Lord was always with them because He was in them. After His resurrection, He trained His disciples for forty days (Acts 1:3).</p>
<p>After these forty days, the Lord brought the disciples to the Mount of Olives and charged them to stay in Jerusalem (v. 4). Then He ascended (v. 9). While they were looking at this, two angels appeared, saying, &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven&rdquo; (v. 11).</p>
<p>These one hundred twenty Galilean men and women stayed in Jerusalem, as the Lord had charged, and prayed for ten days (vv. 14-15; 2:1). Then the Holy Spirit was poured upon them. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was the promised coming of Christ (John 14:18). Christ came back to the disciples in another form&mdash;as the Holy Spirit. Christ had entered into them already, and now He was pouring Himself upon them. They were anointed with and baptized into the Holy Spirit. In this way, they became the first expression of the church on the earth, the church in Jerusalem. Although the physical temple with the priests, scribes, and elders was still in Jerusalem, God was now dwelling in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD HAVING A NEW START<br />
WITH A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The Lord brought in a great change from the Old Testament economy to the New Testament economy. In this change He forsook the temple, the priests, the scribes, and the elders. Not even Nicodemus was among the one hundred twenty. Nicodemus was an old man and no doubt held many old opinions. Unlike Nicodemus, Peter was a blank slate, a simple fisherman. Therefore, the Lord was able to use Peter to have a new start. The Lord turned from the old generation and began something new&mdash;the church.</p>
<p>The Lord is sovereign. Among those in Jerusalem, there were a number of young people. One of them was Saul of Tarsus; he was a leader of the young religionists. He took the lead to oppose Christ and to persecute the church. He made the decision one day to wipe out all the Christians in Damascus. While he was on the way from Jerusalem, the Lord appeared to him and said, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). Saul was knocked down, he had a turn, and he was converted. Thus, this young religious leader was caught and eventually became the apostle Paul. Only the Lord could do this, gaining a young one for His new move. When I was young, I thought that it would have been better for the Lord to convert Gamaliel, the great rabbi who had taught Saul, but the Lord chose young Saul.</p>
<p>Paul was bold to drop everything of Judaism. Judaism was built upon three pillars: circumcision, the Sabbath, and dietary regulations. Paul wrote in Galatians 6:15, &ldquo;Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.&rdquo; In Romans 14:5 he said, &ldquo;One judges one day above another; another judges every day alike. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.&rdquo; He also wrote, &ldquo;I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself&rdquo; (v. 14). How bold he was! According to Galatians 2, Peter and Barnabas continually ate with the Gentile believers, which was contrary to Jewish customary practice. However, when certain Jewish believers came, Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles, and Barnabas followed (vv. 12-13). When Paul saw this, he opposed Peter to his face (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST APOSTLES COMPROMISING WITH RELIGION</h2>
<p>Although the Lord had a new start with the young Galilean fishermen and Saul of Tarsus, even these ones eventually became mixed with religion. The last time Paul was in Jerusalem, he went to James and told the elders what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry (Acts 21:18-19). The elders glorified God for this, but then they told Paul that thousands of Jews in Jerusalem had believed in the Lord and were still zealous for the law (v. 20). The elders convinced Paul that to avoid trouble with these Judaistic believers, he should take a vow of the purification at the temple with four others and pay the fee for them (vv. 23-24). This was pitiful. Even Peter and John may have been at James&rsquo;s home when this occurred. These ones whom the Lord had gained from Galilee had become people of Jerusalem; they were mixed with religion.</p>
<p>The Lord had called a group of young Galilean fishermen to be His disciples. Later, He made them apostles and appointed them as elders. Eventually, however, after they had been in Jerusalem for a period of time, perhaps ten or twenty years, they became people of Jerusalem, religious people under the influence of the old religion. They even convinced Paul to compromise with religion. It is difficult to comprehend how Paul could accept their word after having written the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians. Perhaps because Paul had a good heart and did not want to make trouble, he agreed with the elders and paid the purification fee for himself and four others at the temple. Because the Lord would not tolerate this mixture, in His sovereignty He allowed Paul to be arrested and imprisoned (vv. 33-34). People tend to compromise and bring in mixture, but the Lord would never allow this.</p>
<p>The Lord gave up the old religion, Judaism. He forsook Jerusalem and went to Galilee, where He trained a group of young people to be the leaders of His new move with the church. However, these ones eventually compromised with religion. When a person first enters a room filled with garlic, he will be shocked by the odor, but anyone who remains for some time in such a room will eventually be &ldquo;drugged&rdquo; by the odor and lose the ability to smell the garlic. After the apostles and elders who had been trained by the Lord remained in Jerusalem for a certain period of time, they were affected by the heavy atmosphere of religion and lost their ability to sense it. As a young believer, I could not understand how Paul, who had written strongly against Judaistic mixture in Romans and Galatians and had rebuked Peter for compromising with the Judaizers, could be convinced by the elders in Jerusalem to do the same. They tolerated and even compromised with the Judaistic influence to try to keep the situation calm.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD NOT TOLERATING MIXTURE</h2>
<p>My burden is that we would see that religion is in our blood. The brothers in Jerusalem and the apostle Paul tolerated it. They were trying to calm the situation, but the Lord allowed a riot to rise up against Paul, which resulted in his arrest before he completed the purification (v. 27). The Lord did not allow him to be purified in that way, for that was not a purification but a contamination. Paul&rsquo;s history was wonderful, but in this matter he was contaminated. He was weakened by the religious concept in Jerusalem, but the Lord did not tolerate it and sent him far away from Jerusalem to a prison in Rome. There Paul was truly purified and later wrote the Epistles to the Ephesians, Timothy, and Titus, Epistles of purification.</p>
<p>The church in Jerusalem became a mixture of the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy, a mixture of the law and of grace. Because the Lord could not tolerate this mixture, He sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy Jerusalem in A.D. 70. The Christians as well as the Jews suffered persecution. This was another purification. Nevertheless, after the Lord purified the church through persecution, the church went back to mixture with religion. The religious element is still mixed with the church today.</p>
<p>We need to see the Lord&rsquo;s way. The church in Jerusalem was built in a new way&mdash;with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and with the Triune God&mdash;but it eventually became a mixture with religion, with the law and Judaism. Throughout church history, mixture has come in again and again. In the 1500s Martin Luther was used by the Lord to recover the truth of justification by faith, but Luther did not help the condition of the church. Rather, it was through him that the state churches came into existence. Afterward, the private churches were formed. The recovery of the proper church life did not begin until the 1700s with Zinzendorf and the Moravian brethren in Germany. A further recovery of the church life occurred a hundred years later, in the late 1820s, when the Lord raised up the British Brethren. This was a further step in the recovery of the church practice, but it was eventually damaged through division caused by doctrinal concepts. Then the Lord was forced to go to China. The first meeting of a local church in China took place in Foochow in 1922. Throughout the years the Lord has shown us more of the proper way to practice the church life. Because this present step of recovery stands on the shoulders of the previous steps, the light is clearer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH TODAY FACING<br />
RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION AND MIXTURE</h2>
<p>We must be watchful that mixture would not come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In 1962 I was commissioned by the Lord to sound the trumpet of His recovery in the United States. At that time I was advised by some co-workers not to teach concerning the local church, but I was burdened by the Lord to teach this truth. Now many years later, <em>local church</em> has become a popular term in the Christian market, appearing in radio broadcasts and printed materials. Various groups even claim to be local churches. First, some opposed our teaching concerning the practice of the church life; then others received it and mixed it with denominational practices. Even some among us have begun to compromise with religious mixture. If Peter and the other apostles could compromise, it is possible that we too could err in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD NEEDING TO HAVE A FRESH START TODAY</h2>
<p>I am sorrowful to see the situation today of mixture, compromise, and toleration. However, the Lord will never change; rather, He will leave the old generation and have a fresh start with a group of young people, just as He did in Galilee. The Lord was not able to use the Pharisees, Sadducees, or even good ones like Nicodemus. The Lord left them in Jerusalem and spent three and a half years to train some young fishermen. Today the Lord will train a group of young people and send them out. The most crucial areas of the earth today are Europe and the United States. I believe that the United States is today&rsquo;s Galilee, and Europe is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem. The Lord will use the United States to train a group of young people and then send them to Europe, especially to the college campuses. The Lord will gain the United States and Europe by capturing and training a group of young people.</p>
<p>We must say no to mixture, compromise, and toleration. The United States and Europe are full of superstition, tradition, and organized religion. We need to see that the Lord has no way with today&rsquo;s religion, just as He had no way with Judaism, the old religion. The Lord dropped Judaism, and He will also drop today&rsquo;s religion.</p>
<p>I hope that many saints from the United States will migrate to Europe and Israel. Those who stay in the United States need to carry out three main functions: gain students on the college campuses, pray for those who migrate, and supply the sent ones materially. Those who migrate may go as students, enrolling in a master&rsquo;s program to study the language of the country they are in. If some young ones have a burden for Europe, they may study French or German as an undergraduate in the United States and then enroll in a master&rsquo;s program in France or Germany. While they are studying, they can contact their fellow students. They should not care for gaining a large number. In the years that it takes to earn a master&rsquo;s degree, they may gain several of their classmates. That group will become a nucleus for the Lord to raise up a church in that place. In this way the Lord can raise up churches in every country in Europe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE WAYS TO BE PREPARED<br />
TO BE SENT OUT BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>Today the young people need to prepare themselves in three ways to go either to Europe or to a college campus in the United States. First, they need to learn languages. I encourage all the young people to learn foreign languages. At the present time European languages are the most useful. The young ones need to learn the languages thoroughly, learning the grammar, pronunciation, and composition until they are able to speak fluently, translate, and compose. When they migrate to a country, they should already be able to express themselves clearly. The young people also need to learn human history in order to understand the national disposition and character of the people whom they contact. I encourage the young people to go to Europe, not to work but to enroll in school to master the language. While studying, they can contact local young people. After three years, they will have mastered the language and gained a number of young companions to form a nucleus of believers to gain the country.</p>
<p>Second, the young people need to gain the experiences in the church life to learn how to care for others. In this way they will be prepared to take the lead and be responsible ones in the churches that are raised up where they go.</p>
<p>Third, the young people need to learn all the truths&mdash;the truths concerning such matters as the gospel, the church, the kingdom, life, and grace. They need to read and study all the books that we publish in order to be fully instructed. Then, when they go out, they can teach the truth to others. The young people need to be prepared in these three ways&mdash;learning languages, gaining the church life experience, and learning the truth.</p>
<p>In this way the Lord will be able to prepare His bride. Soon every European country and every major campus in the United States will have a nucleus as a small army fighting the battle and raising up new churches. We all need to pray and stand with those who go out. Otherwise, it will be difficult to overcome the religious mixture. We must have a new start. The Lord needs a new current to flow Himself out. We must give the Lord a way to have this new current.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
REVEALED IN GALATIANS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RELIGION OPPOSING CHRIST,<br />
PERSECUTING THE CHURCH, AND<br />
BRINGING MIXTURE INTO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Although the Lord came directly to the religious world, He did not have rest when He was in Jerusalem, where the temple of God was. Whenever He went to Jerusalem, religious ones tried to debate with Him. The Lord rested mainly in Galilee and sometimes outside Jerusalem in Bethany. In the last week of His life, during the day He went into Jerusalem, and at night He lodged in Bethany. Christ had no rest in Jerusalem because Judaism had fallen to become a religion in which people who were apparently worshipping God were actually persecuting God by attacking Christ.</p>
<p>Galatians 1:14 and Acts 22:3 show that the apostle Paul was born, raised, and fully educated in Judaism. He was absolutely for that religion. When Stephen was martyred, Paul was there (7:58). Paul was converted when he was on the way to persecute and ravage the church (Gal. 1:13). Because no one else could deal with Paul, the Lord appeared to him directly (v. 12). Paul was perhaps the only person who heard the gospel directly from the Lord after His ascension. Paul was so strong in his inherited religion that no one other than the Lord could change his mind. The Lord met Paul on the road to Damascus and knocked him down to rescue him from religion. Paul knew religion, but he did not know God. He was in religion, but he was not in Christ. When Christ met him, Paul experienced a radical turn.</p>
<p>Because the situation in Jerusalem was not good for God&rsquo;s purpose, the Lord went to Galilee to raise up some fishermen to be the first apostles and elders. Peter took the lead among them. When Peter was already an apostle and an elder, Saul of Tarsus was still persecuting the church. Eventually, the Lord appeared to Saul, knocked him down, and turned him from religion to Christ, causing him to have a radical turn. Peter also turned but in the opposite direction. Galatians 2 tells us that some time after Paul was converted, the apostle Peter became weak, timid, and afraid of religion. Peter was eating with the Gentile believers, but when some Jewish believers came, Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles (v. 12). Because of this, Paul opposed Peter to his face (v. 11). Although Peter was originally a Galilean, one outside the realm of religion, he eventually compromised with religion. However, Paul, who was raised up in religion, took sides with Christ, a Galilean, and rebuked Peter.</p>
<p>In every age religion is strong. The concept of many Christians is that Christ died to rescue us out of hell and into heaven. However, in Galatians Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age&rdquo; (1:4). We have seen in the preceding chapters that the present evil age is a section of the religious world. The religious age of the apostle Paul was evil, and our age, our section of the religious world, is perhaps even more evil. During a recent visit to Europe and the Middle East, I was deeply impressed by the evil of religion. I was fully disappointed with the mixture in religion and assured that the Lord has no way except through His recovery. For this reason, the young brothers and sisters need to prepare themselves to be sent to the leading cities in Europe to sound the trumpet of the truth and expose false religion, tradition, and superstition.</p>
<p>The archbishop of the Church of England recently met with the pope to discuss the reunification of the Church of England with the Catholic Church. The Church of England is the eldest &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; of the Catholic Church; the second &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; is the Lutheran Church. Other &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; are the Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church. The so-called ecumenical movement is for the goal of reuniting these &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; with the &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; Moreover, Catholicism has now accepted the charismatic movement and has brought leaven into this movement by mixing in the worship of Mary. What a devilish mixture! When I was in Rome, I heard the pope give a spiritual sermon. However, he rode in a palanquin built with bronze taken from a pagan temple, and he spoke in a room with a painting that ranked Mary with the Trinity and had countless depictions of serpents on the walls. In Matthew 13:33 the Catholic Church is signified by the woman who hid leaven in the meal.</p>
<p>I believe that at the end time, before Antichrist comes, the Lord will shame His enemy by establishing a strong testimony in Europe. I am burdened that we would go to every country in Europe. I now see that the Lord sent His recovery to the United States to gain a number of young people to send to Europe. The greatest need for our labor in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is in Europe. We need to send a good number of young brothers and sisters there. The United States is today&rsquo;s Galilee, and the Lord is now calling many Galilean fishermen.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no hope with religion. In Neuch&#226;tel, Switzerland, I saw a cathedral, which the reformer William Farel helped to clear of many Catholic images in the 1500s. However, now there is a large image of Farel outside the cathedral. Tradition follows tradition, superstition follows superstition, and religion follows religion. At the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem I saw many Jews superstitiously kissing the wall while praying. Every religion is full of superstition and lacks truth, light, and life. There is no Christ in religion. The Lord&rsquo;s second coming cannot be brought about by religion. The burden is upon us. I believe that one day through His recovery the Lord will gain a living testimony in every major city.</p><h2 class="head1">GALATIANS USING THE BACKGROUND OF RELIGION<br />
TO REVEAL CHRIST</h2>
<p>Galatians exposes religion more than any other book in the New Testament. However, Paul&rsquo;s intention in writing Galatians was not merely to expose Judaism as the present section of the evil religious world but rather to use the background of religion to reveal Christ. Religion comes in when there is a shortage of Christ. Religion becomes prevailing when there is no Christ. If we are fighting against religion, yet we do not have Christ, even our fighting will eventually become a kind of religion. Anything we do for God apart from Christ becomes religion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Revealed in Us and Living in Us</h2>
<p>In Galatians Paul impresses us with Christ. Paul writes, &ldquo;I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother&rsquo;s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me&rdquo; (1:14-16). In Acts 9:3 Luke tells us that Paul outwardly saw the light on the road to Damascus, but in Galatians 1:16 Paul refers not to an outward light but to an inward revelation.</p>
<p>Because Christ was revealed into Paul, he could say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (2:20). First, Christ is revealed into us; then, Christ lives in us. This is not religion but the living Christ, who is versus religion.</p>
<p>The religious mentality cannot comprehend spiritual matters. A certain Christian leader teaches that Christ cannot be in us because He resurrected with a physical body and ascended to the third heaven. This leader teaches that Christ is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit. This is a new religion produced by the religious mentality and tradition. Traditional teachings concerning the Trinity, the historical Christ, and the unapproachable and infinite greatness of God convinced this leader that man cannot contain Christ.</p>
<p>We should not exercise our mind to try to understand how Christ can be in us. We need to drop the religious mentality and take the pure Word of God. Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; In John 15:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; The New Testament reveals that Christ lives in us. We simply need to say, &ldquo;Amen. Christ is in me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Baptized into Christ and Putting On Christ</h2>
<p>In Galatians 3:27 Paul says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Christ not only lives within us, but He is also a realm, a sphere, into which we have entered through baptism. In other words, Christ lives in us, and we live in Him. We should sense that we are living in Christ every day. Christ is the sphere, the realm, and the environment in which we live and walk. If our outward environment begins to bother us, we need to be reminded by the Spirit that in reality we are living in Christ. He lives in us, and we live in Him. Furthermore, we need to put on Christ, as we would put on a garment. Christ is in us and upon us. Inwardly, He is our life; outwardly, He is our clothing, our covering.</p>
<p>Christ living in us and our living in Christ and putting on Christ should not be doctrine to us but our daily experience. We do not care for religion, forms, teachings, or doctrines but only for the living Christ. As a result of Christ living in us, our living in Christ, and our putting on Christ, we live Christ and magnify Christ (Phil. 1:20-21). We are the expression of Christ. Every member of the new man is Christ (Col. 3:10-11). This corporate Christ is the church (1 Cor. 12:12).</p>
<p>We should not be quick in answering others&rsquo; questions about the church. We need to learn to speak to others in a proper way so that we do not give them ground for misunderstanding. Someone may ask if our meetings are quiet or noisy. If I were asked this, I would say, &ldquo;Friend, your question is a question of religion. We do not have religion&mdash;we have the living Christ. We are not a noisy church, nor are we a quiet church. We are a church that seeks to be filled with Christ.&rdquo; Because the human mind today is filled with religious concepts, there are endless questions about our practice of the church life. Such religious questions are related to matters such as head covering, pray-reading, physical appearance, and the eldership. In my years of ministering for the Lord, no one ever asked me if the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery seek to be filled with Christ. We must be careful in how we answer religious questions. Anything that we do for God apart from Christ is religion. We are religion-conscious, but God wants us to be Christ-conscious.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Formed in Us and<br />
Our Not Being Separated from Christ</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, &ldquo;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&rdquo; Christ is formed in us. In 5:4 Paul says, &ldquo;You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.&rdquo; If we return to religion, we are separated from Christ. Christ will never go along with religion. Christ is always versus religion, and religion is always against Christ. If we care for religion, we are through with Christ. If we care for Christ, we will have nothing to do with religion. However, we all have preoccupying religious concepts. Any Christian in a new kind of meeting will criticize the meeting according to his or her religious concepts. We should measure a meeting only according to how much Christ is expressed. We need a vision to see that God does not want any religion. God wants only Christ.</p>
<p>The Gospels show that while the Lord was on the earth, He did not keep any forms. He ministered in every place&mdash;the mountaintop, the seashore, homes, and streets. We need such a Christ today. Christ is more real and practical to us than He was to His disciples, for He is within us, but He could only be among them. We should not add religious forms or concepts to Christ. To decide to function in a meeting without being led by the Lord is to bring in a form. To avoid bringing in religion, we should simply come to the meeting full of Christ. We need to tell the Lord every day, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. The disciples followed You outwardly, but today I follow You inwardly. Lord, I will never leave You. I want to be with You always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been a Christian for many years. At the very beginning of my Christian life I picked up many religious concepts. I thought that since I was a Christian, I needed to always be gentle and submissive and never lose my temper. Such concepts are religious. I read many books to try to learn how to overcome sin and be kind, gentle, humble, and pleasant. However, I eventually realized that these books were religious. Now I see that I do not need to strive to overcome sin or to be kind, gentle, humble, and pleasant. My only responsibility is to love Christ, follow Him, and remain in His presence. We should not be conscious of anything but Christ. We should always be Christ-conscious.</p>
<p>We should not consider whether or not the elders in our church are good. This kind of question comes from a religious mind. If we are Christ-conscious, we will not have such a question. We should care only for Christ. Being Christ-conscious takes care of everything else. All the saints in a local church should be Christ-conscious.</p>
<p>Many saints today are still more religion-conscious than Christ-conscious. When someone speaks in the meetings, others may have opinions about the speaking. This is religion. Recently, I was asked how a brother should deal with someone who is bothering him. This question is in the realm of religion. Because Christ lives within us, we do not need to ask this kind of question. If we are Christ-conscious, we will not be bothered by something in our environment such as a troublesome roommate. Saints have expressed opinions to me about certain brothers or sisters being good or bad. This kind of thinking is also in the realm of religion. The Lord does not categorize persons or situations according to good and bad. If we are Christ-conscious, we will see that all the saints are lovable. To someone who is Christ-conscious, every person and situation is about the same.</p>
<p>Questions from a religious mind are endless. A sister may ask what style of glasses she should wear. This is religion. Instead of being conscious of glasses, we need to be Christ-conscious and care only for Christ. A brother may ask what kind of diet he should have. This question too is of religion. Everything is religion when Christ is neglected. Apparently, my wife controls my eating, but actually, it is Christ. It is only because I have Christ within me that I am able to accept my wife&rsquo;s control of my diet. Even asking how to live by Christ is in the realm of religion. Living by Christ is like breathing. We do not first study it and then try to apply it; instead, we learn by doing.</p>
<p>Anything that we do to please God apart from Christ is religion. Christ is real and practical. He should not be limited to the realm of doctrine. The answer to every question is the indwelling Christ. Questions concerning relationships, dress, and diet are all answered by Christ within. If we are Christ-conscious, Christ will be everything to us.</p>
<p>Christianity today has become a religion of doing things for God apart from Christ. Many Christians serve and worship God but neglect Christ. We should decide on a hairstyle not according to current fashions but according to Christ&rsquo;s speaking within. We need to see the principle of living by the indwelling Christ. If I am about to become impatient with someone, Christ within me will trouble me about this, and I simply need to say, &ldquo;Amen, Lord.&rdquo; In this way I gain the victory. The Christian life is not a matter of teaching, form, regulation, or instruction. We simply need to follow Christ within.</p>
<p>We need a vision and a revelation to see that God desires nothing but Christ and that Christ today is living, real, and practical. Galatians 6:15 says, &ldquo;Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.&rdquo; The new creation is the mingling of Christ with us. Christ lives within us, we are one with Christ, and we are living Christ. While we are living Christ, we are Christ, because He is expressed through us. When we see this vision, the entire Bible will become light, life, and food to us. In today&rsquo;s recovery God wants a group of people who are Christ-conscious&mdash;living by Christ, walking with Christ, loving Christ, dealing with Christ, and remaining in Christ&rsquo;s presence all the time.</p>
<p>I believe that the Lord will prepare a good number of saints to send out to Europe and Israel to raise up churches. He will come back when He can tell the enemy, &ldquo;You have set up many religious things, but look at My church, My bride. They all live by Me and are one with Me. They are no longer religious, and they have no tradition, superstition, or falsehood. They have only Christ. They are a group of people who are fully Christ-conscious, and they are My testimony.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH AND<br />
THE PRESENT NEED IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>As the Lord is going on, we need to be clear about the nature, position, and function of the church as well as the history of the church. Then we will know where we are. The revelation in the New Testament concerning the church is clear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING PRODUCED<br />
BY CHRIST BECOMING LIFE TO HIS BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The church is produced by Christ becoming life to us. Christ came as God incarnate, lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and died on the cross to take care of all the problems and to release the divine life, producing the church. He died as the Lamb of God to take away our sins, accomplishing a full redemption for us, and also as a grain of wheat, releasing the divine life within Him to produce many grains in resurrection (John 1:29; 12:24). As the grain of wheat, Christ died and resurrected to release the divine life into all His believers, making them, as many grains, the same as He is. He was once the only grain, but through His death and resurrection He was multiplied to become many grains. These many grains constitute the church. The church is a constitution of Christ, the produce of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s multiplication.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ORGANIZATION AND HIERARCHY<br />
CREEPING INTO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the believers were baptized into the Spirit (Acts 2:4). The Triune God was within them, and they were in the Triune God. At that time they became the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, to be a corporate expression of God in Christ on earth (Eph. 1:22-23). However, this glorious situation did not last long. The New Testament shows that near the end of the first century, while some of the apostles were still on the earth, religion had subtly crept into the church. For instance, Revelation 2:15 says that some held the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The word <em>Nicolaitans</em> is composed of two Greek words meaning &ldquo;to conquer&rdquo; and &ldquo;the common people,&rdquo; indicating that hierarchy had come in.</p>
<p>Church history confirms that at the end of the first century a system of hierarchy began to creep into the church. In the New Testament the terms <em>elder</em> and <em>bishop</em> are synonyms and are used interchangeably. In Acts 20:17 Paul called for the elders; then in verse 28 he addressed them as overseers, or bishops. This proves that the elders are the bishops. <em>Elder</em> mainly denotes the person, and <em>bishop,</em> or <em>overseer,</em> denotes the function of an elder. These two terms refer to the same person. In the New Testament there is no rank among the elders and overseers. However, at the end of the first century, Ignatius began to teach that the elders oversee one church and that the bishops oversee several churches, thus ranking the bishops above the elders.</p>
<p>Initially, the church had no organization but was purely an organic constitution of regenerated believers to be the Body of Christ for His expression. Then organization began to come in through hierarchy, which eventually expanded to include many levels. Hierarchy and organization kill the function of the members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The hierarchy in the Catholic Church was fully established by A.D. 600. The hierarchy did not develop much in the first two centuries because the church was under the persecution of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, the ranking of bishops above elders was the start. By A.D. 313 Constantine the Great accepted Christianity, and it eventually became the state religion. Thus, not only was the church free from persecution, but also thousands of unbelieving, unconverted, unrepentant Romans were brought into Christendom as prophesied by the parable of the tares in Matthew 13:24-30.</p>
<p>Originally, the church did not need organization because every member was living. Every member in our physical body is living and therefore functions as it should without needing to be told what to do. We do not need to give an order to our nose for it to smell something. Because we are living organisms and every member is living, every part of our body functions spontaneously. Only something lifeless, like a machine, needs organization. The unification of Christianity with the Roman Empire brought many dead ones into Christianity, creating the need for organization. Due to the papacy and the hierarchical organization of the Catholic Church, the earth became increasingly dark. The Dark Ages lasted from the sixth to the eleventh century. Corrupted, darkened, evil organization prevailed until the Reformation began.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REFORMATION<br />
RECOVERING SOME TRUTHS<br />
BUT RESULTING IN MANY DIVISIONS</h2>
<p>The Reformation began around 1517. Martin Luther had no intention to rebel against the Catholic Church. His writings show that his intention was only that the doctrine of justification by faith would be made clear to the people. However, after Luther many reformers began to leave the Catholic Church. Luther made a mistake when he supported the establishment of state churches in Germany. This mistake resulted in the formation of many state churches in Germany and abroad. The state churches separated from the Catholic Church, yet they kept many organizational aspects of the apostate church, especially the hierarchy of the clergy. This organization kills the function of the members. Today in the Catholic Church and in the state churches, the members do not all function. Hired clergy carry out spiritual functions for the lay people.</p>
<p>After the state churches were formed, seeking saints began to see certain aspects of the truth through their reading of the Bible. For instance, some saw that baptism should be by immersion rather than by sprinkling, the Catholic practice. Those who saw baptism by immersion in the Scriptures stood up for this truth and even suffered persecution for it. This is the source of the Baptist Church, which is a private church. Other examples of private churches are the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church. These also failed to cut off all aspects of organization. The state churches and the private churches inherited organization from their &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>From the second century the church fathers began to argue, debate, and fight over their different concepts concerning the Trinity and the person of Christ. The church was divided by these doctrinal disputations. Then Constantine the Great came to power. Because he did not want to see religious fighting in his empire, he summoned all the great teachers to a council in Nicaea in A.D. 325. That council produced the first creed, which is recognized today by the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches. However, the first Nicene Creed was not complete, and a later council amended the creed by adding that the Holy Spirit is &ldquo;the Lord and Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified.&rdquo; However, this creed still did not stop the disputation and division. Thus, from the beginning, the church has been damaged by organization, which kills the function of the members of the Body, and division, which is brought in by doctrinal disputation. Since the sixteenth century, division after division has come in among the private churches. After the Second World War, especially in the United States, the independent groups began. Today there are thousands of divisions among Christians.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose is to have a proper church&mdash;full of life and constituted with Christ&mdash;to be the expression of God on the earth. Today the church has been fully deadened by organization and divided into many different groups. Most Christian groups hold the basic items of the faith concerning the Bible, the Person of Christ, and salvation, but the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose has become impossible. Organization and division prevent the church from being a living organism&mdash;the Body of Christ as the fullness of the One who fills all in all&mdash;to express God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEAVENING OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The degradation of the church through the centuries has been a result not only of organization and division but also of mixture with heathenism and paganism. After Constantine the Great accepted Christianity, many pagan things were brought into the church and given a Christian name, including Christmas, Easter, and the worship of Mary. G. H. Pember clearly defined the pagan things brought in by Catholicism in his book <em>Mystery Babylon the Great.</em> In Matthew 13:33 the Lord likens this mixture to leaven, &ldquo;which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; This woman is the apostate Roman Catholic Church, called Jezebel in Revelation 2:20. Today nearly every truth has been leavened. The leaven of Christmas has been added to the truth of the incarnation. Easter has been added to the resurrection. The purity of the truth has been lost in degraded Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STAGES OF RECOVERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Luther, Zinzendorf, and the Moravian Brethren</h2>
<p>The recovery of the truth began when Martin Luther recovered the truth of justification by faith. Two centuries after Luther, seeking Christians in northern Europe were under persecution and forced to leave their countries. Many went to Germany, where a brother named Zinzendorf, who genuinely loved the Lord, allowed them to settle on his large estate. These persecuted ones came to Zinzendorf&rsquo;s estate with many differing opinions, and their dissension and fighting increased after their arrival. One day in 1727 Zinzendorf called them together and convinced them to drop their disputations and to hold only to the items of the common faith. That Lord&rsquo;s Day, at the Lord&rsquo;s table, they experienced an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and there was a great revival. This began the first practice of the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but the light that these Moravian Brethren saw was not very clear.</p><h2 class="head2">The British Brethren</h2>
<p>One hundred years later, in 1827, the Lord raised up the British or Plymouth Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby. They took a stand to practice the church life. The light became clearer in this second practice of the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They were quite strong in spirit and rich in life, but when they began to study the Scriptures, they became ensnared and paid too much attention to doctrines. They developed different understandings concerning doctrines, and by 1918, ninety years after their beginning, they were divided into approximately one hundred fifty groups. The two main divisions are the Exclusive Brethren and the Open Brethren. Among these, there are many other small divisions. Some years ago, a young sister told me that she was raised in a Brethren assembly that was divided because some insisted on using an organ and others insisted on using a piano. The Brethren became dead and then divided by paying too much attention to doctrines. Eventually, they became the fulfillment of the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3. Thus, the Brethren practice of the church life was spoiled by the end of the 1800s after spreading quite prevailingly from Europe to South America, North America, Africa, and Australasia.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Brother Watchman Nee and<br />
the Beginning of the Church Life in China</h2>
<p>The first practice of the church life began with Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren in 1727. Then the British Brethren were raised up in 1827 with a more complete vision but were damaged by emphasizing doctrinal knowledge. One hundred years later, the third practice of the church life began in China. Brother Watchman Nee explained to me that the Lord was forced to go to the virgin soil of China because the long history of traditional Christianity in Europe and America had spoiled those places for the proper practice of the church life. Because China was pagan and heathen, it was unspoiled, virgin soil for the practice of the church life. Brother Nee was saved in 1920, and two years later he saw the light concerning the problem of denominations and the proper practice of the church life. He started a meeting at a sister&rsquo;s home in his hometown of Foochow, and that was the beginning of the church life in China. Before that time all Christian meetings in China were led by Western missionaries and were held in church buildings that were built by missionaries. At nineteen years of age, Watchman Nee was the first native Chinese to start a meeting in a believer&rsquo;s home without a pastor or anything of denominational Christianity. This group simply met in the name of the Lord Jesus and according to the Bible.</p>
<p>Among this group there were seven or eight young people who were co-workers, including Brother Nee. One was especially gifted in preaching the gospel. He was becoming popular as a traveling evangelist, when a brother from the Christian and Missionary Alliance proposed to him that he should be formally ordained so that various denominations would open their doors to him. The others meeting with Brother Nee agreed with the ordination of this brother. They had cut off the old current, but religion came in through a gifted one who was seeking popularity. When Brother Nee refused to agree with this brother&rsquo;s ordination, the other members signed a paper to excommunicate Brother Nee. Thus, religion crept in to spoil the first attempt to practice the church life in China.</p>
<p>In those times Brother Nee was learning the lesson of the cross&mdash;not to fight for himself and not even to vindicate himself. He moved away to a suburb of Foochow, and from 1925 to 1927 he used his time to publish twenty-four issues of a magazine called <em>The Christian</em> in which he expounded the first three chapters of Revelation. He was only a little over twenty years of age. That magazine grew to a monthly distribution of ten thousand, and I became familiar with Brother Nee by subscribing to it. I began to write to Brother Nee in 1925, and he answered me. Through this correspondence we came to know each other. In those twenty-four issues, he thoroughly exposed denominational Christianity, explaining the meaning of the works and teaching of the Nicolaitans (2:6, 15). Throughout China hundreds of young people were enlightened and raised up to follow the Lord through reading <em>The Christian.</em></p>
<p>I began to become clear about the denominations in 1925, when I was nineteen. I remained in my denomination and testified to the other members for about two years. Because they respected me as a seeking young believer, they asked me to give messages on Lord&rsquo;s Day mornings. In 1927 they elected me as a member of the board, but I told them that I could not accept the position and asked them to remove my name from their &ldquo;book of life.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Spread and Development of<br />
the Church Life in China</h2>
<p>In 1926 Brother Nee received a burden to move to Shanghai, and the church life there began by 1927. About five years later, in 1932, the Lord touched me, and a church was raised up in my hometown of Chefoo. That was the first church in north China. From 1932 to 1934 small groups were raised up in many places through Brother Nee&rsquo;s publications.</p>
<p>A large number of believers left the denominations, but few were clear about the proper practice of the church life. Many of the groups that were raised up met in a way that was still influenced by the denominational background. Religious concepts were brought into the new start. In 1933 I dropped my job and went to Shanghai to meet with Brother Nee, and he asked me to stay there. At that time the sisters were not allowed to pray or testify in the meetings. That was something of religion that had crept in from the Brethren background. Brother Nee and some of the other leading ones felt that this restriction was not good or profitable and caused the church to be like a half-paralyzed body. Therefore, Brother Nee fellowshipped with the brothers concerning the need to release the sisters to function. However, he could not get through, because most of the other leading ones would not agree. When I came to Shanghai, Brother Nee said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we have to pray for a problem that we have here. In our meetings the sisters are silent. This is a loss.&rdquo; We prayed steadfastly, and eventually the dissenting ones reluctantly agreed to release the sisters. In 1934 the sisters began to pray in the meetings, but they were not allowed to give testimonies. There was still some religion there. Gradually, many began to feel that there was a loss, because many sisters have good testimonies. After much consideration, we made a decision that based upon 1 Timothy 2:12, the sisters should not teach, but they could give personal testimonies. We took this stand to give the sisters the liberty to testify. This history shows that religion is in our blood. It is not easy to be completely rid of religion. Apparently, we had cut off the old current, but religion still crept in.</p>
<p>It is not easy to be free from all religious concepts. Many traditions and concepts have been brought into the church over the past nineteen hundred years. Today even unbelievers have concepts concerning Christianity. When a man is saved and comes into the church, he already has certain concepts about how things should be done. However, the young people do not have many opinions. It is for this reason that the Lord began His ministry with a group of young Galileans. Nearly two thousand years later in China, the Lord again came to a fresh group of young people. Because the young people are fresh, they are good for the Lord&rsquo;s new move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Development of Brother Nee&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>Year after year Brother Nee saw more light and helped us to see the light as well. In the early years under the leadership of Brother Nee, we studied the Bible, church history, all the major spiritual writings, and many biographies of spiritual giants from the early church fathers down to the present century. By around 1928 Brother Nee had collected over three thousand classical Christian writings. In 1924 and 1925 his bedroom was full of books. His bed had two rows of books on it, leaving only a narrow strip for him to lie down&mdash;he was buried in books. By his help, we built up a habit to collect and read valuable spiritual books. Therefore, although we did not come to the Western world, we contacted Western Christianity by reading the histories, biographies, and all the main writings. We decided that if any practice or teaching was not according to the Bible, we would not take it. At that time we were not clear that the main thing is not to be scriptural but to be in the spirit. Gradually, the Lord adjusted us from stressing doctrines to stressing the spirit. Before Brother Nee&rsquo;s arrest and imprisonment he had begun to emphasize that we must be in the spirit.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry, there were at least three or four times when he saw a further revelation concerning the church. Looking back, we can see that the revelation was completed just before he was imprisoned. Because I was with him for many years, I not only read his writings, but I also had many talks with him. I knew what was within him. The central, crucial point of Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry was twofold&mdash;Christ as life and everything to us to produce the church, and the church as the Body, the fullness, of Christ to be expressed in many localities. Once Brother Nee said that he had a dream in which he saw a local church in every city in China. This vision was his burden and his ministry. In my life I have met all kinds of Christians, but I never met a person who knew life, the Lord, and the Bible as deeply as Brother Nee.</p><h2 class="head2">The Spread of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery to the West</h2>
<p>Because he knew life, the Lord, and the Bible, Brother Nee was clear about the Lord&rsquo;s move, and he realized that some day the recovery would spread to the Western world. However, because he did not expect it to go to the West soon, he never encouraged the co-workers to go out of China. Also, the situation in China did not encourage us to go abroad because the work in China was full of God&rsquo;s blessing, and there was much work to do. With one language we were able to serve six hundred million people. From Shanghai, where the largest church was, we supplied five or six hundred local churches throughout China. Therefore, we were fully occupied. We did not have time to consider going abroad. Then, under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty, there was a political change in China. In 1949 all of mainland China was suddenly taken over by the Communists, who would not allow any teachings or groups to exist but communism and the Communist Party. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s move was forced from mainland China to Taiwan, and from Taiwan it eventually spread to the United States.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENEMY&rsquo;S STRATEGY<br />
AGAINST THE TRUTH IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The crucial point of Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry was to minister Christ as life to produce the church, which is the Body and the fullness of Christ expressed in many localities. The subtle strategy of the enemy is to cause Christianity to receive Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry concerning life but to reject his ministry concerning the church. The enemy&rsquo;s subtle work is of three aspects. First, one source has spread a rumor that after the Second World War Brother Nee changed his view concerning the ground of the church and the practicality of the church life. According to this rumor, there is a difference between Watchman Nee&rsquo;s teaching concerning the church and my teaching. <em>Further Talks on the Church Life</em> was published in 1969 to refute this rumor. This book lists the date, location, and original publication information for each message to prove that Brother Nee never changed his view concerning the ground of the church and the practicality of the church life. This book shows that, if anything, he became stronger.</p>
<p>After <em>Further Talks on the Church Life</em> was published, the source of the rumor changed its approach. In a book entitled <em>Against the Tide,</em> instead of saying that Brother Nee changed, the author says that Brother Nee was wrong in the matter of the church. Those who believe this accept Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry related to life but condemn his ministry related to the church. This is the subtle doing of the enemy to dilute this ministry. It is like cutting off the head but keeping the body. The Lord raised up the ministry of Brother Nee for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The main point of his ministry is to recover the church life with Christ as life.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the enemy&rsquo;s subtle activity is an attitude of compromise among some co-workers. Regrettably, not many of Brother Nee&rsquo;s co-workers were clear and strong concerning the ground of the church and the practicality of the church life. Some were clear but were not capable or strong to present these things to the saints. Others were clear and capable but maintained a compromising attitude, fearing that they might offend others. They knew the truth and were clear about the ground of the church and the practicality of the church life, but they exercised their mind rather than their spirit to be clever and compromising to avoid offending others. Because Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry has been diluted in this way, today it needs to be strengthened and intensified.</p>
<p>The third aspect of the enemy&rsquo;s strategy is to bring in mixture and confusion through religion. After we had already published many books concerning the church, I was sent by the Lord to the United States, but some co-workers who were afraid of offending others advised me not to use the term <em>the local church.</em> Nevertheless, I sounded the trumpet concerning the ground of locality. However, today the term <em>the local church</em> has become popular in Christianity. Some Pentecostal Christians have adopted the writings of Brother Nee and invented new ways to define <em>the local church.</em> Among Christians in the United States there are at least three or four different ways in which the term <em>the local church</em> is used.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S NEED IN HIS RECOVERY TODAY</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord promised and prophesied, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; Today religion has permeated every part of the earth. The enemy has utilized the Bible to form many different religions. The Lord has no way to use any of these religions to accomplish His purpose. Although some have been saved in religion, and some have even been helped to improve their daily walk, there is no possibility for the prophecy in Matthew 16:18 to be fulfilled in religion. However, the Lord will not give up. We know that He will build His church because in Revelation 19:7 His wife is ready.</p>
<p>The pure bride will not be the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, the independent groups, or the charismatic movement. It must be something else, something apart from religion. Thus, there is a need for the Lord to raise up a group to have a new start. He will take the same way that He took when He began His ministry in Galilee&mdash;He will gain a group of young people.</p>
<p>We must not become old or out of date in our concepts. A religious mind may disapprove of our way of releasing our spirit in the meetings. However, it is better for a meeting to be living and loud than for it to be dead and silent. Our way of meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is not a matter of formality but of exercising our spirit. The Lord is not only in the heavens but also in our spirit. The Lord said in John 15:4, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Philippians 1:21 says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; These words need to be real to us. We should express Christ in the meetings. When we eat, table manners are not as important as taking the food into us. Eating with good manners is good, but manners may prevent us from enjoying the food. The most enjoyable meal is eaten at home without formal table manners. When we come to the church meetings, we come home for a meal. We should care more for eating and enjoyment than for strict order.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, one day the Lord will use Antichrist and the kings under him to terminate religion. Daniel 8, 9, and 11 reveal that at the end of this age Antichrist will be raised up, and he will sign a covenant with the nation of Israel for seven years. After three and a half years, the great tribulation will begin when Antichrist breaks his covenant with the Jews and begins to persecute them. He will cause the offerings to stop and will set himself up as God, putting an image of himself in the temple to be worshipped. That will be the destruction and termination of the Jewish religion. Revelation 17:16 says that when Antichrist breaks the covenant with the nation of Israel, the ten kings under his hand will burn the Catholic Church. According to verse 17, by doing this, they will be fulfilling God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Religion will be terminated, but the bride will be prepared (21:2). At that time the overcomers, the firstfruits, will be raptured to the air as the bride (14:4, 14-16). We must decide whether we will be part of religion or part of the bride. I believe that today the Lord must do something new and cut off the old current of religion. The young people must prepare themselves to go either to Europe or to the college campuses in the United States. The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is to minister Christ as life and everything to His believers so that the church would be produced as a living expression of Christ on the earth in many localities. This must be carried out entirely apart from religion. The saints should not be concerned about outward matters such as the eldership, head covering, or foot-washing. We simply need to go on with Christ for the church in a new and living way. This will pave the way for the Lord to come back.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING RESCUED<br />
OUT OF THE PRESENT EVIL AGE<br />
BY EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br />
AS THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE RESCUED OUT OF<br />
THE PRESENT EVIL AGE, THE RELIGIOUS WORLD</h2>
<p>The book of Galatians deals with the present evil age, the religious world (1:4; 6:14). To try to keep the law is something of religion (2:16, 19). According to this principle, to try to do good or improve oneself to please God is religion. Circumcision also is something of religion (5:6; 6:15). This indicates that to keep any form, ritual, or regulation is religion. These two definitions of religion are great principles. Human beings seemingly cannot stay away from trying to do good or from keeping forms, rituals, and regulations. We often keep forms and rituals without realizing it. In the church life we may even attend meetings as a religious form or ritual. However, to decide not to go to a meeting is also religion. To try to do good is religion, but to try not to do good is also religion. To keep a form is religion, but not to keep the form may also be religion. We need to drop all religion. Only Christ is not religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST BEING VERSUS RELIGION</h2>
<p>In Galatians the apostle Paul says that he was formerly in religion and was even a leading one there (1:13-14). But one day it pleased God to reveal His Son in Paul (vv. 15-16). This shows that Christ is versus religion. After seeing the present evil age in Galatians 1, we see the subjective Christ&mdash;Christ revealed in us. The Christ who is versus religion is not the objective, doctrinal Christ but the subjective, experiential Christ. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Then 3:27 says that we who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Finally, 4:19 says that Christ is being formed in us. This means that Christ needs to be constituted into our being. Ephesians 3:17 reveals that Christ is making His home in our heart. Every part of our inner being&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;needs to be saturated and possessed by Christ so that He can be one with us. This is the subjective Christ who is versus religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EMPHASIS IN GALATIANS<br />
SHIFTING FROM CHRIST TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Galatians 3 the emphasis begins to shift from Christ to the Spirit. Verses 2 through 3 speak of receiving and being perfected by the Spirit, and verse 14 speaks of receiving the promise of the Spirit. God&rsquo;s blessing in the gospel is to minister the Spirit to us. When we receive the Spirit, we are born of the Spirit. Galatians 4:6 says, &ldquo;Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo; Then 5:25 says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit today is one with our spirit. The divine Spirit mingles Himself with our human spirit to be one wonderful spirit. Now we need to live and walk in this mingled spirit. Galatians 6:1 says that even when we see a brother overtaken by sin, we need to restore him in our spirit, which is mingled with the divine Spirit. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;He who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of Galatians the crucial point shifts from Christ to the Spirit. Christ and the Spirit are one, but we need to see the difference between Christ and the Spirit. The title <em>Christ,</em> which means &ldquo;the anointed One,&rdquo; implies the Lord&rsquo;s divinity and humanity. Christ as the Son of God was incarnated to be the Son of Man. He is a wonderful person with divinity and humanity. As one who is both God and man, Christ was uniquely qualified to be anointed, appointed, and commissioned by God to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>The first and the main thing that Christ did to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose was to accomplish redemption. On the cross Christ took away our sin (Heb. 9:26; John 1:29) and our sins (1 Pet. 2:24), dealt with the world (Gal. 6:14), crucified our old man (Rom. 6:6) and our old &ldquo;I&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20), destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14), and abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15). All the negative things were taken away by Christ on the cross. By accomplishing redemption, Christ, the anointed One, opened the way for God to reach us. Because God is righteous and holy, He could not do anything to be one with man until Christ had accomplished a full redemption. Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross gave God the full liberty to come in to accomplish His purpose with man.</p>
<p>After His death Christ was resurrected to impart His life into all His believers, making them His members (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 12:12). Furthermore, Christ ascended to the heavens far above all (Eph. 1:20-21). The powers on the earth and the evil powers in the air could not hold Christ. He transcended everything and ascended into the heavens, where He was made the Head over all things to the church (v. 22).</p>
<p>After accomplishing redemption, Christ became the life-giving Spirit to indwell us (1 Cor. 15:45b; John 20:22). Christ and the Spirit are two parts, which together form a complete view. To illustrate, being a student is the first part of a person&rsquo;s career. After earning a college degree, a student may enter a profession, such as teaching. Thus, the student and the teacher are two parts of a complete whole. The student and the teacher are not different persons; they are one. However, without first being a student, a person is not qualified to be a teacher. The first part qualifies a person for the second part. Likewise, to become the indwelling Spirit, Christ first had to be incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended. Christ&rsquo;s processes qualified Him to become the indwelling Spirit. For this reason, the book of Galatians first focuses on Christ and then emphasizes the Spirit. When a student becomes a teacher, it does not mean that his qualifications as a student are gone. Rather, the teacher still possesses all the qualifications of the student. Similarly, Christ, who today is the Spirit, still possesses His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The indwelling Christ is the Spirit. He is not only in us but also in the heavens. In the heavens He is the Christ; in us He is the Spirit. Christ and the Spirit are one.</p><h2 class="head1">RELIGION BEING TO DO ANYTHING<br />
APART FROM THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Religion is to do anything apart from the indwelling Spirit. To love others apart from the Spirit is religion, and not to love others apart from the Spirit is also religion. Thus, it is not easy to fully come out of religion. After hearing a message, we often make up our mind that we will change. Husbands make up their minds to be nicer to their wives; saints make up their minds to function in every meeting. All this is religion. However, to make up our mind not to do anything after hearing a message is also religion. To make up our mind apart from the Spirit is religion. Whatever we do apart from the Spirit is religion. Only what we do by the indwelling Spirit is not religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECRET TO BE SAVED FROM RELIGION<br />
BEING TO UNCEASINGLY PRAY</h2>
<p>The secret to be saved from religion is to unceasingly pray (1 Thes. 5:17). The Bible likens our prayer to breathing (Lam. 3:55-56), which never ceases. Whatever we are doing, we are still breathing. Likewise, we all must learn how to unceasingly pray. Unceasing prayer cannot be by our mind; we must learn to pray by and in our spirit. Ephesians 6:18 says, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; When we learn to pray in our spirit, we will be able to pray without ceasing. We should not care primarily for our mind, emotion, or will. Instead, we need to always exercise our spirit, turn to our spirit, and return to our spirit. Setting aside specific times to pray will help us to exercise our spirit. When we begin to pray, we may not be in the spirit, but if we keep praying, after a short while we will be in our spirit. The more we pray, the more we will be in spirit. Eventually, we will become a person who is in spirit all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING STRONG IN SPIRIT TO BE PREPARED<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>We may be stirred up, burdened, and ready to go for the Lord&rsquo;s move to Europe or to a college campus in the United States. However, before we go, we have to learn to pray to stir up our spirit, turn our being to our spirit, and call our being back into our spirit. We have to become a person who is strong not primarily in our mind, emotion, or will but in our spirit. Eventually, we will become those who live, walk, and do everything in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is good to be stirred up, but we must learn to be stirred up in our spirit, not in our emotion. If we do not exercise our spirit to control our excitement, we will act foolishly. We should not go to our college campus and shout what we have seen, nor should we meet with the pastor of a denomination to tell him that whatever he does is religion. This kind of excitement is also in religion. We need to be stirred up in the spirit and allow the spirit to control our excitement. Nothing controls us as much as our spirit. To be wise, proper, bold, or frank, we need to be in the spirit. When we are in the spirit, we will know the right time to shout and the right time to be quiet. When we are in the spirit, we will know the right time to speak at length and the right time not to say a word. The spirit tells us when to speak and when to be silent. We only need to follow the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST<br />
BEING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Galatians 6:18, the last verse of the book, says, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.&rdquo; Galatians opens with our being delivered from the present evil age, and it closes with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ being with our spirit. We all need to be delivered from the evil religious age, and we all need to enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus in our spirit. We should not care for any kind of religion or even for spirituality or overcoming sins but only for the enjoyment of the Lord Jesus in our spirit. In our spirit, instead of regulation, ritual, doctrine, or knowledge, there is grace. Grace is the Lord Jesus as our enjoyment. <em>Christ, the Spirit,</em> and <em>grace</em> all denote one person&mdash;our wonderful Savior. As Christ, He is in the heavens; as the Spirit, He is within us; as grace, He is our enjoyment.</p></body></html>
