<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Christ for the People of God's Concern</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In Isaiah</H2><P>The book of Isaiah unveils Christ in many items, mainly concerning Christ's being, that is, concerning what Christ is. Regarding Christ for the people of God's concern, in Isaiah we see that Christ is ushered in as the all-inclusive One to meet the need of the chastised Israel and of the judged nations. God is so merciful in His dealing to bring in Christ not only for Israel but also for the nations. Hence, Christ is the Savior not only of Israel but also of all the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In Daniel</H2><P>The book of Daniel reveals that Christ is the excellent One who came to be crucified for the producing of the new creation to match Him as His bride and who will come back with His bride to terminate the human government and replace it with God's eternal kingdom. In Daniel we see that Christ in His crucifixion is the landmark between God's old creation and God's new creation. In His appearing to the prophet, He was the excellent and precious One for the appreciation and expectation of the people of God. In His appearing to the human powers on the earth, He will end the human government and become the divine kingdom throughout the whole earth for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In Zechariah</H2><P>In Zechariah we see that Christ as the sent One from God is with God's suffering people to be their Redeemer. We also see that in His humiliation He goes with them through their suffering to be their Savior in a fine and sympathetic way.</P><P>The book of Zechariah does not stress Christ's being or His working. Rather, it reveals Christ as the One who was sent to Israel as their King in a lowly form but was detested, sold, attacked, and pierced, and thereby accomplished redemption for them. Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was with them in their captivity. Eventually, Christ will fight for Israel and will be King over all the earth.</P>
