<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED FOR THE VISION</H2><P>We need the vision, and we should pray much that we may have the vision. It is not adequate merely to learn how to serve. If we only learn certain things, what we learn will become something traditional and religious. It is good to learn something, but we need the vision to change what we have learned into something else.</P><P>I would ask you to pray that the Lord would grant you certain visions. First, we need the vision of Christ. We all need to see Christ, not merely have the knowledge about Christ. We also need the vision of the church, the vision of the Body, the vision of the self, and the vision of the world. Regarding the self, we need a vision of the self so that the self may be exposed to us.</P><P>We may have much knowledge about Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world, but mere knowledge about these matters does not mean anything. For example, a sinful person may have a lot of knowledge about the gospel, yet he is still not saved. Only when what this sinner knows becomes a vision will he be saved. It is the vision, not the knowledge, that saves. A person may be told how sinful he is and how evil his heart is, and others may point out his shortcomings to him. But even then he is not convinced. He knows about these things, but he is not saved because as yet there is no vision. One day the vision comes to him, and under that vision he is saved.</P><P>The principle is the same with hearing about Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world. Only when we have the vision of Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world will we have the reality of what we have heard. Once we have reality we will have deliverance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ASPECTS OF THE VISION OF CHRIST</H2><P>Let us now go on to consider some aspects of the vision of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Being the Center of God's Eternal Plan</H2><P>We need the vision of Christ to see that He is the center of God's eternal plan. In addition, Christ is the center of all things belonging to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Being the Embodiment of the Triune God</H2><P>Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). We all know this, but to know is one thing and to have the vision of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is another thing.</P>
