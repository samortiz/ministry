   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DOGS, EVIL WORKERS, AND THE CONCISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Philippians Paul was bold to speak not only in a positive way, but also in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, in 3:2 he said, "Beware of dogs."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus had actually been the first to speak of dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 7:6 He said, "Do not give that which is holy to the dogs."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The "dogs" here refer to the Pharisees, the religious people, the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul followed the Lord Jesus in telling us to beware of dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, the dogs had become worse than in Matthew 7.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some may wonder how we can be sure that the dogs in Philippians 3:2 refer to the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The proof is in the grammar of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul says, "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse the words "beware of" are used three times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, there are no conjunctions in this verse, only commas.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the dogs are the evil workers and that the evil workers are the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word "concision" is a contemptuous word for circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Circumcision is a term of honor, but concision is a term of contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul purposely referred to Jewish circumcision in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Jews who had been circumcised were called the concision, they were being called a people of contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the dogs are the evil workers and the evil workers are the circumcised Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was so bold as to call the Judaizers dogs and evil workers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Jewish religionists, of course, never thought of themselves in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, they considered themselves worshippers of God and workers of good, for they tried their best to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, to them circumcision was honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in this verse Paul calls them dogs and evil workers and belittles the practice of circumcision by calling it concision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>WORSHIPPING BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 3 Paul says, "For we are the circumcision, which worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and trust not in the flesh" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>. "Worship by the Spirit of God" is in contrast to the dogs; "boast in Christ Jesus" is in contrast to evil workers; and "trust not in the flesh" is in contrast to the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the revelation in these verses, anyone who tries to do something for God without being in the Spirit opposes the genuine worshippers of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the eyes of God, such a person is a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's word about not giving that which is holy to the dogs indicates that dogs are not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The holy things are not for dogs because dogs are not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to drop the concept that to be holy is simply to be sinless or right and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible to be holy means to be of God, by God, and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that is not of God, by God, and with God is not holy, for in the entire universe God is the only One who is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may be perfect and right, but still not be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only by being a person of God, by God, and with God can we be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, to be holy is to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, God the Spirit is called the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of God is God reaching man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God reaches man, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one can contact God except by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God cannot reach us except by His Spirit, and we cannot contact Him except by His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit by whom we touch God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, when He reaches us, we become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not have something of God, we are not holy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if we are related to God, we become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first time the word holy is used in the Bible is not in the book of Genesis, but in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Genesis it is difficult to find a hint that God became one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in Exodus we see that God begins to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in Exodus, many things are described as being holy: the holy place, the holy mountain, the holy tabernacle, the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Exodus many things are described as being holy because in this book God comes to man and man is brought to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be holy is absolutely a matter of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today all the religionists worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But it is very doubtful that they worship God by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Any religionist who does not worship God by the Spirit of God is a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whoever tries to do something for God or to worship God apart from the Spirit is a dog in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we see this vision, it will exercise a strict control over us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We shall be fearful and trembling and we shall say, "I dare not worship God unless I am assured that I am worshipping by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I am not in the Spirit, I shall not worship Him."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we see this, there will be a great change in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everything we do for God must be by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must have the confidence to say, "We are the circumcision of honor who worship by the Spirit of God."</S>
