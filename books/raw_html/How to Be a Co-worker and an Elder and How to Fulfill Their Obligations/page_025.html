<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Consummate the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The third thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His intensification is to consummate the New Jerusalem. According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, the unique goal of the Christian work should be the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate goal of God's eternal economy. Some preach the gospel with the goal of winning souls. Others establish seminaries with the goal of teaching theology. Still others pursue spirituality with the goal of living a spiritual life. Also, there are others whose goal is to pursue holiness.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery, what is our goal? Is it to be people who are holy? Today among Christians in general, nearly no one has a proper goal. They pursue being spiritual, being holy, preaching the gospel to win souls, and establishing seminaries to teach theology and the Bible, yet hardly anyone can say that they are doing these things with the goal of consummating the New Jerusalem. They have all missed the proper goal.</P><P>In the degradation of the church, on the negative side, there is the frustration from Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh. On the other hand, many positive, proper things have become replacements of God's eternal goal. God has only one ultimate goal, that is, the New Jerusalem. This is a very clear and definite matter in the Bible. The Bible with its sixty-six books opens with "In the beginning God...." In the beginning of the Bible there was God only and nothing else. At that time God was only in His one aspect&#151;the triune Father, Son, and Spirit. Therefore, God referred to Himself as "Us" and "Our." In Genesis 1:26 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." This indicates that God is three&#151;the Father, Son, and Spirit&#151;and therefore has the aspect of being three. Besides this, there was nothing else. At the end of the Bible, however, we reach the New Jerusalem. Between the beginning and the end, there is a course of much history with many ages, including the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law of the children of Israel, and the age of the grace of the New Testament, in which many things take place and in which God does a great deal of work. However, regardless of how many ages there are and how much work God does, He has only one goal. In the beginning of the Bible there is one single God, and at the end there is a great, corporate God&#151;the New Jerusalem.</P><P>Just as the Bible begins with God, so it ends with God. In the beginning He is a simple God, a God who is triune; at the end a city appears, and that is the corporate God. The New Jerusalem is God's enlargement and expansion, God's expression in eternity, which is the corporate God. Those who participate in the New Jerusalem are all God's children, God's kind, God's species. Today my descendants total only about forty. However, God's children are innumerable. Consider how many are in the New Jerusalem! They all are gods; they all belong to God's species. Hence, the New Jerusalem is the corporate God.</P><P>In spite of the fact that the holy Word contains such a clear revelation, most readers of the Bible disregard the New Jerusalem. Some say that the New Jerusalem is "heaven," where Christians will go after their death and where there are the golden street, pearl gates, and jasper wall. Others say that since Revelation is a mysterious book, no one can understand what the New Jerusalem is, so there is no need to pay any attention to it. They feel that since you are not a theologian, you do not have to study it. Today, the majority of Christians disregard the New Jerusalem, the tree of life, and the river of water of life. Instead, they take many other good things as replacements of the New Jerusalem. But the Lord's recovery is not like that. Today we establish the churches, edify the saints, practice the vital groups, and visit people by door-knocking, but our aim, our goal, is for the consummation of the New Jerusalem.</P>
