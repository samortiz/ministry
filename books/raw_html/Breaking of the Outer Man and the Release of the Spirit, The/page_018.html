<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO KNOW MEN</H1><P>It is crucial for a worker of the Lord to be able to know men. When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition. We have to know what kind of person he was and what he has now become. We have to know what he is saying with his mouth and what he is really saying in his heart, and what is the difference between the two. We have to know what he is trying to hide from us. We have to know his outstanding characteristics, whether he is stubborn or humble, and whether his humility is real or artificial. The effectiveness of our work very much depends on our ability to discern the spiritual condition of others. If the Spirit of God shows our spirit the condition of those who come to us, we will be able to give them a suitable word.</P><P>Whenever men came to the Lord in the Gospels, He spoke a suitable word to them. This is amazing! The Lord did not speak to the Samaritan woman about the truth of regeneration. Neither did He speak to Nicodemus about the living water. The word on regeneration was for Nicodemus, and the word on the living water was for the Samaritan woman. How fitting! To those who had never followed Him, He issued a calling. To those who wanted to follow Him, He spoke of bearing the cross. To those who volunteered, He spoke of counting the cost. To those who were hesitant to follow, He spoke of letting the dead bury the dead. The Lord has a suitable word for everyone, because He knows everyone. Whether a person comes to the Lord with a seeking heart or a prying attitude, our Lord knows him. This is the reason His word is forever effective and suitable. Our Lord is far ahead of us in dealing with men. We are following Him only from a distance. Although we are following at a distance, we still have to follow; the direction has to be the same. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we may learn to know men as He does.</P><P>If we place a soul in the hand of a brother who has no discernment of men, he will not know how to deal with him. He will only speak according to his subjectivity. If he has a certain feeling on a certain day, he will speak of this feeling to whomever he meets. If he has a favorite subject, he will speak to everyone about that subject. How can such a person do an effective work? No doctor can prescribe only one kind of medicine to all of his patients. Unfortunately, some servants of God have only one prescription. They do not understand others' illnesses, yet they try to heal them. They do not know the problem, they do not know the complexity of men, and they have never learned to know the spiritual condition of others. Nevertheless, they act as if they have a ready treatment for everyone. This is indeed foolish. We cannot expect to heal every spiritual sickness with just one spiritual prescription. This is absolutely impossible.</P><P>We should not think that those who are slow in feeling will have a difficult time discerning men, but that those who are sharp in mind will have an easy time discerning men. Neither slowness in feeling nor sharpness of mind have anything to do with discerning men. We cannot discern men with our mind or our feelings. No matter how sharp our mind is, we cannot bring the hidden things in man to light, nor can we touch the depth of man's condition.</P>
