   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIS AND ATTITUDE OF THE OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 3:21 the Lord Jesus said, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason the man-child can be upon the throne is because he has overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we will see how they overcome and what is their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 12:11 says, "And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"They overcame him."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Him" refers to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They overcame Satan by rendering him unable to do any of his work upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They overcame him 1 because of the blood of the Lamb, 2 because of the word of their testimony, and 3 because they had an attitude of not loving their soul-life even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Blood of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, "they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Victory in spiritual warfare is based upon the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blood is not only for forgiveness and salvation, it is also the basis by which we overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people may think that the blood is not of much value to those who have grown in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They suppose that some may grow to the extent that they go beyond the need of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must emphatically say that there is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No person can grow to the extent that he surpasses the need for the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's Word says, "They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The major activity of Satan against Christians is to accuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is Satan a murderer?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is he a liar and a tempter?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is he one who attacks us?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His chief work is to accuse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 12:10 says, "The accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We see here that Satan accuses the brothers day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only is he the accuser before God, but he is also the accuser in our conscience, and his accusations can cause us to become weak and completely powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He likes to accuse people to such an extent that they consider themselves useless and thus lose all their ground for fighting with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not saying that there is no need for us to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must have a keen sense toward sin, but we should not accept the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a child of God accepts Satan's accusations, he will feel that he is wrong all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he rises early in the morning, he will feel that he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he kneels down to pray, he will feel that he is wrong and does not even believe that God will answer his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he wants to speak a word in the meeting, he will feel that it is no use, because he is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When he wants to give an offering to the Lord, he wonders why he should offer anything, because God would surely not accept an offering from such a person as he.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The main concern of Christians like this is not how glorious and victorious the Lord Jesus is, but how evil and worthless they are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From morning to evening they are consumed with the thought of their own worthlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether they are working, resting, walking, reading the Scriptures, or praying, a single moment does not pass without their consideration of how worthless they are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the accusation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If Satan can keep them in such a condition, he was won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People in this state are powerless before Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we accept these accusations, we can never be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Often when we are engrossed with the thought of our own evil, it is easy for us to mistakenly consider this as Christian humility, not realizing that we are suffering the harmful effect of Satan's accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we sin, we must confess and deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we must learn another lesson; we must learn to not look upon ourselves, but only gaze upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being conscious of our self every day from morning until evening is a sickly condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the result of accepting the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the consciences of some of the Lord's children there is little feeling toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of people are not of much spiritual use.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, there are many of God's children whose consciences are so weak that they have no real awareness of the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we ask them if they have the sense of a particular sin, they cannot point to any.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet they always have the feeling that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They always feel that they are weak and worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever they think of themselves, they lose all of their peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have accepted the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever Satan gives us this kind of feeling, we are weakened and can no longer resist him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must not, therefore, lightly esteem the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His chief work is to accuse us, and he does it day and night without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He accuses us in our conscience as well as before God until our conscience becomes so weak that it cannot be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the daily life and work of a Christian, the conscience is of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 8 that if one's conscience is defiled, he is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Being destroyed does not mean eternal perishing but that a person can no longer be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He has been so weakened that he has become worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First Timothy 1 says that a man who thrusts away his conscience is shipwrecked regarding the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A ship which is wrecked cannot sail.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, whether or not a Christian can stand before God depends upon whether he has any offense in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once he accepts the accusations of Satan, his conscience is offended, and once his conscience is offended, he cannot proceed in his service nor fight for God any more.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must realize, therefore, that Satan's main work is to accuse us, and this is the work we must overcome.</S>
