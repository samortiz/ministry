This river quenched man's thirst and watered the garden that life might grow. At the beginning and the end of the Bible there are the tree of life and the river flowing with living water.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12303' href='#ref_12303'>Gen 2:10</a></span> And a river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four branches.<br><b>fn 2 </b>The river going forth from Eden signifies the river of water of life flowing forth from God (Rev. 22:1), indicating that God is the source of the living water for man to drink (cf. John 4:10; 7:37).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12304' href='#ref_12304'>Gen 2:9</a></span> And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<br><b>fn 2 </b>The second step of God's procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to place the created man in front of the tree of life, which signifies the Triune God embodied in Christ as life to man in the form of food. God's placing man in front of the tree of life indicates that God wanted man to receive Him as man's life by eating Him organically and assimilating Him metabolically, that God might become the very constituent of man's being. According to John 1:1, 4, life is in the Word, who is God Himself. This life-the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God-is Christ (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4a), who is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9). The tree of life grows along the two sides of the river of water of life (Rev. 22:1-2), indicating that it is a vine. Since Christ is a vine tree (John 15:1) and is also life, He is the tree of life. He was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection that man might have life and live by eating Him (John 10:10b; 6:51, 57, 63).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.<br><b>fn 6 par 1 </b>In Greek the word for tree here, as in 1 Pet. 2:24, means wood; it is not the word usually used for tree. In the Bible the tree of life always signifies Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God (Col. 2:9) for our food (Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). Here it signifies the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood-1 Pet. 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the life of God-John 11:25) Christ, who today is in the church, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God's redeemed people for eternity (22:2, 14).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12309' href='#ref_12309'>Rev 22:2</a></span> And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.<br><b>fn 1 </b>That the one tree of life grows on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine that spreads and proceeds along the flow of the water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy. This tree fulfills for eternity what God intended from the beginning (Gen. 2:9). The tree of life was closed to man because of his fall (Gen. 3:22-24), but it was opened to the believers through the redemption of Christ (Heb. 10:19-20). Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers' common portion (John 6:35, 57). In the millennial kingdom the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be a dispensational reward to the overcoming believers (2:7). Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be the eternal portion of all God's redeemed (vv. 14, 19). Christ as the tree of life is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. This is all in and with the divine nature as our holy way, signified by the street. This is the supply of the holy city, and this is the way the city is supplied.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12310' href='#ref_12310'>John 7:38</a></span> He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.<br><b>fn 2 </b>The rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life (cf. Rom. 15:30; 1 Thes. 1:6; 2 Thes. 2:13; Gal. 5:22-23), originating from the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is God's Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12311' href='#ref_12311'>Exo 17:1</a></span> And all the assembly of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin by their stages according to the command of Jehovah and encamped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.<br><b>fn 2 </b>After the children of Israel had eaten the manna to satisfy their hunger (ch. 16), they needed to drink the living water to quench their thirst. In both physical life and spiritual life eating and drinking should always go together. At the beginning of the Bible, the tree of life and the manna are mentioned before the water of life (Gen. 2:9-10; Exo. 16:4, 14-15; 17:6; cf. John 6:31-35; 7:37-39), indicating that in the beginning of our spiritual life our eating of Christ in His word (Jer. 15:16; Matt. 4:4; John 6:63) issues in the flowing of the Spirit as the living water within us. However, at the end of the Bible the river of water of life is mentioned before the tree of life (Rev. 22:1-2), and the tree of life grows in (i.e., is conveyed in) the river, indicating that as we progress in spiritual experience, the Spirit as the flowing river brings us the supply of the word, the manna. This implies that ultimately in the divine concept eating is included in drinking and drinking is more important than eating.<br>In the Bible the basic principle concerning man's relationship with God is that man needs to eat and drink of God. It is by eating and drinking that we, God's chosen people, take God into us, and it is through our eating and drinking Him that God works Himself into us to be one with us organically.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12312' href='#ref_12312'>Rev 22:1</a></span> And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.<br><b>fn 3 </b>The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply. It is typified by the water that came out of the riven rock (Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:11) and symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus (John 19:34). Here, the water of life becomes a river, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Thus this city is filled with the divine life that it may express God in His glory of life.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12313' href='#ref_12313'>Rev 22:1</a></span> And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.<br><b>fn 6 </b>The street of the holy city is pure gold (21:21). Gold symbolizes the divine nature. That the river of water of life proceeds in the middle of its street signifies that the divine life flows in the divine nature as the unique way for the daily life of God's redeemed people. Where the divine life flows, there the divine nature is as the holy way by which God's people walk; and where the holy way of the divine nature is, there the divine life is flowing. The divine life and the divine nature as the holy way always go together. Thus, God's river of water of life is available along this divine way, and we enjoy the river by walking in this way of life.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
