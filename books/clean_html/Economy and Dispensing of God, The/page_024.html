<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THROUGH CRUCIFIXION</H2><P>After His incarnation, Christ lived on this earth for more than thirty years. Then He went to the cross and was crucified there. This was the second step of God's dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ as the Lamb of God<br>Taking Away Men's Sin</H2><P>In His crucifixion, Christ as the Lamb of God first took away our sin (John 1:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ as the Serpent Destroying Satan,<br>the Ruler of this World</H2><P>Second, as the brass serpent, Christ destroyed Satan, the source of death and the ruler of this world (John 12:31; Heb. 2:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ as the Grain of Wheat Releasing<br>the Divine Life for the Producing<br>of Many Believers by Imparting (Dispensing)<br>the Divine Life into Them</H2><P>Third, as the grain of wheat, Christ released the divine life within Him for the producing of the many believers by imparting, that is, dispensing, the divine life into them (John 12:24). By this He made all the believers His members and the many grains of wheat.</P><P>Many Christians do not realize that Christ's death, like His incarnation, was for His dispensing. He died on the cross to release His divine life for His dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Blood That Came out of Christ<br>at His Crucifixion Symbolizing<br>the Redeeming Aspect of<br>Christ's All-inclusive Death, and<br>the Water That Came out of Christ<br>Symbolizing the Life-imparting Aspect of<br>Christ's All-inclusive Death</H2><P>At the cross, when the soldier pierced the side of Christ, blood and water came out (John 19:34). The blood symbolizes the redeeming aspect of Christ's all-inclusive death, and the water that came out of Christ symbolizes the life-imparting aspect of Christ's all-inclusive death. This one death did two works: it redeemed us from our sins, and it released the divine life of God into the believers.</P>
