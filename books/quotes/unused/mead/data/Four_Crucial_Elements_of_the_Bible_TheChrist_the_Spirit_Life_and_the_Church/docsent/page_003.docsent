   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's life is God Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because I have another person in me, the heavenly God Himself who is my person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I am displeased or unhappy and try to speak something unpleasant, this person who is in me says, "You may speak, but I won't speak; you may go to quarrel, but I won't go."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, I can only say, "Lord, if You won't go, then I won't go either."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the Lord may say, "Wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since you won't go, stay here and I will be with you."</S>
