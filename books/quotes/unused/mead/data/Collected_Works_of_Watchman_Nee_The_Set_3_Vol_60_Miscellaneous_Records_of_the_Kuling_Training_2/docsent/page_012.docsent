   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 7 Date: August 21, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling A WORD OF WISDOM AND A WORD OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: What is the meaning of the terms "a word of wisdom" and "a word of knowledge" in 1 Corinthians 12:8?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: First Corinthians 12:8 says, "For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Words of knowledge are words given by the Holy Spirit to relate facts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Words of wisdom are words given by the Holy Spirit to explain the reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Words of knowledge involve "what," and words of wisdom involve "why."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>DEFILEMENT OF FLESH AND OF SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Question: What is the defilement of flesh and the defilement of spirit in 2 Corinthians 7:1?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Answer: The defilement of flesh is a defilement that originates from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this defilement the flesh takes an active role.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Defilement of spirit is an outside defilement that invades the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this defilement the spirit takes a passive role; it is acted upon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once the flesh is defiled, the spirit is contaminated, defiled, and cannot rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Question: What is the proper way to exercise supernatural power?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Answer: If supernatural power matches the operation of our spirit within, this power can be of use to us, and it is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If it does not match our spirit, we cannot use it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GIFT, MINISTRY, AND OPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Question: What is the difference between gift, ministry, and operation?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Answer: Gifts are what the Holy Spirit Himself imparts to man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are not something that a man possesses in himself, and they are objective in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit puts these gifts directly in man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a man receives a gift, he is empowered to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ministry is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every saved person has a ministry assigned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gifts are for the fulfillment of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We fulfill our ministry by the gifts given by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A gift is unrelated to the person receiving it; it is objective, having been placed directly in man by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a man serves the Lord according to this gift, he has a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here is a problem: Some people have gifts, but they do not necessarily use them in the way of a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a man's exercise of his gift is not under the Lord's authority, his gift is not being employed in the way of ministry because ministry always subjects itself to the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Corinthians had gifts, but they did not have any ministry because they did not come under the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man must first subject himself to the Lord's authority before he can exercise his gift to fulfill his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under the right conditions, a gift fulfills a ministry, and the ministry becomes part of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what operation is; it is simply part of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>INSTANT UTTERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: Can we rely on instant utterance?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Answer: If a man has learned his lessons before the Lord, his instant utterance will be a residual deposit of the light he receives from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are trained by the Lord can turn the residual light they receive from the Holy Spirit into knowledge and make it a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man has not learned his lessons from God, the instant words that he receives are probably products of his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are probably something from his brain or some arguments concerning the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such words will not render others any supply or benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether or not a church is strong depends on the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The whole burden rests on the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the ministers are poor and do not minister God's word, the church will be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church in Corinth we only find the gift of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, there was only the ministry of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul prophesied according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He had the word of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He also taught according to the knowledge derived from this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what God wants to see in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The speaking in the church must at least be teachings based on knowledge, which is derived from revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A better kind of speaking is that which is based on the reminding of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This speaking will bring light to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ministry of the word that we are referring to here is absolutely subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to speak God's past words, and we have to speak God's present words.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In delivering our words we have to be strong, and our utterance has to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we deliver the words sentence by sentence, we have to make them the outflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more we speak, the lighter our inward burden should become.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The result should be a kind of unloading and relief.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How God judges our ministry and whether or not it will touch others is something beyond our control; this is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The important thing for us to know is the kind of person we are and whether or not we have received a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is very subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to be inwardly clear concerning the way we take.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to learn our lessons before God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to start with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we accept the dealings and learn our lessons, these dealings and lessons will become part of our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If, however, we have not learned anything ourselves, we only will have empty truths.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Until we deal with this issue, we cannot face other problems.</S>
