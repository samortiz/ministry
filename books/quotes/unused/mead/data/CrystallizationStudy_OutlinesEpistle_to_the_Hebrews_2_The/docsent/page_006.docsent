   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of Hebrews reveals that we may experience Christ at the altar and at the laver in the outer court in an outward way, at the showbread table, at the lampstand, and at the incense altar in the Holy Place in an inner way, and at the ark of the testimony and in the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies in the innermost way Heb 9:2-4.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the ark in the Holy of Holies, we experience the processed and consummated Triune God the Father in His divine nature as the source of all supply, Christ as the hidden manna and the resurrection life, and the Spirit of life as the inner law of life: The golden pot signifies the divine nature, the nature of God the Father, who is the unique source Heb 9:4b; 2 Pet 1:4; Matt 6:4, 6, 18; 1 Cor 8:6a; Eph 3:14-15.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to enjoy Christ not only as the table, the lampstand, and the ark but also as the incense altar: As a divine motor, the incense altar is the place from which the activities in all other places in the tabernacle and the outer court are motivated.</S>
