   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE NEW WAY AND THE SERVICE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WORSHIP IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: John 4:20-21, 23-24; Luke 2:37; Phil 3:3; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:26 OUTLINE Worship in the New Testament: The Old Testament worship being a matter of a physical place John 4:20.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament worship being a matter of the human spirit John 4:21, 23-24.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those in the Old Testament worshipping the God in the temple Luke 2:37.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those in the New Testament worshipping the God in Christ who is the God-man Phil 3:3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way to worship in the New Testament: Having no form of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having no outward set program or procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Serving only by the Spirit of God Phil 3:3: The small group meetings being mainly for the perfecting of the saints Eph 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Prophesying being mainly for the building up of the church 1 Cor 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BEING UNIVERSAL</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that the Lord s ordained way always matches the economy that He is after.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have also seen that God s New Testament economy is to have every saved person be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Testament priesthood is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There should not be only a group of people who are priests while the others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, everyone should be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not matter how young you are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as you are a saved person, having the Lord s life, you are a member of the Body of Christ and therefore a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To the Lord, you are His member.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To God, you are His priest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Also, a priest is one who is joined to God as one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has entered into us and has brought us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We mutually abide in each other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We and God and God and we have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By this, we become a people who belong to God and who serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OFFERING UP SINNERS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A priest is one who serves God, and to serve God is to offer up sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word priest carries the sense of one who is managing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A priest is one who manages the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is one with God and receives a commission from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is not only sent from God but is one who serves with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His specific work is the managing of the offerings of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Old Testament, the offerings were the bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We know that the Old Testament priests and offerings were all types; they were not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reality had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not until four thousand years after the creation of Adam did Christ come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then was the time fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time, the reality came.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the angel announced to Mary that she would conceive a child, who was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Christ came, all the types in the Old Testament were fulfilled and realized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no more need for the types.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hebrews 10:7 says, Behold, I come...to do Your will, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the context we see that God s will here is that Christ fulfill and replace all the Old Testament sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From now on, there are no more sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is only one true sacrifice left, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the New Testament priests no longer offer bulls and goats for sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, they offer the fallen sinners treasured and chosen by God before the foundation of the earth as sacrifices Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, these sinners cannot in themselves become the sacrifices, for they have all sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know that the sacrifices are for the dealing with, the removal of, and the redemption from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank God for His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After He saved us, He put us into Christ so that we have a change in position.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are no longer in Adam; we are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we are in Christ, God can justify and accept us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While we were yet sinners, we were not the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But when we are in Christ, we are the sacrifices acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, many times in Paul s Epistles he mentions us being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, Colossians 1:28 says, Warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we are in ourselves, we are not qualified to be offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But whenever we are in Christ, we can be offered up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can even be presented full-grown.</S>
