   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Colossians 1:13 contrasts two things the authority of darkness and the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We were in the authority of darkness, but one day we were transferred into the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes a contrast enables us to understand things more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By seeing the negative we can know the positive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom of God is in contrast with the authority of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not merely a dispensation or a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The kingdom is something so real.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the realization of the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of you have been told that you were in Adam and that one day God transferred you out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now you need to realize further that since you are in Christ, you are also in the kingdom because Christ is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose there is a naughty boy, born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day he hears the gospel, calls upon the name of the Lord and is transferred out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was born in Adam, but now he is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although this young brother has been transferred into Christ, he may lack the proper realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Doctrinally, when he is in Christ, he is also in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Experientially however, he may have been in Christ for five years, but still may not be in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has been transferred into Christ, yet he is still disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once he was a naughty boy; now he is a naughty brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot say that he is not in Christ or that he is not a brother, but experientially he is not in the kingdom because he does not realize the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he realizes the reality of the Lord Jesus, he will be not only in Christ, but also in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be in the kingdom means to have a full realization of the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus said that if He cast out demons by the Spirit, then the kingdom of God was come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A demon is a dirty, unclean, evil spirit, but the principle of being a demon simply means rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Originally, demons were a kind of created being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Satan rebelled against God, they followed him and became demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, demons indicate rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If in your daily walk there are some things which are not under God's ruling, some things still in rebellion against God, those things in principle are demons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They need to be cast out by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must pray, "Lord Jesus, come and cast out my demons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even today I am rebellious."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may be rebellious in your shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps you went to the department store although the Lord Jesus within you told you not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once in the store, you picked up an item and even though the Lord Jesus told you to drop it, you bought it, and you still have it at home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is rebellion, the principle of a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are you always under the ruling of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say that we love Him yet not accept His ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may say that Christ is our life, but Christ as our life may not be very real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It may simply be a term, not a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There may be no realization of the reality of Christ being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life of the Lord Jesus is a ruling life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In every kind of life there is a ruling element which is its life law and regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may have the life of Christ within and yet not be under the ruling of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So, in a sense, we may be still possessed by many demons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need the Lord Jesus to cast them out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we will truly be in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The kingdom is the realization of the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have been transferred out of darkness into the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet, in our daily living, we may lack the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reality of the kingdom is simply the realization of the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we have the realization of the reality of the Lord Jesus, that realization is the kingdom.</S>
