<h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN CHRISTIANITY<br />
FORCING GOD TO REACT</h2>
<p>According to our observation, the concept of the brothers in the churches has not changed sufficiently in regard to serving by and in the spirit. It seems as if the exercise of their spirit always lags behind the use of their intellect, reason, emotion, feelings, and will. This is a great problem with us, and it is an even greater problem in Christianity as a whole. It is no wonder then that God has reacted in response to this situation. One example of God&rsquo;s reaction has been His allowance of the emergence of the Pentecostal movement. In this reaction emphasis on the Spirit overpowered all other considerations and all emphasis on the intellect was put aside. Nevertheless, God still allowed this reaction to occur even though it went too far. When we consider the Pentecostal movement solely from the aspect of the Spirit, we must realize that Christianity had fallen into a situation of dead knowledge, ordinances, rituals, regulations, and doctrines. Consequently, meetings that stressed such things as sitting quietly with a Bible, singing hymns, and listening to intellectual messages forced God to raise up an environment, a movement, to overthrow this emphasis on objective things.</p>
<p>Although we may not agree with everything associated with the Pentecostal movement, we must admit that the reaction associated with this movement occurred with God&rsquo;s permission. For example, in meetings where everyone was sitting so properly in their chairs, God reacted by causing some to roll on the floor. Many criticized these ones, saying that it was wrong to roll on the floor and jump in the meeting, but a considerable number were saved in their midst. In contrast, many who were brought into the denominations by &ldquo;proper&rdquo; pastors were not even genuinely saved. Those brought into the Pentecostal movement, however, truly repented and were saved. Even though some came from very dark backgrounds, including addiction to opium and possession by demons, all of this darkness fell away after their Pentecostal experiences related to salvation. Even though many of their practices are questionable, we should not deny that they are related to God&rsquo;s reaction to the situation in Christianity.</p>
<p>Even though we are God&rsquo;s children, having been regenerated with God&rsquo;s life and serving Him in some capacity, we must admit that our spirit is still rather weak. When we come together, we are either focused on intellectual or emotional things. In other words, our soul is the leading part of our being, not our spirit. This is an undeniable fact. Hence, the leading in our meetings is very poor, and it is difficult for our spirit to be living. This is true not only in the young people&rsquo;s meeting but also when the whole church comes together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THOSE WHO ARE IN THE MEETING<br />
TO PRAY AND OPEN THEIR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Acts 6:4 says, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; Prayer is a matter of the spirit, whereas the ministry of the word is a matter related to knowledge and the mind. Today, however, it seems as if we carry out only the ministry of the word and neglect the matter of prayer. Although we do not know whether the apostles prayed before or after a meeting, we know that they prayed. Consequently, when we bear responsibility for a meeting, we must endeavor to lead those who are in the meeting to pray; we must lead them into the matter of prayer.</p>
<p>In the past we suffered because we would bring people to the meetings but not lead them to pray. In one of the meeting halls in Taipei, there are at least sixty people who attend the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. According to observation, however, half of them never open their mouth. This is a fact. Among the sixty who break bread, thirty never open their mouth. If this is the situation in the bread-breaking meeting, it is even more noticeable in the ministry meeting, where many come and only listen to a message. Of the three to four hundred who come to the ministry meeting, less than one hundred pray. In other words, less than twenty-five percent of those who listen to the messages exercise to pray in the meeting. Some saints have been in this condition for many years. Although they may have listened to messages for ten years, they have never prayed in a meeting. Messages have been continually released, but their spirit has not been open. It is no wonder that the word cannot penetrate their being. This is like a person who tries to take food into his stomach through his nostrils rather than his mouth. Such an effort will have no effect. Similarly, we have been giving messages for many years, but there has been little to no effect.</p>
<p>This is the same situation in relation to our gospel preaching. Some come to our gospel meetings every week to listen to our speaking, but we do not lead them to pray. Hence, it is very difficult for them to be saved. We do not need to wait for another week to pass; we can preach the gospel and immediately lead our gospel friends to open their mouth and pray. When we preach the gospel to others, it is imperative that we open their spirit through the exercise of the spirit. As soon as their spirit is open, they will be saved. This is a basic principle in leading people to salvation.</p>
