   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Deut 1:1; 8:3; 30:14; 2 Tim 3:16a; John 1:1; Rom 10:8-9; Matt 4:4; John 6:63b, 57b</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will give an introductory word to the life-study of Deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE CONCLUDING BOOK OF THE PENTATEUCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Deuteronomy is the concluding book of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These five books were written by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Deuteronomy is a book primarily of plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that, generally speaking, it is not a book of types, figures, and shadows, and neither is it deep in the matter of prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nearly all the chapters of this book consist of plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may think that plain words are easier to understand than types and figures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the plain words in the Bible are more difficult to understand than the pictures shown in the types and figures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does the word Deuteronomy mean?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Literally, Deuteronomy means "second law" and thus signifies a respeaking, a repeated speaking, a speaking again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of Deuteronomy is a respeaking, not of ordinary words, but of the divine law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law was given through Moses the first time when he was eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Forty years later, after the first generation, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua, had died out, the law was again related to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, Moses was facing those of the younger generation, most of whom had not been present to hear the giving of the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, God burdened Moses to relate the law again, to rehearse it, to respeak it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This repeating of the law was surely meaningful and significant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not think that only Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Bible, is a deuteronomy, a respeaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the entire Bible is a deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should therefore regard the whole Bible of sixty-six books as a deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The writing of the Bible was completed nineteen hundred years ago, but when we read the Bible today, we experience a respeaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word in the Bible has already been spoken, but it is respoken to us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that every day we may have a deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, the book of Romans was written nearly two thousand years ago, but when we read Romans today, the word in this epistle is spoken to us again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that in our reading of Romans we have a deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To say that we may have a respeaking of the Bible does not mean that anything can be added to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The claim of Joseph Smith to have had a revelation in addition to what is in the Bible is nonsensical and heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 22:18 and 19 indicate that the entire revelation of God has been completed and that no one should add anything or take away anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we should not think that we can receive a new revelation in addition to what is recorded in the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What we can have today is a deuteronomy, a respeaking of the word in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word has already been spoken, but it can now be respoken to us; that is, it can become to us a deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Deuteronomy is a conclusion to the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apart from Deuteronomy, these four books would not have a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you think Moses' writing could have concluded with Genesis?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Genesis ends with a man in a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely the divine revelation could not conclude in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For a proper conclusion, the book of Deuteronomy is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Deuteronomy is an all-inclusive conclusion of the four preceding books, for Deuteronomy is a totality of the thought of these books.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, if we would understand the thought of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, we need to come to Deuteronomy.</S>
