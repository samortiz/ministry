   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE LEADERSHIP IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament reveals clearly that when the church is degraded, we need to walk not only according to the Spirit, but also in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last two Epistles of John were written after degradation had come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John lived longer than the other apostles, and these Epistles were written near the end of his life, much later than 1 and 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time the church had already sunk deeply into degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is significant that in these Epistles John does not mention the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, he speaks of the truth again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, he says, The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; for the truth s sake, which abideth in us, and shall be with us forever 2 John 1-2, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>. In verse 2 John specifically mentions the truth abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows the importance of truth during a time of degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then John goes on to say, For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth 3 John 3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Especially when the church is degraded, we need to walk in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During times of degradation, there is nothing but darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, there is the urgent need for light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we walk in darkness, we may be injured.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You could very easily get hurt if you walk on an unlighted street at night.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible reveals that truth is of crucial importance during the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to know the truth and to walk in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1 and 2 Timothy the Apostle Paul began to emphasize the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although truth is mentioned frequently in these Epistles, the Spirit is rarely mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have pointed out, in 2 and 3 John the Spirit is not mentioned at all, although the other writings of the Apostle John reveal that he was absolutely for life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Recently, some have said that we should only drink the Spirit and not take the word of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One person has even suggested that eventually some may no longer use the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In times of darkness and degradation we need the Word to shine forth with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The truth must be our guide.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, those who have been deceived are saying that we should not take the principles of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that they do not receive the truth, and it exposes the fact that they are not in the way of the truth, but in the way of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CUTTING STRAIGHT THE WORD OF TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul issued a charge: Be eager to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, cutting straight the word of the truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>. Every Bible student pays attention to this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I was young, the Brethren teachers stressed the importance of cutting straight the word of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul charged Timothy in this way because the truth regarding any matter is not found all in one place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, it is found throughout various books of the Bible, with a part in one place and another part in a different place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His wisdom the Lord reveals the truth in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps He did this so that those who are careless will have difficulty knowing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To know truth we must be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, Paul charged Timothy to be eager.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some say we should not be strict or legal in studying the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They insist that we should read the Bible only when we are inspired by the Spirit to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is like saying that there is no need to eat three meals a day, but a need to eat only when the Spirit inspires us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that if there is no inspiration, we should not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul, on the contrary, charges us to be eager.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are truly eager to present ourselves approved to God, then when we read the Word, we shall find the truth revealed in one place after another, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to put all these pieces together in order to see the picture, the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to Isaiah 28:13, the word of the Lord is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that we find the truth a little at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In reading the Bible and in knowing the truth, I am very aggressive, more aggressive and more eager than I was years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because I am so eager to get into the depths of the Word, sometimes my wife must call me several times before I come to breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Word is like an inexhaustible gold mine; I am always finding something new in it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to be eager to get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul s charge about cutting straight the word of truth was spoken to Timothy, a young co-worker, one who had been commissioned by Paul to help the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you would be such a servant of the Lord, you need to be eager to present yourself approved to God in knowing the truth and in cutting straight the word of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first qualification of one commissioned to help the churches is the proper knowledge of the word of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No doubt, the cutting straight of the word of truth is not only for our personal understanding of the Bible, but also for teaching others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to learn how to put all the puzzle pieces together in order to make a clear picture for others to see.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many Christians have read through the Bible without seeing the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They have the pieces, but no way to put them together.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need to get into the Word, find the pieces, and put them together so that others may see the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is to cut straight the Word.</S>
