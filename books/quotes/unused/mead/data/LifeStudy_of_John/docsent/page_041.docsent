   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. All the Regenerated Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Becoming One as the Bride of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Given Him by God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John wrote his gospel under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By his words we can see that all the regenerated followers of Christ are His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29, and the bride there is a living composition of all the regenerated people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that in this chapter on regeneration, regeneration is not only to bring the divine life into the believers and annul the satanic nature in their flesh, but also to make them the corporate bride for Christ s increase.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last two points, to annul the serpentine nature in the believers and to make them the bride of Christ, are both fully developed in John s writing of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The book of Revelation mainly reveals how Satan as the old serpent will be fully eliminated Rev 20:2, 10 , and how the bride of Christ as the New Jerusalem will be fully produced Rev 21:2, 10-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although most Christians are familiar with regeneration in John 3, very few see that each regenerated person should be a part of the increase of Christ, which is His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regeneration is for the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is for the producing of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Regeneration is for you to be a part of the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 3 is a chapter of regeneration for the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians only see regeneration itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not see the purpose of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is regeneration just for you to have eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is for something more.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regeneration is for us to be built into the bride, which is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Originally we all were little serpents with a serpentine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By regeneration, the serpentine nature has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We saw this clearly in the last message.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, in regeneration we all have been germinated with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since our serpentine nature has been terminated and since we have been germinated with the divine life, we are all a part of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are you a serpentine person or are you a part of the bride of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are parts of the bride!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are parts of the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Gospel of John is a book about the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ as the bridegroom needs a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He came for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He came for His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How will He obtain His increase?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By entering into us and making us a part of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all are parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As parts of Christ composed together, we are the bride of Christ, His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both salvation and regeneration are for this purpose, for the bride as the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. The Bride of Christ Being His Increase</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The bride of Christ is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of the reborn people are the increase of Christ, and this increase is the bride which becomes the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The bride is the church, the composition of all the regenerated people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All those who are regenerated are composed together as the corporate bride to match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without regeneration, Christ cannot have a bride as His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The bride as the increase of Christ is like Eve who was the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Adam was first created, he was single a so-called bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Adam s single state, there was no increase.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After God took a rib out of Adam and built a woman with it, this woman was married to Adam Gen 2:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once she was joined to Adam, she became the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Adam then had an increase and was no longer single.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ also was single, and so He made a bride to be the increase of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But who is the increase, the bride, of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only those who are regenerated with Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through regeneration we possess the divine life of God which is Christ Himself, thus becoming members of the corporate bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Later, the same writer, in the book of Revelation, says that the bride of Christ, the bride of the Lamb, is the New Jerusalem 21:2, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Again, it is the composition of all those who have been born again through the regeneration of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have been regenerated, you are part of the increase of Christ, a member of the corporate bride of Christ, which is the church today and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How can we become the increase of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We repeat once again that the increase of Christ is produced through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, when we were born of our parents, we were the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you realize that Adam is increasing every day?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Have you ever thought of how large Adam is today?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>About six thousand years ago, when Adam was alone in the garden of Eden, he was single, a bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, down through the generations, Adam has acquired many descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All his descendants are his increase.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today, counting only the living ones, Adam has increased to about three billion people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Adam has increased to be such a big Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord that Christ is increasing also.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But He is not increased by our first birth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our first birth is for the increase of Adam; our second birth is for the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When you have a child, that is another person for the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, you must thank the Lord for another possibility: this once-born one may also be born again for the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Potentially, all of your children can be born again into the increase of Christ as well as into the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Are you the increase of Adam, or are you the increase of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Formerly, we had to say that we were just the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now, thank the Lord, we are the increase of Christ through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, we must also make sure that we live, walk, and do things, not by the life of Adam, but by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As long as we live by our human life, we are merely the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is only as we live and walk by God s divine life that we are the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then we shall be the bride as the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As a wife is one flesh with her husband, so we are one spirit with Christ 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As the wife is the increase of the husband, so we, as His bride, are the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Due to the fact that we have Christ as life through the second birth, we are the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore the ultimate result of regeneration is that Christ has a bride as His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Christ is increased through regeneration because by regeneration He is reproduced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We, the regenerated people, are His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Eve could be the increase of Adam because she was constituted with the rib of Adam and became one flesh with Adam, a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the same principle, we can be the increase of Christ because we are spiritually constituted with the life of Christ and have become one spirit with Him, a part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As Eve came out of Adam and returned to be one with Adam, thus becoming Adam s increase, so we also have come out of Christ and will return to be one with Him, thus becoming His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This increase is just His reproduction in us through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All the people who participate in this reproduction are given to Christ by God.</S>
