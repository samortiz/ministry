   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Mysticism Having Invaded</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Church at Colosse</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, mysticism had invaded the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This mysticism was related to Gnosticism, which was composed of Egyptian, Babylonian, Jewish, and Greek philosophies 2:8 and to the worship of angels 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The vital point concerning the background of the book of Colossians is that culture had been brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The population of Colosse was a mixture of Gentiles and Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Gentiles and the Jews had different cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the most part, the Gentiles were under the influence of Greek culture with its philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, however, Greek philosophy was no longer pure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather it was a mingling of various philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the Gentile culture was at least somewhat blended with Jewish religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This mixture of cultures flooded the church at Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church should be a house filled with Christ and constituted with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, the church there had been invaded by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To a large extent, Christ as the unique element in the church life was being replaced by various aspects of this mixed culture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The constituent of the church should be Christ and Christ alone, for the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the content of the church should be nothing other than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, the good elements of culture, especially philosophy and religion, had invaded the church and saturated it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In particular, a type of religious asceticism had made inroads into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 20 and 21, which speak of ordinances regarding handling, tasting, and touching, refer to this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know that this asceticism was religious in nature because it was related to the worship of angels 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the asceticism that flooded the church in Colosse was not crude, but refined and cultured.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To some, the worship of angels may seem quite good, far superior to the worship of reptiles, birds, and beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, angel worship is idolatry, although a somewhat refined type of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People of high culture do not worship animals, but they may be open to worship angels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some justify such a practice by saying that they do not worship idols, but, in humility, worship the heavenly servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regarding themselves as too low to worship God directly, they may feel that they must worship Him through an intermediary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This concept has been assimilated into Catholicism, which teaches that we may need the help of an intermediary in order to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In principle at least, Catholicism has adopted the practice of using an intermediary in the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the subtlety of the enemy to flood the church with the elements of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what he was doing when the book of Colossians was written.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His strategy was to send a mixture of Jewish religion and Gentile philosophy into the church and to saturate the church with this cultural mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the human point of view, this culture, particularly its asceticism, was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Asceticism has a good purpose and goal; it attempts to enable people to deal with their lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we must see that Satan s strategy in flooding the church with culture is to use the most highly developed aspects of culture to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not think that this phenomenon was limited to the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is still with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In today s Christianity Christ has been almost altogether replaced by other things, especially by good things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The name of Christ may be found in Christianity, but the reality of Christ may be absent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many things have become substitutes for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, even the teaching of the Bible is used by the enemy of God as such a substitute for Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians study the Bible without contacting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Due to Satan s subtlety, any kind of Christian work can also replace Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christian work should minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, some Christian works make their particular goal a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In today s religion some pastors and ministers may allow their own personalities to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Certain Christian workers have attractive, powerful personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They use their personalities to draw people not to Christ, but to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the reason that many Christians compliment and even praise the personalities of certain pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who do not have such a strong personality may attract people by their niceness or their humility.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christians may choose to attend a particular so-called church because the minister there is kind and sympathetic.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We in the Lord s recovery may substitute the good aspects of our character or behavior for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If anyone who serves the Lord is sinful or proud, others will be frustrated from coming to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the natural meekness or humility of such a serving one is even more damaging and frustrating than his sinfulness or pride.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone realizes that nothing sinful can be related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But not many can discern the difference between good character or behavior and Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the contrary, many identify excellent behavior with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, if we are short of revelation, our good character may become a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because the church is composed of human beings, it is difficult for the church to be separated from society, which is a composition of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yes, as the church, we are separated from the world; we are in the world, but not of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, the church must remain in society.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The believers should not live like monks or nuns.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to have the church life, we must have a normal human living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The issue at hand is how a unit of people can be in society without being influenced by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How can we be saved from the influence of our cultural background?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As believers in the Lord, we do love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nevertheless, we may have a special love for those with a background similar to ours.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Through such an influence operating in the church life, Christ is replaced by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians, a number of isms were exerting their influence: Judaism, asceticism, mysticism, Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These isms were among the highest products of both Jewish and Gentile cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Being good things, they spontaneously became replacements for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, Paul s purpose in the book of Colossians is to show that in the church nothing should be allowed to be a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church life must be constituted uniquely of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He should be our only constituent and our very constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the reason that in this short Epistle a number of elevated expressions are used to describe Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For example, He is called the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the firstborn from among the dead, and the body of all the shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In 3:10 and 11, Paul says that in the new man there is no possibility of having Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or freeman.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, in the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that Christ must be everyone and in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the new man there is no room for Chinese, Japanese, American, British, French, or Germans.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Christ must be every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the new man Christ must be you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Not only must culture go, but even we have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is crucial that we see this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need to heed Paul s warning to beware of anything that will carry us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Sisters, beware of your kindness, gentleness, and sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Beware of any human virtues that replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brothers, beware of your sound mind, strong will, boldness, and any other virtues that are substitutes for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What subtlety of the enemy to tempt us into trying to be nice, gentle, mild, or attractive!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Nevertheless, many preachers and ministers teach and practice this very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It seems that such kind, humble, cultivated people attract others to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Actually, they succeed only in attracting people to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>No one drawn to them is truly gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I am concerned that even in the churches in the Lord s recovery some may be attracted to the church life not by Christ, but by the character or behavior of certain brothers or sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The main point in the Epistle of Colossians is the fact that in the eyes of God nothing counts except Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This fact excludes both good things and bad things, both sinful things and cultured things.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In particular, it eliminates all the good aspects of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have pointed out again and again that the enemy of God utilizes culture to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is offensive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If Satan cannot corrupt us with evil things, God knows that he will try to use the good aspects of culture to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Among today s Christians, where can you find a group of believers with whom you can sense nothing but Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Among the various Christian groups we see many good points.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, these good things are not the Person of Christ Himself, but something that has replaced Him in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>For this reason, in many groups of Christians it is difficult to meet Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Some may preach Christ or teach the doctrines regarding Christ, but even this preaching and teaching becomes a substitute for Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we have a clear view of the situation among Christians today, we shall realize that the background of the book of Colossians exactly corresponds to today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This book was written for us, not only for the saints at Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we have a clear understanding of the background of this Epistle, we shall realize that the only way for us to take is the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The cross is both a narrow way and a highway.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>For those not willing to take the cross, the cross is a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But for those who are willing to take this way, the cross becomes a highway.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In the church we all should be nothing and nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This was Paul s attitude when he said that we have died and have been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>To lay hold of this, we need revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do can become a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The better we are or the more capable we are of doing things, the more Christ may be replaced in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Through the cross, we need to become nothing, to have nothing, and to be able to do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Otherwise, what we are, what we have, or what we can do will become a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then in our Christian life Christ will not be all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The book of Colossians teaches us that in the church life Christ must be all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Everything that is not Christ must go.</S>
