   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DINE WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND TO SIT ON HIS THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we come to the church in Laodicea, the church in degradation 3:14-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek Laodicea means the opinion, the judgment, of the people or of the laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church in Laodicea as a sign prefigures the degraded recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Less than a century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered churches assemblies became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church signified by the church in Sardis, and also differs from the proper recovered church signified by the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It will exist until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some Christian teachers consider the church in Laodicea as the cold reformed church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Strictly speaking, this is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the context and according to history, the church in Laodicea must be a sign of the degraded recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Approximately one hundred fifty years ago the recovered church began in England.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to what we have read, it was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was a real recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, it did not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you read the history of the Brethren and if you visit them today, you will see that many of the Brethren assemblies have become the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we shall see, although they are proud of their Bible knowledge, they are poor in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ and blind in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I. THE SPEAKER A. The Amen</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 3:14 the Lord says, These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To each of the seven churches the Lord refers to what He is and what He does respectively according to their situation and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here, to the church in Laodicea, He refers to Himself as the Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Greek amen means firm, steadfast, or trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The Faithful and True Witness</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the Lord is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One, He is the faithful and true Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the degraded church in Laodicea is not firm, steadfast, trustworthy, or faithful and true as the Lord s witness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. The Beginning of the Creation of God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 14 the Lord also refers to Himself as the beginning of the creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This refers to the Lord as the origin or source of God s creation, implying that the Lord is the unchanging and ever-existing source of God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the degraded recovered church is changing by leaving the Lord as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CHURCH S CONDITION A. Neither Cold nor Hot Lukewarm</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verses 15 through 17 we see the condition of the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verses 15 and 16 the Lord says, I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once the recovered church becomes degraded, it is lukewarm neither cold nor hot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the actual condition of so many Brethren assemblies today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This should be a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once we become lukewarm, we are not fitting for the Lord s move and shall be vomited out of His mouth.</S>
