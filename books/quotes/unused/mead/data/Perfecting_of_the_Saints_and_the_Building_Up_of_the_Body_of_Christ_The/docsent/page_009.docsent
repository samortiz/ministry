   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT BEING DECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY GROWING INTO A FULL-GROWN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When these three winds blow among us, they produce three waves which cause difficulties among us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Anyone who is swept into these proves that he is childish in Christ and immature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he is a full-grown man and is no longer a babe, he will not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 4:14 tells us that these teachings are in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sleight of men in Greek signifies the cheating of dice players.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who say these things are all outwardly very good in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But within their speaking, there are different speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why it is a sleight of men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I speak to a couple, agreeing with them outwardly but causing them to divorce each other eventually, I am doing things in the sleight of men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Craftiness also refers to the tricks of the gamblers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who say these things lead people into the wiles of Satan and are used by Satan to bring people into his system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Try to imagine how the saints can be perfected if the apostles are to have nothing to do with a local church after they have appointed the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the local churches are deprived of the perfecting by the apostles, what will happen to them?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is like a university having no principal or professor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can education be conducted?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This reasoning is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, these kinds of sayings are a kind of craftiness, a system set up by Satan for the purpose of ensnaring in sin those who seek after the Lord and causing them to deviate from the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>HOLDING TO TRUTH IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 4:15 says, But holding to truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To hold to truth is in contrast to the sleight of men and the craftiness in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men and to be led into a system of error is to fail to hold to truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The truth here refers to things that are true.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first item of these is God s New Testament economy, which is God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has an eternal plan in the universe, which is His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second item is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third item is the church as the Body of Christ for expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These three things are the true things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should hold to these true things in love that we may grow up into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All teachings and speakings that separate and isolate us from these three things should be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we hold to truth in the love of God, we will grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows that our growth in life with Christ should be the growth of the members in the Body under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In everything big or small, such as the way we dress, the way we comb our hair, the way we shop, and the way we speak, we should take Christ as the Head, submitting under His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way, we will grow into Him and will allow Him to occupy all of our inward parts, that is, our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way, He will gradually increase and grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>OUT FROM HIM, ALL THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>CAUSES THE GROWTH OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we allow Him to be the Head in everything and when we grow up into Him in all things, we, being supplied with the riches of His life, will receive something from Him to transfuse into other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our growth in life is a growth into Him, but our function in the Body of Christ is out from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, we grow into the Head; then we have something out from the Head for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 4:16 says, Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every joint of the supply refers to the specially gifted persons, such as those mentioned previously.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Each one part refers to every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every joint of the supply is important to the Body of Christ; it has its special, rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Each one part also has its measure, through the growth in life and the development of the gifts, and operates for the growth of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the joints of the supply and the operation of each one part, all the members of the Body of Christ are fitted and knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fitting is the joining together of the frames into a structure; the knitting is the joining together of all the other parts to the frames to be knit together to become one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The result is a gradual growth of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BUILDING ITSELF UP IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The result is that the members of the Body of Christ directly build up the Body of Christ in the element and sphere of the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 23, 1988.</S>
