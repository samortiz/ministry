   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEARCHING LAMP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How will the gold in us take shape?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no question regarding our having the gold within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our question concerns transformation, not regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we be transformed into His image from glory to glory?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The answer lies with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church as the lampstand has seven lamps, which are God's seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>More than this, we are told in Proverbs 20:27, "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Within us, then, we have two lamps, the Spirit of God and our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Inside our little lamp is a stronger lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before we were saved, our spirit was a broken lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we repented, the lamp was restored and began to give forth light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day by day as we prayed, the shining increased.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With regeneration this lamp also had another lamp come into it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is because of these two lamps that there is so much shining within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two become one, for "he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man's spirit, Proverbs 20:27 goes on to say, searches all his inward parts, or, as Darby's footnote says, "all the chambers of the soul."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In your soul are various chambers, or rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spirit is searching the chamber of your emotions, and of your mind, and of your will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Though we all have the pure gold in us, the inward parts of our soul may not be open.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we pray, we are afraid to open our emotion, for example, to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we reach a certain point in our praying, we close up because we are unwilling to open some inner chamber to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may faithfully attend all the meetings, read the Word, and spend time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet there is a door within that is locked.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are aware of this, yet we tell the Lord that there is no way to open that door, even though we love Him and have paid a price in other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sisters' way of getting around such a problem is to shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because they have learned to win out by crying, they try this same tactic on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The brothers, on their part, react with stubbornness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"No, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I cannot open that part to You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You just have to forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever way we try, we cannot subdue the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will not force us, however.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will wait.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Meantime, in that chamber of our soul we are not being transformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>OPENING THE INNER CHAMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To have our spirit regenerated is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We confess our sins and receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we have the Spirit of God within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be transformed in our soul, however, is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It needs the lamp of the Lord to search all the inner chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are very few who have opened all their inner chambers to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may love the Lord, and you may pray regularly for your children and your grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet in your soul are two chambers that you reserve for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You keep the Lord locked out of there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many Christians are unaware that they have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They live in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without the spirit, however, the soul is dark.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It needs the lamp of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A lamp is for use in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because man has fallen, he is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus he is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because the spirit has lost its function, he has no light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He must repent, that is, turn his being to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before you heard the gospel, you did all kinds of evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You utterly neglected your spirit, and fully gave yourself to satisfy your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You lived according to your emotion, mind, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you heeded the call to repent, however, you turned and experienced the light shining in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You were saved and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now that you are saved, how are you living?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do you pay attention to your spirit or still live according to the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The only way to have light is to walk according to spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That light searches the inward parts of your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you are not in your spirit, you cannot see your true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You quarrel with others, certain that you are in the right and unaware that you are in darkness.</S>
