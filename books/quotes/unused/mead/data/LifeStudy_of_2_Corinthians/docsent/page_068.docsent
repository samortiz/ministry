   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OUR DAILY LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the matters of the Spirit and righteousness in the light of our experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When, as one who loves the Lord and seeks Him, you live Christ, do you not have the sense that within you there is something substantial, living, and active?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This living substance is not any kind of doctrine, teaching, or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, this living, active substance is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through the ministry today, we all have had the Spirit inscribed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many times after a meeting we realize that inside we have something living, substantial, and active.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This living substance is the Spirit in us, the Spirit who has been inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, the divine essence has been added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a certain person has never experienced this, I would doubt that he has truly been saved and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe all of us in the church life can testify that we have experienced the Spirit inwardly in a way that is living, active, and substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Along with this inward substance, we also have an outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This expression is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Anyone who has been inscribed with the Spirit of the living God will have an expression of righteousness in his daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, a married brother may experience the Spirit as the living substance within him through the inscribing that comes from the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spontaneously his wife will realize that something has happened to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She may say to herself, Something has happened to him, but I don t understand what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He seems to be right in every way and right with everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Formerly, he was wrong in the way he did many things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was wrong even in the way he put things away, for he never put them back in the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But now he takes care of everything in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I also see a difference in the way he speaks to me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When it is time for him to go to work, he tells me in such a nice way that he is leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He says, Dear, I m going to work now.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My husband is even right in the way he takes care of the dog.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I don t know what is going on with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the brother is experiencing the Spirit inwardly as the substance, he expresses righteousness in his life at home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we do not live Christ, we are wrong in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may be wrong in the way we close a window or a door.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of closing a door in a proper way, we may slam it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when we live Christ and experience something in us that is substantial and active, we become right in closing windows and doors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In fact, anything we do will be done in a right way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may be very careless in putting away their shoes or their clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you could see their bedroom, you would find that many things are out of order.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if those ones experience the Spirit as the substance within them, they will become right even with their shoes and clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everything will be put in the right place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you experience the Spirit inwardly and express righteousness outwardly, others will realize that something is different about you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the result of the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This ministry inscribes an essence into our being, an essence that has an inner aspect and an outer aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The inner aspect is the living Spirit moving in us; the outer aspect is righteousness as our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>EXPRESSING THE IMAGE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit and righteousness are both related to our expressing the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The reason for this is that the Spirit and righteousness are actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God as the Spirit is moving in you as a substance and living in you as an essence, for He Himself has been added into your being by the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, inwardly you have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The righteousness you express outwardly is also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, you are not only right in so many ways, and you are not only righteous, but you have God Himself as your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God as righteousness becomes your appearance, your expression.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, God Himself is the life-giving Spirit who lives, moves, and acts within you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then God Himself becomes the outward expression, the appearance, of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the essence of the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The work of the new covenant ministry is altogether different from that of most of today s preachers and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The work of the new covenant ministry is not merely to teach us to improve our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, this ministry inscribes us with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To inscribe is to add more of the essence of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Inwardly this essence is the Spirit; outwardly it is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But as we have seen, both the Spirit inwardly and the righteousness outwardly are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the ministry of the new covenant, a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, is simply a ministry of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To say that the ministry of the new covenant is of the Spirit and of righteousness is equal to saying that the new covenant ministry is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, to say that this ministry is of God is to speak in a general way, whereas to say that it is of the Spirit and of righteousness is to speak in a more particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Praise the Lord that the Spirit is God within us living, moving, and acting, and righteousness is God expressed to become our appearance outwardly!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The central vision of the Bible is related to the image of God expressed by the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Regarding this, the first two chapters of Genesis are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Genesis 1 we have the image of God: And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness....So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s intention is that we express Him with His image.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, if we would express God in this way, we need to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The life of God is signified by the tree of life in Genesis 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The life within is the Spirit, and the image outwardly for expression is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise the Lord for the new covenant ministry with the two aspects of life and expression!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Inwardly we have the Spirit as life, and outwardly we have righteousness as our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Among all the people on earth, the most righteous persons are those who live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever you live Christ, you will be right in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will not need anyone to teach you to be right, for the Christ who lives within you will make you right in everything and right with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we are careless with our things or in the way we close a door, this is an indication that we are not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we truly live Christ, we shall close a door in a right way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We shall also be proper when we knock on someone s door or ring the doorbell.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once again I say that it is not necessary for someone to teach us how to close a door, how to knock on a door, or how to ring a doorbell.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Bible does not contain such instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If the Bible contained a rule for every aspect of our daily living, it would be too big for any of us to carry.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is the Spirit within us who makes us righteous in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What we need is more inscribing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we are inscribed with the Spirit, the divine essence is imparted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This essence causes the process of spiritual metabolism to take place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>As a result of this process, we are transformed into the Lord s image.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>INWARD TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>AND OUTWARD RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have seen that to be transformed into the Lord s image from glory to glory is to be transformed from the Spirit to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we experience such an inward transformation, spontaneously we shall have righteousness as our outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then we shall be right with God, with others, and with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>However, many people are not right with God, with others, or with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Daily they offend God and those around them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Furthermore, because they are short of the divine essence, they are not right with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Therefore, they need the ministry which inscribes the divine essence into them.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Inwardly, this essence will be the Spirit in them, and outwardly it will be expressed as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This understanding of 2 Corinthians 3, especially of verse 18, is not merely according to doctrine; it is according to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>For years I have been seeking to understand 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Now from my experience with the Lord I realize that the Spirit is the essence of God living, moving, and acting within me, and righteousness is the essence of God manifested outwardly as God s image to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As a result of having the Spirit inwardly and righteousness as the image of God outwardly, I become right with God, with man, with myself, and with so many aspects of my daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Because we are right in every way, we have peace, joy, rest, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is the issue, the result, of the ministry of the new covenant.</S>
