   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOLY ASPIRATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nothing is more satisfying than the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the Old Testament saints the thought of coming into the courts of the Lord's house stirred holy and godly aspirations within them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of the psalms illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These psalms are filled with aspirations of holiness, godliness, piety, and the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In fact, even the thought of the house of God aroused such aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE PRESENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The presence of God is very much related to the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before I came into the church life, I truly loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, I did not have much enjoyment of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when I came into the church life in a practical way, I began to enjoy the Lord's presence day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even during the course of a very demanding job, I had the enjoyment of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to my experience, I can testify that participating in the church life makes a tremendous difference in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us can give a similar testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we came to the church, we were in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We loved the Lord and we sought the Lord, but we did not have much enjoyment of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, after we came into the church life, various holy desires and aspirations were aroused within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>More than ever before, we aspired to be in the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the spontaneous result of returning to the ground of oneness, to the unique place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God's people returned to Jerusalem, all the positive things that had been lost during their captivity in Babylon were restored.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the sacred, godly, heavenly things spontaneously returned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has been the same with us in the Lord's recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>FILLED WITH REJOICING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Psalm 126:1 says, "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's returned people were filled with laughter and rejoicing because all the positive things had been restored.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before they returned to Jerusalem, however, they did not have such an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after they returned, they enjoyed so many excellent things that it seemed to them like a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isaiah 35:10 and 51:11, verses that are very similar, also speak of the joy of God's returned people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses declare that "the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fact that this matter is repeated shows its importance, for anything in the Bible that is repeated is of special significance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During Isaiah's time, the Babylonian captivity had not yet occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, Isaiah spoke about the gladness, the enjoyment, of God's salvation of His ransomed people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He foresaw the joy of the returned captives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not believe that Solomon and his contemporaries were as joyful as Zerubbabel, Joshua the priest, Ezra, and all the others who had returned to Jerusalem from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They experienced much more of the joy of God's salvation than Solomon did.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, the writer of Psalm 126 declared that they were like them who dream.</S>
