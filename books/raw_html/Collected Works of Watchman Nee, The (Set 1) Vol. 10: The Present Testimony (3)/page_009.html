<P>God will not do any work on us. If He removes the root of our sin, we will have no need to believe. God has accomplished everything in Christ. He wants us to look to Him day by day and believe His Word which says that we are a new creation in Christ. God does not lie. Whatever God speaks will be done. If we believe, it will be ours. This is the secret of overcoming.</P><P>Ephesians 1:6 says, "...His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved." God accepts us only in the Beloved. No one can please God outside of Christ. God can keep us and accept us only in Christ.</P><P>Colossians 1:14 says, "In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins." Being saved and being forgiven are both in Christ. Have you asked God to forgive you? Suppose a Christian has committed a sin and asks God to forgive him. Do you know when God forgives him? Some say the evidence that you have been forgiven comes only after you have prayed to the point of having peace in your heart. But are there not many people who still have peace in their hearts even after committing sins? Are there not many people who still have no peace even though their sins have been forgiven? Your feeling is not dependable. If a Christian has sinned, can you tell him how long he has to pray before he can obtain forgiveness? You should know that your sins were borne by Christ more than nineteen hundred years ago. You died in the death of Christ; you are forgiven. All you have to do is to bow down and take what Christ has accomplished. If you expect God to do a new thing on you, it is impossible to say how long you would have to pray. When you ask God to forgive you, you are really asking for the forgiveness in Christ to flow to you. Your forgiveness depends upon your faith that God has forgiven you in Christ. It does not depend on feeling.</P><P>Second Corinthians 5:21 says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." We are justified because we are in Christ. God does not justify us because we do good. God justifies us in Christ. If we want to wait until we regard ourselves as righteous before we believe, we will never believe.</P><P>First Corinthians 1:2 says, "To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place." We are justified because we are in Christ; we are sanctified also because we are in Christ. Many people make a big mistake by saying that God has given them holiness and that they were sanctified on a certain day of a certain month. If we expect God to work on us until we are sanctified, this will never happen. All we need to do is to receive what is in Christ</P><P>The light in a car is supplied by only a little amount of electricity that is stored in the battery. If we are in Christ, we will be like the light in a room; although the source of the electrical power is not in the room, electricity flows into the room. Once the connection is made and the switch is turned on, the light will come. But when the connection is broken or the switch is turned off, the light will not come. When we are joined to Christ, we have everything; once we are disconnected, we find ourselves to be just like unbelievers. A single work is never accomplished on us; everything is accomplished in Christ. We are merely a wire through which electricity flows.</P><P>Romans 8:38 and 39 say, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." All these things cannot separate us from the love of God. There is only one reason: this love is in Christ Jesus.</P><P>Colossians 2:10 says, "And you have been made full in Him...." We have been made full because we are in Christ, not because of ourselves.</P><P>Colossians 3:3 says, "And your life is hidden with Christ in God." Our lives are hidden with Christ in God.</P><P>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." We are freed because we are in Christ, not because of ourselves. Those who believe this are blessed. But those who beg for it will not receive.</P><P>Ephesians 1:3 says, "Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." This verse surely has much for us to enjoy. No matter what the spiritual blessings are, they are altogether in Christ. If you have this verse, you can say, "I thank and praise God because He has given me every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." The extent of your belief in God's Word is the extent of your receiving of the reality.</P><P>John 16:33 says, "In Me you may have peace." Peace is not found outside of the Lord. When we are in the Lord, we have His peace.</P><P>Philippians 2:1 says, "If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions."</P><P>Second Corinthians 12:2 says, "I know a man in Christ." This speaks of a person who is in Christ; his whole being is in Christ.</P><P>If you carefully read the Bible, you will not ask God to do a work on you. If you want God to do a work on you, you will not only be disappointed today and tomorrow; you will be disappointed until the day you die. If the electrical switch is turned off, you cannot expect the lamp to have light. The moment the switch is turned on, immediately there is light. If you do not believe in Christ moment by moment, you will not be victorious. You need the Lord every moment. In Christ you have everything.</P>
