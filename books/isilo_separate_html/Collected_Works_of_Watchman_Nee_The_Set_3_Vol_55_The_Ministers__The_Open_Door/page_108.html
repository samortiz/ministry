Although last year's calendar had many defects because of difficulties in the circumstances, we hope to do our best to improve and correct this year's efforts. We will do our best to make the price, wrapper, paper, shipping, and other matters up to our standard. This year we are asking the co-workers here, in other parts of China, and from overseas to supply us with the contents. We believe this will meet the needs of the brothers and sisters.</p><p>In addition to a daily calendar for the believers, we hope to print another yearly calendar.</p><p>The price for the Believers' Daily Calendar will be half a unit of the Foochow currency, including shipping. (According to the exchange rate at the time of printing, half a unit equals 3,000 yen.) We have calculated the price of the yearly calendar in yen. Each calendar will cost 300 yen including shipping. One is expensive, and the other is cheap. If the brothers and sisters in your locality want to order calendars, please send us a letter with your order by the end of October so that we will know how many have been pre-ordered. If you wire money through the post office, please mark it with the name of our branch office: "Nan Street Post Office." If the brothers and sisters around your area want to pre-order, please pass on this information to them also.</p><p>The Foochow Gospel Book Store<br />October 2, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: Hsin 58 Jin-Men Road, Foochow</p><h2 class="head1">THE OPEN DOOR</h2><h2 class="head2">(The Ministers is now combined into this paper)</h2><p>NATURE: To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities go on, and to solve problems related to the ministry.</p><p>FREQUENCY: We publish irregularly.</p><p>PRICES: We have no set price.</p><p>SUBSCRIPTION: All who wish to subscribe to this publication should clearly write their name, address, and number of copies and send it to Distribution Department, The Gospel Book Room, P.
