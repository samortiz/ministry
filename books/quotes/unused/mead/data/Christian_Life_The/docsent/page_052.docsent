   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:18 says that Christ is the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His glory in eternity past, He was the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since He was the Son of God, why did He need to be begotten of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was because God needed a firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ was the Son of God in eternity past, but He became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His flesh was human, not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This human part was surely not related to the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His human part had to be begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this purpose, I invented a new word "sonized."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's humanity had to be sonized in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His resurrection, He brought His humanity into divinity, making this humanity something divine.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His resurrection, we all were begotten by God to be His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The firstborn Son of God and the many millions of sons of God were begotten at the same time in one "delivery."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I once read of a woman who had seven children in one delivery, but the delivery of Christ's resurrection delivered a countless number of sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to remember that the resurrection of Christ produced three big matters: the life-giving Spirit, the firstborn Son of God, and the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life-giving Spirit, the firstborn Son, and the many sons of God are altogether for the Body of Christ, which is the organism of the Divine Trinity.</S>
