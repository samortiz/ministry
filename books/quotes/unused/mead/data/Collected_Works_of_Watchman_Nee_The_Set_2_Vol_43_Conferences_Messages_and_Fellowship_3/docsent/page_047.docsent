   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: August 10, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Phil 1:21a; Gal 2:20; Col 3:4; 1 Cor 1:30 MANY CHRISTIANS SEEKING VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>WITHOUT OVERCOMING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yesterday we saw that God's goal is to give us Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we want to see why God gives us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said, "Christ our life," and, "For to me, to live is Christ" Col 3:4; Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we have to admit that the way we live does not reflect the fact that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We fail, we are weak, and we glorify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are short of love, and we make demands on others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not love the brothers, and we are not like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We find it hard to speak like the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our thoughts are filthy and unholy, and we are defeated by many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ has died for us and risen to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in our daily life we do not have the experience of Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we have the life of Christ, we do not live it out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not very different from the worldly people, and we have not grown very much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we look at ourselves, all of our sins are still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not know how Christ can be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some seek to control their temper, hoping that they can become patient, and some seek for victory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in spite of their pursuits, their prayer before the Lord, their confession, their prayer for grace, and their aspirations for a holy life of humility, gentleness, and brotherly love, their stubbornness remains and their nature is unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although they pray much, it seems as if God has never heard their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do not know what they should do before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we want to consider what it means for Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE NEED TO BE HUNGRY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN ONE'S PURSUIT FOR VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have mentioned previously that a dissatisfied person will not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only a hungry person will receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Friends, do not confuse dissatisfaction with hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people are not satisfied with their daily life, but they do not have a positive desire to pursue before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have not had any dealings with the Lord and have never wrestled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, a dissatisfied person is not necessarily a hungry person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me say a strong word: Although you may be dissatisfied, you may not be experiencing the overcoming life at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only a hungry person can receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who are not hungry may understand what I am saying, but they will still not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have never seen a person who is not hungry overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person may understand the doctrine of victory, but just being dissatisfied will not make one victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only seeking ones will experience Christ as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who think that they can pick up the overcoming life capriciously are cherishing a vain hope.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You can pick up any item off the street, but victory is not something that can be picked up mindlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Victory does not come by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only the hungry and seeking ones find it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If only three or five persons attending this conference find it, I will be very thankful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>CHRIST OVERCOMING FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The overcoming life is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has given us Christ so that we will not only live by Him but that He would also become our life and live within us on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has given us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His intention is not just for Him to live within us but for Him to live for us within.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has already died for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today He wants to live for us within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not a matter of overcoming through trusting in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nor is it a matter of Christ empowering us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not even a matter of Him helping us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a matter of us stepping aside and Christ becoming our victory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let me repeat: This is not a matter of Christ empowering us to overcome, nor is it a matter of Christ upholding us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, it is Christ overcoming on our behalf, just as He died on the cross on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ died on the cross for us; we did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is living for us in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not have to put forth any effort of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For God to give us Christ as our life means that He has put Christ within us and has caused Him to live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our old man has died, and Christ is living for us within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is fully a matter of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it is not a substitution, it is not the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without the cross, there is no victory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today we are not asking the Lord to empower us to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, the Lord within us is becoming our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We may be stubborn, proud, critical of others, lacking in love, or filled with unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not ask the Lord to empower us to overcome these things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, the Lord within us is becoming our purity, meekness, and humility for us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything is in the principle of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not see the matter of substitution, there will never be any victory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A man can be conscious of his mistakes before God, but this does not mean that he will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may ask God to help us overcome, but we will never overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God does not help men overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He knows that we will only fail.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He crucified our old man on the cross and gave Christ to us to be our true bread so that He would live for us within.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the gospel, this is God's way of salvation, and this is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christ is our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many people think that Christ helps them overcome or that Christ empowers them to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But this is not the way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are so weak that we cannot even stand up by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Overcoming is altogether a matter of Christ living for us within us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is God's way of salvation.</S>
