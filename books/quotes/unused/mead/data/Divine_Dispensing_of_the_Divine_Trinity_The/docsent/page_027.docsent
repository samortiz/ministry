   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT GOD S DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE MINISTRY OF PAUL 2 Scripture Reading: Heb 2:10-12; Rom 8:29; 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12, 13, 27; Col 1:18; Eph 4:4; 1:23; 1 Tim 3:15; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Cor 3:16-17; Eph 2:21-22; 2:15; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11; Eph 3:19; 1:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, how we worship You as the speaking and dispensing God!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank You that You have been speaking so much to us to dispense Yourself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank You that in these days we are under Your dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even in this message we are listening to Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We would like to receive Your dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord Jesus! make these days full of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dispense Yourself into us during these days that all of us will be filled up with Your dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank You, Lord, for Your cleansing blood which opens up the way for You to come in to dispense and saturate us with Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank You for Your speaking in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have no trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the foregoing message we saw that whatever Christ is, is for the one purpose of dispensing God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the focus of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it has not been seen by many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christianity has made nearly everything religious, instead of making everything divine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all have to rise up against anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should be altogether for something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be regenerated is not something religious; it is something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regeneration is not to have a religious life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is to have a divine life in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a divine life with a divine birth makes us a divine child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the initial stage of God s dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God first dispenses Himself into us by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is our second birth, our spiritual and even divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Birth is just a beginning of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without birth there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah! we have had the beginning of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This beginning is just the divine birth, regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many Christians seem to have forgotten about their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although they are born again and had such a wonderful divine beginning, after their regeneration they were led astray from the divine things to the religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After their regeneration, they made nearly everything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, they talk about love and holiness apart from the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They talk about being a good husband or a good wife apart from the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They talk about being good children or good parents apart from the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even they talk about being a good Christian apart from the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Epistles of the New Testament, especially those of Paul, the phrase, in Christ , or, in the Lord occurs frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a short and brief, but a very crucial phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, in Ephesians 6:1 Paul said, The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians, however, in their understanding cut off this phrase, in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This crucial phrase means a lot!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are not in the Lord, there is no Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Honoring the parents, loving the wife, or submitting to the husband must be in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If these things are not in the Lord, that is not the Christian life, but an ethical life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ethics teaches good morality, behavior, and character but altogether outside of Christ and apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we Christians are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not apart from Christ; we are part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are in an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the vine, and we are the branches John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The branches of the vine are not simply joined to the vine; they are organically united to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The branches and the vine have a common life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The branches could not have their being without the vine.</S>
