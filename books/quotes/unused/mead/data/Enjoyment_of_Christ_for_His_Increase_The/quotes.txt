[1]  CHAPTER ONE CHRIST AS LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-27; 2:8-9; Col 1:15; 3:4; 1 John 5:12; John 1:4; 6:35, 57, 63; 2 Cor 4:7; Gal 4:19; Rom 8:29 GOD S INTENTION TO PUT CHRIST
[2]  At the beginning of the Scriptures, two matters are mentioned in relation to man the image of God and the life of God.
[3]  God s eternal intention, His divine purpose, was to create man according to Christ, as a picture of Christ, so that man would take Christ as his life.
[4]  According to the revelation in the Scriptures, we were made according to the image of Christ to be photos of Christ, and the one thing we must do is to receive Christ as our life.
[5]  OUR NEED TO CONTACT THE LORD AND RECEIVE HIM
[6]  In order to eat the Lord, we have to open our mouth.
[7]  Many of us in our morning time offer a prayer to the Lord asking Him to help us to do this and to do that.
[8]  However, if the Lord opens our eyes, we will realize that when we go to the Lord early in the morning each day, we should not go to Him to ask Him to help us to do many things.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST AS THE BREAD OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14, 12; 6:35, 56-57, 63; 10:10; 12:24; 14:16-20; 15:4-5
[10]  If we look carefully into these two ends of the Scriptures, we will realize that both of them are related to the matter of God being life to man.
[11]  Although man was created according to the image of God, which is Christ Col 1:15; 2 Cor 4:4 , man did not have the life of God.
[12]  When we go to the Lord, we need to praise Him and thank Him that He is in us as our life, our food, our drink, our strength, and our everything.
[13]  In order to put this matter into practice, we need to know the secret of maintaining our abiding in Him and His abiding in us.
[14]  First of all, we need to have the revelation that we are in Christ.
[15]  I would even suggest that we place these two words in Christ in a frame and hang it on our wall.
[16]  We are now in Christ, but do we have the full realization that we are in Him?
[17]  If we have the intention to abide in Christ, the first thing we need to see is that we are already in Him.
[18]  Then, whenever we discover a problem between us and Christ, we should go to Him right away and open to Him, telling Him, Lord, there is a problem.
[19]  CHAPTER THREE TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading: Rom 8:29; Gal 4:19; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:2; 1 Cor 2:16b; Eph 4:22-24; Rom 8:6
[20]  In the last two messages we saw that God s eternal purpose is to impart Himself into us as life in Christ through the Holy Spirit.
[21]  The Scriptures tell us that we Christians are predestinated by God to be conformed to the image of His Son, Christ Rom 8:29 .
[22]  When we receive Christ as our Savior, we have Him as our very life; the Spirit brings Christ into our spirit to be life to us and regenerate us.
[23]  Although we possess a natural life by our first birth, we receive another life, the divine life, by receiving Christ as Lord and Savior.
[24]  God is within us as our life; the very Triune God in Christ as the Spirit is indwelling our spirit v. 11 . Now we and God are one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 . This is a wonderful, divine mystery.
[25]  We have the life of Christ, but we are not like Christ in the way we think, in the way we love things, in the manner in which we choose things, and in the way we conduct ourselves.
[26]  The practical way for us to be transformed is by being renewed in our mind Rom 12:2 .
[27]  By listening to what Christians talk about when they come together, we can often tell that, whether American or Chinese, they do not bear the form of Christ.
[28]  In our spirit we are brothers in Christ, but in our mind we remain American or Chinese.
[29]  We can all say that we have the life of Christ, but can we all say that we have the mind of Christ?
[30]  Then we will not only have the life of Christ and the mind of Christ, but even more we will have the form of Christ.
[31]  We will have the life of Christ, the mind of Christ, the heart of Christ, the emotions of Christ, the will of Christ, and even the image of Christ.
[32]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CHURCH AS THE INCREASE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 3:28-30; 12:24; 17:21-23
[33]  John 3:28-30 says, You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him.
[34]  The way for the many grains to become one Body, one bread, is found in John 17, where the Lord prayed that all the believers would be one.
[35]  Verses 21 through 23 say, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.
[36]  Since you have the life of Christ, I have the life of Christ, and others have the life of Christ, we are all one in this same life.
[37]  John 3:29-30 tells us that the Lord must have a bride as His increase, His Body, the church.
[38]  Christ s increase comes into being because Christ died, rose, and imparted His life into us to make us His counterpart.
[39]  Christ is the unique grain of wheat, and we are now the many grains as His increase.
[40]  We can have this oneness only by taking Christ as our life and allowing Christ to live in us.
[41]  We are in Christ, Christ is in us, and we have Christ as our life; therefore, we are one.
