   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Refusal to Let Go Resulting in Religion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the one hand, we cannot say that during all these years our spiritual stature has remained stunted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be honest, however, our growth has been very slow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A situation has developed among us that has limited and restricted our spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is a seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we provide opportunity for it to fall into the earth, if we till the earth so that the seed can go deep into the soil, and if we allow water, air, and sunlight to work on it, it will surely grow and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the past ten years, our tree has been standing here, but year after year there is no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no branching out, no harvesting, and no multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only reason for this failure is that we have bound ourselves up as with a chain, and this binding factor is our religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, it is our method of working that has bound us up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Allow me to tell you why I appointed fifty-two elders in one night when I returned in October two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since 1979, every time Brother Chang Wu-chen came to the United States, I asked him to appoint a few elders in the church in Taipei to help in the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1975 when I returned to Taipei, I made a change, because at that time the elders were too old, and there were signs of deterioration in the leadership of the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was the need to add a few brothers to the eldership, but it was impossible to raise up so many elders in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I therefore asked the three Brother Changs to temporarily take the lead, with the hope that more brothers would shortly become qualified to become elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, by 1979 no elders had been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I fellowshipped with Brother Chang Wu-chen to see if some suitable brothers could be appointed, but there was still no nomination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I had no choice but to wait longer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The next year, in 1980, we considered the matter again, and the result was the same; no one was considered qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We waited in this way for six years, but there were still only a few who were considered qualified to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please give me the liberty to speak an honest word here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By October of the year before last, when I returned to Taipei, there were only three to five elders besides the few senior co-workers here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even with these, a healthy eldership was not established.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though there were a few elders, the work and administration of the church were still in the hands of a few co-workers, and there was no true administration by the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1949 when I first began the work in Taipei, I spoke sternly that all the matters related to the church, whether great or small, must be brought to the elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders meeting at that time was on Saturday afternoons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times we would meet until eight or nine o clock, eating a sack dinner along the way and continuing to meet after we ate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But gradually, these meetings became co-workers meetings, and a few co-workers made all the decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even when some elders were present, they were only tag-alongs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I returned two years ago, I looked at the list of names of all the responsible ones in all the meeting halls and discussed them one by one with all the elders and with Brother Chang Wu-chen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Generally speaking, all the responsible brothers of all the twenty-one halls were quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They all loved the Lord, they were all for the Lord, and they were all consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I told the brothers, Since they all love the Lord and are given to the Lord, and since all the meeting halls are in their hands already, they can all be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brothers did not disagree.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, they felt quite good about this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, we did away with our past cautious conservatism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On that night we appointed fifty-two elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We thank the Lord for this big change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We overturned the control.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We no longer tried to manipulate with human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, we allowed the Lord to lead and control these saints from within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After half a year, we appointed another twenty-eight elders.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Altogether we appointed eighty elders, and later we added a few more.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I did this to show that the church should not be under any individual s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only the Holy Spirit has the absolute right over the church, and only the Head is qualified to exercise control over the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Absolutely Delivered from Any Kind of Control</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please give me the liberty to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since we have changed the system, everything that we do, all the arrangements that we make, and all the methods that we use are an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are doing everything in an exploratory way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even until today we are still in the experimental stage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have a concern for the eighty elders, which is the same concern that I had for the co-workers before them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am concerned that subconsciously we are exercising control again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The thought of control is in our very blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Consider the situation in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If three children are playing together, no one needs to teach them about control.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The oldest one will spontaneously boss the two smaller ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will spontaneously try to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The thought of control is in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past we were only responsible brothers in the various halls, but now we are the elders, and we may feel that we have been promoted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We feel great, and our family feels flattered.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am fully aware of such sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if we adopt this kind of attitude, and if we say in our heart, My, I am an elder now! we can be sure that the brothers and sisters will be killed by our control.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My sixty years of experience as a Christian and living in the church has confirmed to me the reality of such a concern.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this reason, I charge again and again not to exercise any control.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should take our hands off, allowing the brothers and sisters to do things by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>With some of us, our practice in the past was to allow the saints to meet in the homes only after we granted them permission.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Until the elders had an interview with a candidate, he could not be baptized, and even when he was baptized, he was baptized by the ones who were approved by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some may say, Brother Lee, this is what you taught us to do thirty-five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since I was the one who tied the knot, of course, I need to be the one to untie it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That might have been the right thing to do thirty-five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At that time the light we received was not strong enough, and we saw only so much.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today, however, I have awakened from my dream.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I see that something is wrong, and I am sounding the call to change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whoever does not agree with me and still wants to exercise control must be responsible for the tangled knot.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although we cannot claim full success for the new way, we can already perceive some results.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today we can meet in the homes at any time and anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no need to be under any control.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is no more need for a formal interview to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As long as a new one is willing, those who preach the gospel to him can baptize him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is no need to visit the baptistery in the meeting hall very often; all the saints have bathtubs and water in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They can baptize the new ones in their homes immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>During a recent gospel meeting, about fifty to sixty saints were baptized in the bathroom of the apartments above the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Both the arrangements of the baptism and the interviews were carried out in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The saints took care of them organically.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When I saw this, I was very happy, and I was happier when I attended the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>People were ready for baptism right there on the spot, and the saints quickly filled up the bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Two small soldiers of no special rank baptized them in the bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This kind of organic practice is the best and most accurate way revealed by the Scriptures.</S>
