   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Caring for God s Desire</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The ascended Christ cares not only for us and our welfare: He cares for God s desires.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This High Priest cares more for God s need than for our need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God wants lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the Lord establishes lampstands and trims the lamps for the expression of God Rev 1:13; 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This work includes His edifying of the saints and His building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord is now building up a living testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Executor of the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the High Priest in the heavens, the Lord is the surety and Mediator of the better covenant and the Executor of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 7:22 says, Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That Christ has become the surety of a better covenant is based on the fact that He is the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hebrews 8:6 tells us, He is also the Mediator of a better covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, Hebrews 9:15 and 16 say, And because of this He is Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For where there is a testament there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 15 we have the word covenant, and in verse 16, the word testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A covenant is an agreement with some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will with certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First God gave the promise that He would make a new covenant Jer 31:31-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then Christ shed His blood to enact the covenant Luke 22:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since there are accomplished facts promised in this covenant, it is also a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This testament, this will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ s death, and it is now being executed by Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our High Priest is establishing lampstands and trimming the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this establishing and trimming, He is also executing the New Testament for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Testament has many bequests, all of which are divine blessings bequeathed to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Bible the word testament is equal to the modern word will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament, therefore, is a new will for our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This new will is for the bequeathing of the divine blessings, including the Person of Christ and His all-inclusive redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The One who enacted this new will is Jesus Christ, who died for its enactment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now whatever He enacted has been bequeathed to us and is available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The enactment of a will and all that is bequeathed in it requires the death of the one who makes the will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once the maker of the will dies, the bequests in the will become available to the heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord that Christ died to enact the will and that He is now in the heavens as the living Executor of the will He has bequeathed to us!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How does He execute this will?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He executes the new will by establishing the churches as the lampstands and by trimming all the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At this very moment the ascended Christ is establishing lampstands and trimming the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can testify that daily I am under His trimming, for I have much that needs to be trimmed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I also realize that He is walking among the local churches, that He is establishing the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By doing this He is executing, carrying out, the New Testament in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every blessing in the New Testament is a bequest applied to us by the living, resurrected, and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise Him that we may enjoy Him in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ s ministry as the High Priest in the heavens has a destination the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Jerusalem will be the consummation of Christ s work in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever Christ is now working in His ascension will consummate in the coming New Jerusalem.</S>
