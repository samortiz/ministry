   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORETELLING THE DANGER OF THE VOYAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider some of the details recorded in 27:1-44.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 27:1 says, And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan cohort.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The pronoun we indicates that Luke, the writer, was included.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Augustan cohort may have been an imperial cohort named by Caesar Augustus cf.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Luke 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A cohort was one of ten divisions of an ancient Roman legion and was composed of six hundred men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 2 continues, And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, and Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the beginning of the apostle s fourth ministry journey, which ended in 28:31.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his account Luke says that at Myra the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it v. 6 . Verses 9 and 10 say, And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, and also because the Fast had already passed, Paul advised them, saying, Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with damage and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Fast in verse 9 refers to the day of atonement Lev 16:29-31; 23:27-29; Num 29:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 10 Paul voiced his feeling about the danger of the voyage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sailors were experts in sailing the ship, and they knew all about the wind and the sea, but they did not have the insight that Paul had.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Paul warned them of the damage and loss they would face, the centurion was persuaded by the navigator and the ship s owner rather than by what was being said by Paul v. 11 . The navigator and the ship s owner convinced the centurion not to take Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, according to their mistaken concept, they continued the voyage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul, of course, was neither a sailor nor a navigator.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, he was a preacher who at that time was a prisoner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, he had more insight than the centurion, the soldiers, the sailors, the navigator, and the owner of the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we have a view of Paul s character.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE STORM AND PAUL S PREDICTION OF SAFETY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 27:13-26 describes the storm and Paul s prediction of safety.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 13 and 14 say, And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete close inshore.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But not long afterward there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called a northeaster.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Literally, the Greek word translated the island means it and refers to Crete.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 15 through 17 continue: And when the ship was caught by it and was not able to face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And running under the shelter of a certain little island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get control of the small boat, which having hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on Syrtis, they lowered the gear and so were driven along.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To get control of the small boat was to secure on deck the small boat which, in calm weather, was attached by a rope to the vessel s stern Vincent .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The helps mentioned in verse 17 were things such as ropes and chains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To undergird the ship with these helps was to pass the cables around the body of the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Syrtis, on which they feared that they might run aground, was a shoal southwest of the island of Crete.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the sailors to lower the gear means either that they lowered the sails or dropped the sea anchor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to verses 18 and 19, they began to jettison the cargo and throw the ship s gear, or furniture, overboard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 20 indicates that the storm was so severe that eventually they lost hope: Now, when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us, all hope that we might be saved was now abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we shall now see, that time was a good opportunity for Paul to say something to those on the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning this, verse 21 says, And when they had gone a long time without food, Paul then stood in their midst and said, O men, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although Paul was a prisoner in bonds, his behavior displayed much ascendancy with dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Luke s narration, as an account of the Lord s move on earth, does not stress doctrine but the testimony of the Lord s witnesses 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, in his narration there are no details of doctrines but of the events that occurred to His witnesses, in order to portray their testimonies in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is especially so with Paul s voyage in the last two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here Paul was a witness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we should not read Luke s account merely as a story of a storm at sea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, we need to see in this story the description of the life of one of Christ s living witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 27:21 Paul was frank.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The others on board the ship did not have a word to say.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone, including the centurion and the navigator, was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In verse 22 Paul went on to say, And now I advise you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They all had lost heart and were waiting for death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul, however, told them to cheer up, assuring them there would be no loss of life but only of the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here Paul seems to be saying, There will be no loss of life among us, but the ship will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because you did not listen to me, you will lose your ship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verses 23 and 24 continue, For this very night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me, saying, Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 23 Paul indicated first that he belonged to God and then that he served Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Greek word rendered serve means to serve as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 24 the angel assured Paul that he would stand before Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was to fulfill the Lord s promise in 23:11 and the apostle s desire in 19:21.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to verse 24, God granted to Paul all those who were sailing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This indicates that God had given them to Paul and that they were all under him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Apart from Paul s presence with them, they all would have lost their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here Paul seems to be saying, Because of me, your lives will be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord has given all of you to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In verses 25 and 26 Paul went on to say, Wherefore, cheer up, men, for I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we must run aground on a certain island.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may regard this word both as an insight and as a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul had the wisdom to see into the situation and to realize what would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because he spoke such a definite word about running aground on a certain island, we may consider this word a prophecy.</S>
