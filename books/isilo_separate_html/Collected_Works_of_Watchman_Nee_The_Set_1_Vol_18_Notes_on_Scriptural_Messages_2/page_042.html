The title of this story is "A Defeated Righteous Man." This title means that the person is defeated, but he is also a righteous man. There are victorious righteous people, and there are defeated righteous people. We must use this defeated righteous man as a warning in order to be victorious righteous persons. Who is this defeated righteous one? Let us read 2 Peter 2:6-8 in the Bible.</P><P>"And having reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemned them to ruin, having set them as an example to those who intend to live an ungodly life, and rescued righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless (for that righteous man, who settled down among them, in seeing and hearing tormented his righteous soul day after day with their lawless works)." Lot was such a person. His soul was a righteous soul, and he was a righteous man. His soul was tormented day after day upon seeing and hearing unlawful works. Since he was such a man, why do we say that he was a defeated righteous man?</P><P>We have to know who Lot was. Lot was neither a famous person nor an uncommon man. Lot is well-known because he had a famous uncle, Abraham. His uncle was a renowned man. He became well-known because of his uncle. Let us read in the book of Genesis to see what kind of person Lot was.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING OF LOT</H2><P>Genesis 11:31 says, "And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there." If we read Acts 7, we know that when Abraham was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, God appeared to him and called him out of his country and his kindred to go into a land which God would show him. He left the land of the Chaldeans for Canaan. He was not the only one who left Ur of the Chaldees; his father followed him. And Abraham's father was not the only one who left with him; his nephew Lot also followed him. Lot was just like a "preacher's boy" or part of a believer's family. Lot followed his uncle when he left Ur for Canaan because his uncle said that Ur of the Chaldees was a place of confusing morality that had been condemned by God and that they had to go to Canaan because God had called them to leave Ur.</P><P>According to the historians, Abraham's house was a house of idol-makers. This, most likely, was the profession of Abraham's father. Joshua 24 mentions that Abraham was brought out of the house of idol-worshippers. Since Lot heard his uncle say that he wanted to leave the world behind and no longer live carelessly, he followed his uncle and departed from Ur.</P><P>Our friends here today may not have personally heard God's call. Perhaps your grandfather, father, mother, wife, or uncle have heard God's call and brought you along. Lot himself did not hear God's call. Only his uncle heard it. This is why he left with his uncle. Perhaps your father, brother, sister, or wife believed first, but eventually you also believed. You are a Lot. If there is someone in your house who has believed in the Lord, and if you are not willing to follow, you are wrong. It is best to follow. It is excellent when some people follow their mother or father in believing, but unfortunately, many people themselves do not know God. Your grandfather believes, your uncle believes, but you do not know God. This is a pity.</P><P>Lot was good. Not only did he follow his uncle, but he was also a righteous person. Abraham was like an older believer. Lot was like a young believer. Since Lot and Abraham were relatives and had taken the same path, it should have been excellent. The beginning of these two men was excellent, but eventually they separated. How were they separated? Let us look at the ensuing passage in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LOT'S CHOICE</H2><P>Genesis 13:5-6 says, "And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together." It is easy to bear suffering and distress together. It is more difficult to be in comfort together. The two men left Ur together and went to Canaan. This was very good, and God blessed them. Their possessions multiplied. However, problems arise as soon as possessions multiply. If I have a place to live, you will not have the same place to live. If you have a place to live, I will not be able to have the same place. If your flocks and herds have grass to feed on, mine will have none. If my flocks and herds have grass, yours will have none. You may not say anything, and I may not say anything, but the servants will speak even if the masters do not.</P><P>Genesis 13:7 says, "And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle." There was a strife among their subordinates. One said, "My cattle must graze on the pasture here." The other said, "My sheep need to be fed here." They could not dwell together because their possessions were too great. Many people can leave Ur of the Chaldees together, but trouble begins to happen once they get to Canaan.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
