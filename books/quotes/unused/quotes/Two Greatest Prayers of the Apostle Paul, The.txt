Some may even consider that the church is a material building, but according to the Bible, the church is the deepest matter
Many may have a common or superficial understanding concerning the church, but it is not a simple or superficial matter
In the first prayer, Paul prays, 'That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom'
Medical doctors spend many years studying medicine, yet they still do not understand the human body thoroughly
Not only do we have a body with so many parts and a soul with so many organs, we have another part of our being, a deeper part, our spirit
Today there are so many divorces just because of this kind of endless fighting, but we Christians have a place to which we can retreat
While you are fighting with your spouse, you have to remember that you are a dear saint and that you have a regenerated spirit
We can never see the church, the mystery of Christ, merely by using our small mind to consider and try to understand it
If you have not seen the church, do not argue with others about this matter or try to understand it on your own
The Lord prayed that God's kingdom would come to earth and that His will would be done on earth as it is in the heavens
The Bible reveals that Hades, like Sheol in the Old Testament , is the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept
Our hope is not just Christ as our Redeemer or as our life, but Christ as our ultimate manifestation and consummation, as our glory
There may not be much in us that is good for God to inherit because very little of Christ has been wrought into us
All the dear saints will be His inheritance, and this inheritance will be Christ Himself wrought into all His believers in full
We all must realize that nothing of our natural life, nature, or makeup, nothing of our natural being, is a part of the church
We all must realize that our calling on the name of the Lord, our eating, drinking, and breathing of the Lord, must be for the church
Without being in such a local church and living the local church life, you will feel unsettled, as a homeless wanderer
In Ephesians 1, the main thing the Apostle Paul prayed for is for us to be given a spirit of wisdom and revelation
For centuries, Christianity has missed the mark of God's economy simply because they have neglected this basic matter-the human spirit
Some may speak often of the Holy Spirit, yet they do so in an objective way as if the Spirit were something far away from us
Although the church is a great subject in the Bible, the Apostle Paul's Epistle concerning the church is very short with only six chapters
If we are going to know the church, the main thing is not to exercise our mind to know the teachings, but to exercise our spirit
If she would have changed her position by turning herself from the mind to the spirit, she would have contacted the Lord Jesus
We may encourage them to turn to their spirit and wait in the presence of the Lord and see what the Lord would speak to them in their spirit
We may have the wisdom to know how to operate all the machines, but if the factory is not open to us, we cannot see anything
On the other hand, if the factory is opened, we can see everything, but if we do not understand the machines, our seeing means very little
Although this traditional thought is held by many Christians, it is superstitious and completely off the line of the revelation in the Bible
The Lord Jesus Himself has been building these mansions for over nineteen hundred years and still He is not finished
You are preparing a marvelous, gorgeous, all-splendid, big mansion in the heavens for me, still not yet finished'!
The Lord's word, 'I go to prepare a place for you' , does not mean that He has gone to the heavens to build a big mansion for us
God's intention in the Gospel of John is not to build a physical mansion in the heavens and then bring us there
As long as we are in the Lord and the Lord is in us, whether the abodes will be in the heavens or on earth should not matter
In John 2 the Fathers house is Gods temple and Gods temple is the Body of Christ the church produced out of the Lords death and resurrection
While the Lord was speaking this word, He was among His disciples, but it was not yet possible for them to be in the Father
The second matter that Paul prays for us to know is 'the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints'
Do not think that the church is an organization, a group of religious people, or any kind of social or religious entity
The third matter that the apostle prays for us to see is 'the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe'
We must all look to the Lord that our capacity may be enlarged that we may experience the power that is within us
As long as they can come and sit quietly and hear the choir sing and the pastor give a good sermon, they are content
Our wives may be opposing us, or our husbands may be bothering us, but we are sitting in the heavenlies, transcendent
We should not have outward regulations in the church life, but we need the subduing power to live a subduing life
Our spirit is for us to use as an organ to see the things of the church, but the inner man is not just an organ
Just as our body is an outward organ to contact the outward, physical world, our spirit is an inward organ to contact the spiritual world
Before being saved each of us was a soul a being a person with two organs the body as an outward organ and the spirit as an inward organ
Before we were saved, we had only one life, the soul-life, but now we have another life, the divine life in our spirit
If we live by the soul-life, psuche, we will be soulish, but if we live by the divine life, zoe, we will be spiritual
We should all desire to live by the life in our spirit, by the new divine life, zoe, and not by the old human life, psuche
If you are going to be strong in your inner man you have to subdue your temper and if you can subdue your temper you can subdue everything
We need to be desperate to experience this power that is within us so that our inner man might be strengthened
In chapter one, this power was toward us, but in chapter three, the strengthening is with this power into our spirit, into our inner man
The heart is composed of the three parts of the soul-the mind , the emotion , and the will -plus the conscience , a part of the spirit
When our inner man is strengthened there is a free way for Christ to take full possession of our entire being making His home in our hearts
We will be filled, not with doctrines or knowledge, but with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God
We are becoming a people filled up with the Triune God and saturated with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God
Paul says, 'But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us'
God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, but He is able only according to the power that is operating in us
We all have to realize our need for the inner operating, the energizing, of this power for the strengthening of our inner man
In these books Moses did not tell the Israelites how to kneel down, how to bow down, or how to prostrate themselves
From the books written by Moses, we can see that the worship God desires is not according to this religious concept
Because you have not gained anything of Christ, you come to the meeting with your hands empty, with nothing in your spirit
If you are laboring on Christ every day, experiencing and enjoying Him, you will surely gain something of Christ
In the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew circumcision and uncircumcision barbarian Scythian slave freeman but Christ is all and in all
Formerly you were a soulish person with the natural soulish human life but now you have the divine eternal uncreated life in your spirit
You may be an old babe, that is, a person who has been a Christian for many years with very little growth in life
Although a young brother may have been saved only a few years, he might have gained more Christ than they have
They may have a lot of knowledge in their soul, yet they may have gained very little of Christ in their spirit
Realizing that our former person has been crucified, we should not live in that person, by that person, or with that person anymore
We have to deny our former person which the Bible calls the old man and the outward man and we have to live by our new person the inner man
Is it being initiated by his former person or by his present person, by the old man or the new man, by the soulish man or the inner man?
It may be easy for us to learn this doctrine, but in most of our living, we may still be absolutely in our old man
To go to the department store to buy something is not bad or evil, but that may still be an activity of our former person
What does matter is who goes, the former person or the present one, the person in the soul or the person in the spirit
When these two, Christ as life and your spirit, are together as one, you have the personality of your new person
Regardless of how good, patient, humble, kind, and mild you are, as long as you are in the old person, you cannot experience the church life
We need the heavenly revelation so that we would drop all the wrong concepts we have collected from our background
We have to deny and renounce that old person, and we have to realize that we now have a new person, our spirit with Christ as its life
Today, we cannot see or realize that our new person is growing, but one day we will 'be no longer babes' and 'arrive at a full-grown man'
That full growth will be the accumulation of Christ as the reality in us through all of our experiences of Him
If we are going to visit a brother, we have to check whether this is our old person, our self, or our new person, our spirit
Even if a mother is going to talk to her children, she has to check whether her old person or her new person is going to talk
We are the newborn Christians, yet most of the time we live by our old person and not by the new person, our spirit
We all have to put off the old communal life, the worldly social life, and we have to put on the new communal life, the church life
We should not care for the adjustment of our outward behavior, but only for the inward shifting from the old person to the new person
