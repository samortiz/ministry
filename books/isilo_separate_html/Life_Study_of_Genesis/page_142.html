By His all-inclusive death on the cross Christ fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(1) The Requirement of God's Glory</H2><P>His redeeming death satisfied the requirements of God's glory. When He died the veil, in which were embroidered the cherubim of glory, was rent from top to bottom (Matt. 27:50-51). The fact that it was rent from top to bottom proves that it was a work accomplished by God and that the barrier between God and man had been removed. Man was short of God's glory, but now through the redemption that is in Christ man can be justified by God (Rom. 3:23-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(2) The Requirement of God's Holiness</H2><P>In the death of Christ on the cross God's holiness was satisfied. We are sanctified, made holy, through the offering of Christ once for all (Heb. 10:10). By His one offering Christ has perfected us in sanctification, in holiness (Heb. 10:14). He has sanctified us with His blood (Heb. 13:12). Through the death of Christ God's holiness is ours, and the requirement of His holiness is a problem to us no longer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(3) The Requirement of God's Righteousness</H2><P>The death of Christ has also honored God's righteousness. God made Christ sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). As the just One, He suffered for sins on behalf of the unjust (1 Pet. 3:18). Through the death of Christ the righteousness of God has become ours and it cannot keep us from the righteous God who is the tree of life. Thus, the way to the tree of life has been completely opened to us once again through the accomplishment of Christ's redemption.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>b) A New and Living Way Opened</H2><P>Since Christ has fulfilled the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, His blood has opened for us a new and living way (Heb. 10:19-20, 22). The word "new" in Hebrews 10:20 means "fresh," "recently made." We have such a fresh way, a way just recently made. By this new, fresh, and living way we have boldness to enter into the secret place where the tree of life is.</P><P>Do not be afraid of your sinful nature. It has been crucified on the cross. The sinful nature, the old man, the soul, the self, the ugly "I"&#151;all have been crucified on the cross. Therefore, God has the confidence to permit us to have eternal life. He is not afraid that we will live forever with our fallen nature because it has been terminated by the all-inclusive death of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>c) Man Permitted to Approach God<br>and Enjoy Him as Life</H2><P>Now we can draw nigh to God (James 4:8; Heb. 4:16; 10:19, 22). Through Christ's redemption God has come into our spirit. We need to turn to our spirit and through the blood of Jesus enter into the Holiest of all where we can touch the tree of life. This is wonderful. Today we are no longer under the anticipated redemption; we are enjoying the accomplished redemption. This redemption has opened a new and living way for us to enter into the Holiest of all. This way was not present in the garden, but it is now in our spirit. Therefore, we now have boldness to contact the living God who is the very tree of life. Because our robes have been washed we have the right to come to the tree of life and to enjoy its riches (Rev. 22:14).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_141.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_143.html">Next</a> </body></html>
