He loves the world. He is not willing to see any perish. He desires that all men be saved. He does not want to condemn man for his sins. Although the world-you and I included-are at enmity with Him, He patiently forbears. He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to the world to die on the cross for us, to be our propitiation, and to propitiate God's righteous wrath. He has suffered on our behalf all the punishment that we deserve for our sins. We disobey God, oppose Him, and hate Him. The perdition that we deserve because of our nature, mind, and conduct have been borne by Him. He stood in the place of the sinner and enemy, saying, at the time of His crucifixion, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). He is God's Beloved. God is pleased with Him, and God is always near to Him. By taking up our sins and standing on our behalf as an enemy to suffer God's righteous judgment of wrath, He saw the dear Father forsake Him. Through His death and rejection for us, He has accomplished peace and salvation once for all. What grace this is!</P><P>Therefore, dear ones, through the accomplished salvation of the Lord Jesus, we are "reconcile[d]...to God through the cross" (Eph. 2:16). We do not have to try to change for the better, mortify ourselves, or inflict pain upon ourselves. None of these can satisfy God's heart. Everything that we need is "through the cross." Salvation is accomplished; there is nothing more to add. The Lord Jesus has "made peace through the blood of His cross" (Col. 1:20). When the Lord Jesus suffered on the cross, He shed His blood. His blood speaks better things than the blood of Abel. Peace has been established. Christ has fully accomplished salvation for us. We do not have to accomplish anything or strive for anything because everything is done.</P><P>Before the Lord Jesus accomplished salvation, God loved the world, but the sin of the world forbade Him from drawing near to men and forbade men from drawing near to God. Now the Son of God has died. "God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself" (2 Cor. 5:19). Now the relationship between God and man is changed. The death of Christ did not change God's heart, because He has always loved the world. Neither has His death changed the heart of man, because the world still lives in sin and disobedience to God. But thank the Lord, when Christ died, the relationship between God and man changed. God has judged the Lord Jesus, and now He can receive the world without any obstacle. We can illustrate this matter with a story. Suppose that a judge had an only begotten son whom he loved dearly. Then the son stole some money which belonged to his father's office and ran away. Although the father still loved the son, the father-son relationship changed. Even though they were father and son, the father could not treat him as a son after he was caught. He must judge and condemn him, considering him the same as all the other criminals. Although his father loved him, the son could not break the law. But the father could sell his possessions to pay the penalties so his son could be free. Then the father could receive the son unhindered. We have sinned and offended God. We deserve to be judged and condemned. We deserve to suffer eternal perdition. But God loves us. He Himself came to be a man-the Lord Jesus is God-and He suffered on the cross to pay the debt of sin for us; He has changed the relationship between God and man. Now God can receive sinners. Peace is established. The question is whether or not man will receive this peace. This will determine his salvation or perdition.</P><P>Readers, are you at peace with God? Are you saved? Are you at peace with God through the Lord Jesus? God's way is "peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5:1), and to be "reconciled to God through the death of His Son" (v. 10). It is not your own merit that puts you at peace with God. You may be a church member; you may have been baptized and have partaken of Holy Communion. You may go to church, read the Bible, and pray often. You may even have exhorted others to believe in the Lord. You may be a preacher, one who bears responsibilities in the church, or a church leader. But if you are not reconciled to God through the death of the Lord Jesus and have not believed that His death is for the accomplishment of salvation and for the bearing of your sins, you are still God's enemy and a perishing sinner. Do not think that work and zeal will reconcile you to God. No, the price for reconciliation with God is not that cheap. If God considered the death of the Lord Jesus to be necessary, He will not be satisfied with anything less than the death of the Lord Jesus. Man either is reconciled to God through the Lord Jesus or remains God's enemy through rejecting the Lord and trusting in himself. The result is eternal perdition.</P><P>God has paid all the price. He has accomplished a full salvation. The Lord Jesus has fully accomplished peace. Salvation and perdition are before you. You cannot be saved by your righteousness, and you do not have to perish because of your sin. The question is whether or not you will trust in the Lord Jesus' accomplished salvation.</P><P>During the American Civil War, one winning general told the enemy troops, "I am now setting aside a few miles as the zone of peace. If any enemy soldier drops his weapon and steps into this zone, he will be spared from death. Otherwise he will be killed." Many who believed the general ran into this zone. Everyone who dropped his weapon was saved. Those who doubted and refused to walk into the zone were slaughtered. Dear ones, God has ordained the cross of Golgotha as the place of peace. You were at enmity with God. If you are willing to forsake your sins, stand on the ground of the cross, and trust in the peace that the Lord Jesus has accomplished, you will be saved. If you continue to doubt, you will die in your sins. Whether or not an enemy soldier will live or die depends on whether or not he will step into the zone. Perhaps some were standing outside the line; perhaps some were just a few feet away from the line and could have stepped inside with one stride. But they were still outside the line, and they were killed. Dear ones, do not delay! Do not miss by a step! Trust in the Lord and be saved. Why not do it now? "Let him who wills take the water of life freely" (Rev. 22:17). Come!</P><P>If you come and receive the Lord's accomplished peace, you will be delivered from your sins and need not fear the judgment of sin. The Scripture says, "God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them" (2 Cor. 5:19). What a joy this is! We will surely be saved. "We will be saved...having been reconciled" (Rom. 5:10). Since we have received salvation, sin will not condemn us anymore. What joy this is! "Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation" (v. 11).</P><P>Dear ones, let me ask you again: Are you reconciled to God? You should answer this question quickly. Your destiny depends on how you answer this question today. "On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God" (2 Cor. 5:20). "And coming, He announced peace as the gospel to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near" (Eph. 2:17). May the Holy Spirit touch the hearts of all those who read this article to receive the Lord as their Savior.</P><P>"Lord, I was Your enemy. Now through Your demonstration of love on the cross, and through the peace You established, I believe in You. Lord, save me, a sinner!"</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
