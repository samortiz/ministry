   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 A Shepherd</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This perfect aspect is a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Joseph, like Abel, was a shepherd 37:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This typifies the aspect of the constitution of Christ in the mature life that is the shepherding life to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter thirty-seven Joseph not only fed and shepherded the flock; although he was the second youngest brother, he was sent by his father to shepherd his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, Joseph shepherded not only his father's flock, but also his father's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus also came as a shepherd John 10:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although you may be new in the church life, you nevertheless have the constitution of Christ within you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ has been constituted into you, and this becomes the constitution of Christ in your spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what gives you the burden to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The constitution of Christ in our spiritual life has a shepherding aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is vain to encourage people to shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more I charge you to shepherd others, the less you will shepherd them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Shepherding is not a matter of our instigating others to do something, but of Christ's constitution within them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The part of our being that has been constituted of Christ is the part that shepherds others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have full confidence in that part of you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot shepherd anyone, but Christ constituted into us is the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reigning aspect is firstly the shepherding aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not have the burden to shepherd others and to feed them, you will never be able to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Reigning authority comes from the shepherding life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, Joseph reigned over his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But he did not reign over them until he had already shepherded them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was sent by his father to shepherd his brothers and to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, Jesus came not as a King to rule others; He came as a Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the Shepherd, Christ was killed by His own people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is revealed in John 10, where we are told that the good Shepherd gives His life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus came as the Shepherd and was killed, giving His life for His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In principle, the same thing happened to Joseph in chapter thirty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although he was sent to shepherd his brothers, they nearly killed him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph gave his life in order to carry out this kind of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is good that we have a shepherding life within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you are to shepherd others, you must be ready to be killed by those you are caring for.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The very ones you desire to shepherd will not appreciate your shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, they will kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They may think of you as a strange, peculiar person, and they may call you a "holy" brother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many have said to me, "Brother Lee, if I stay by myself and do not love the church and care for the saints, I have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when I begin to love the church and take care of the saints, the saints kill me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They kill you because you shepherd them.</S>
