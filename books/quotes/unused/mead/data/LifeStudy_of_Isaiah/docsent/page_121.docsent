   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jehovah Giving Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as a Covenant of the People</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Thus says Jehovah,/In an acceptable time I have answered You,/And in a day of salvation I have helped You; / And I will preserve You and give You for a covenant of the people,/To restore the land, to apportion the desolate inheritances,/To say to the prisoners, Come forth,/To say to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8-9a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah has been given as a covenant of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A covenant is a signed agreement between two parties, in which promises are made.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A covenant becomes a will upon the death of the covenanting party.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a will someone may promise to give all his riches to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The will becomes the title deed of all those riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if there are no actual riches to receive, the will is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is our will, our covenant, and He is all the riches given to us in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible is a will that mentions many wonderful items that are to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But without Christ as the reality, the Bible would be only empty pages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the reality of the items given as bequests in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is given as a covenant to restore the land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To restore the land is to accomplish something of God's economy concerning His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The restoring of the land is mainly for the kingdom of God, which will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our experience of Christ today, to restore the land means to have the land enlarged or expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To experience Christ as the expanding land is to occupy Christ as the land for the building up of God's kingdom that His temple, His testimony, may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have only the Bible but lack the experience of Christ as the reality, we do not have the feeling that Christ as the land is expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we have the Bible with the experiences of Christ, we sense that Christ as the land is expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we experience Christ, the more we sense that Christ is expanding within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we experience Christ in this way, the more God's kingdom is established with God's temple as His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE BLESSED RETURN OF THE CAPTIVES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah 49:9b-13 speaks of the blessed return of the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because Christ has become a covenant for the people of Israel, the captives will return.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. Not Hungering or Thirsting</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The captives will feed along the roads, and their pasture will be on all the bare heights.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will not hunger or thirst, neither the scorching heat nor the sun will strike them; for He who has compassion on them will lead them and will guide them beside the springs of water vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>9b-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the Lord not only leads us in a general way but also guides us in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. Jehovah Making All His Mountains into a Road</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 11 Jehovah says, "I will make all My mountains into a road,/And My highways will be raised up."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may apply this in a spiritual way to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before we returned to the Lord, we were lost, and we did not know where we were or where we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when we returned to the Lord, immediately there were roads and highways, and we knew what to do and where to go.</S>
