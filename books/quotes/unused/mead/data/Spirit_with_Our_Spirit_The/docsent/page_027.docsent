   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the beginning of the New Testament, we see the Holy Spirit, but He was still not yet "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is unveiled in John 7:39, which says, "The Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit was not yet because Jesus in His humanity had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because Jesus in His humanity had not yet been changed, the Holy Spirit who brought forth Jesus through His conception and birth still remained the same, without change.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not until Jesus was resurrected into His glory, that "the Spirit" who shall flow out of the believers as rivers of living water began to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This truth is a big "missing" among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Andrew Murray said that when "the Spirit" came into existence, this was a "new era," a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had the boldness to say that humanity had been constituted into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the time of Christ's resurrection, whatever has been constituted and wrought into Christ has been consummated in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today the Spirit of God is "the Spirit" who flows out of the believers in Christ as rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is another "missing" among today's Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The last Adam was Jesus in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He lived in the flesh for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then through resurrection, He changed by becoming a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word became in Greek is the same word used in John 1:14: "The Word became flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the Spirit changed from the Spirit of God to the Spirit who gives life, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians 15:45 is a great verse in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today some in Christianity pay much attention to John 1:14, but they do not see that the last Adam, who was flesh, became something further.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first step, He was the Word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the second step, He was the flesh becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The third "missing" among today's Christians is that they do not see that the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the completion of Christ's resurrection, He revealed this divine title to His disciples: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He passed through incarnation, human living, and death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In resurrection the Triune God was consummated by Jesus becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, it was not until the resurrection was completed, that this title the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit was clearly revealed in full.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The consummation of the Divine Trinity is the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, in the Bible there is a clear vision that the life-giving Spirit has been compounded.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the compounded Spirit, and within Him there is not only the divine element but also the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why I treasure chapter five of Andrew Murray's book The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Andrew Murray had the boldness to stress repeatedly that humanity is now an ingredient of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The compound ointment in Exodus 30 is a marvelous type of the compound anointing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to this type, the death of Christ with its effectiveness and the resurrection of Christ with its power are ingredients of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit today is an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A single item cannot be an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>An ointment is a compound of a number of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the fourth "missing" today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fifth "missing" is the seven Spirits spoken of in the book of Revelation 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To study the definition of the Spirit, we have to get into and stress these five "missings," which are covered in these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit, and this compound Spirit is the seven Spirits.</S>
