   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us come to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians see that God is the source of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They also see that everything they have comes through receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But there is a problem: Many Christians do not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that everything we have comes by receiving and that if we do not receive anything, we will be left with vanity and emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we still do not receive, and we still try to do things ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not overcome by the law of life; instead, we try to overcome by our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One reason is that the principle of Jacob is still in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The activity of the flesh is still present, the power of the soul is still present, and the natural life is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know doctrinally that God is the Initiator of everything, yet in reality we initiate many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We remember a doctrine for two weeks, but by the third week we have forgotten it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we try to initiate something again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We behave this way because Jacob is still present within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a doctrine of overcoming or a teaching of sanctification only tells us that everything comes from God and that everything is received, without telling us that the natural life needs to be dealt with, the doctrine of overcoming and the teaching of sanctification are incomplete and impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a teaching does not touch the soul-life, it will only make us happy for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then everything will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to see that God is the Head of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to see that we are those who receive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, we have to see that our natural life must be checked.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only then will we see the goodness of the Son and the way of submission to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether or not we can receive the promise of the Son and whether or not we can take the way of the Father depend on whether we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit and whether we are willing to have our natural life touched.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can see this from the life of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The outstanding characteristic of Jacob's natural constitution was his cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was an exceptionally clever person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He could deceive anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He deceived his brother, father, and uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He could devise anything, he could do everything, and he could achieve anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was not like his father, who was just a son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He went to his uncle empty-handed and came back with his hands full.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the lesson we learn from Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Abraham speaks to us of the Father, Isaac speaks to us of the Son, and Jacob speaks to us of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not mean that Jacob represents the Holy Spirit, but that his experiences represent the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jacob's history is a type of the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We see a crafty person who was filled with schemes and deceits.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But at the same time, we see a person whom the Holy Spirit disciplined step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He held his older brother's heel, yet he still ended up being the younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He supplanted his brother with a pottage of lentils and usurped the birthright, but he, not his brother, eventually had to run away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He received his father's blessing, but he, not his brother, became a wanderer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When he went to stay with his uncle, he wanted to marry Rachel, but Laban gave him Leah, not Rachel first.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For twenty years, the drought consumed him in the day, and the frost consumed him by night Gen 31:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Indeed, he lived a toilsome and hard life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these experiences were the discipline of the Holy Spirit; they were the trials that a clever man had to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who can scheme and who are resourceful will see God's hand upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The natural life has to be pressed out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jacob's history is a picture of the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some brothers and sisters are exceptionally clever, thoughtful, shrewd, calculating, and resourceful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we must remember that we do not walk in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God 2 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jacob experienced the continual discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, his cleverness was never able to have its way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the night at Peniel, Jacob learned the greatest lesson; it was actually the best night of his life!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He thought he could have his way with anyone and could similarly have his way with God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when he came face to face with God, God touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, and he became crippled Gen 32:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The sinew of the hollow of the thigh is the strongest sinew in the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For Jacob's hollow to be touched meant that God had touched the strongest part of his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From that day on, he was crippled!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before he was crippled, he was Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After he was crippled, Israel came into being v. 28 ! From that day on, he was no longer a supplanter but one who was being supplanted.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before that time, he deceived his father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After that day, he was deceived by his sons 37:28-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The formerly clever Jacob would never have been carried away by the deception of his sons, because he was such a deceiver himself; he would never have believed in others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more a person deceives, the more he does not trust in others, because he judges others according to his own heart.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But now things were different.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The latter Jacob was different from the former Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He no longer trusted in his own cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why he could be deceived by his own sons.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He shed many tears, and his natural strength was dealt with and was stripped away by God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the kind of experience that makes us the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One day God will shine on you and show you how evil, wicked, and conniving you are.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When God shows you who you are, you will not be able to lift up your head.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's light will terminate you and force you to admit that you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You will acknowledge that you dare not serve God anymore and that you are not qualified to serve Him any longer!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From that point on, you will no longer trust in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>EIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In conclusion, Abraham shows us that everything is of God; we cannot do anything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Isaac shows us that everything comes from God, and our place is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if we only receive and do not have the discipline of the Holy Spirit, something will go wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is what Jacob shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One day the Lord will come to us, touch us, and twist the hollow of our thigh; He will deal with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then we will become humble and follow the Lord in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then we will not be careless and make proposals rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How easy it is for us to make proposals, and how easy it is for us to act without prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>How easy it is for us to develop a confidence apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God has to touch our natural life in a drastic way; He has to break apart our natural life and show us that we can do nothing by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>From that day on, we will be lame men.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Being lame does not mean that we cannot walk; rather, it means that every time we walk, we realize our weakness and our lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the common trait of all those who know God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Before God brings a man to such a point, he does not have the experience of Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>All those who are still resourceful, confident, and powerful have not experienced the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>May God open our eyes to see the relationship between these three kinds of experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All three experiences are particular experiences, and yet all three are interrelated in their accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We cannot have just one or two of the three.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to be clear about all three experiences before we can advance in the way of God.</S>
