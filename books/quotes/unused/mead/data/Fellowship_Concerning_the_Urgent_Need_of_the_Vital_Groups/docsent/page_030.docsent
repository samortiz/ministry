   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Confessing Our Dispositional Problems</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Our Peculiarity in Our Character</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we need to confess our dispositional problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have many problems with our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Quite often we take an excuse by saying, I was born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the excuse of our dispositional problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to condemn our natural disposition, not excuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of us pray according to our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For certain brothers and sisters to pray short prayers is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If some of the saints prayed short prayers of two sentences in the prayer meeting, that would be a miracle because this is not according to their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not realize how bad we are naturally and dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also have the peculiarity in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to deal with this by thorough and much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot have such a thorough dealing within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Denying Our Self, Our Habit,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Our Old Way of Doing Things</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also need to deny our self, our habit, and our old way of doing things Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are so many troubles related to us which need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As fallen beings, we are a composition of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Having No More Confidence in Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and No More Trust in Our Natural Ability</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do we believe that today we have no more confidence in ourselves and no more trust in our natural ability?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this trust were taken away from us, we could not live.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We live because we have confidence in ourselves and trust in our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we trust in our ability, we cannot be blended with others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have even a little bit of self-confidence, self-trust, we cannot be blended with others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Loving All the Members of Our Group</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>with an Equal Love in the Love of God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to love all the members of our group with an equal love in the love of God Phil 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is difficult to find anyone who loves others with an equal love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We always love according to our preference and our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE NEED FOR MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>FOR OUR BLENDING AND FOR OUR DYNAMIC ACTIVITIES</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In serving the Lord, we have learned not to criticize or condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, to build up a church, the most needed thing for the leading ones is to know the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not know the saints, how can we build them up?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of us came together to study every saint in our arranging of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of the peculiarities of the saints, this was a difficult task.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One saint is too strong, while another is too soft.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One saint has a habit of praying too much to kill the meeting, but another never prays.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of us have our dispositional problems and the peculiarity in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All of us are descendants of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must go to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In these coming weeks, we have to go to the Lord in prayer every day to deal with all the above items.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to pray thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we pray, the more we will be dealt with in these items and the more we will be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then no one will be able to offend us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we are very sensitive because we have not allowed the Lord to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we come together in these days, we need to pray mainly for the blending.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The blending implies all these dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the fine flour is to be blended into dough, we cannot have any hard pieces remaining in the flour.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are many hard pieces still remaining in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since this is the case, how can we be blended with others?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no other way for us to be blended except by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are dealt with to the extent which we have talked about, we will not be able to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Someone may tell us that we are not so nice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may respond, You are right.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am even worse than what you know.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we come together, we should pray for our being blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The second thing we have to pray for is our dynamic activities.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to pray for our function, for our activities.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Eventually, we need to go out to bring people to Christ and to keep people in Christ and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need something dynamic, and this needs our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before the day of Pentecost, the one hundred twenty prayed together for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot do anything without prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to be blended together by thorough and much prayer so that we can go out dynamically.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to pray for our blending and for our dynamic activities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>QUESTION: I realize that we need much and thorough prayer, but when I start to pray, it seems that I do not have that much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How do we pray thoroughly?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>ANSWER: Our concept is that thorough prayer is to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul, however, said that we do not know what to pray but the Spirit helps us in our weakness, interceding for us with groanings which cannot be uttered Rom 8:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We do not know how we should pray; hence, we groan v. 23 . In our groaning the Spirit groans also, interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In our dealing with the Lord, we may groan, O Lord, my character.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>My character, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What shall I do, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is thorough prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to cry out to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many of us are too nice.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the Spirit is on us, however, we will forget about being nice.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The less words we speak the better.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But the more we groan and cry out to the Lord, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we could kneel for thirty minutes, groaning and crying out to the Lord, this is the best prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need the Lord s breaking through His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Otherwise, it will be hard for us to exercise the spirit because we are too much in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The many items we have in our prayer are evidence that we are in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Paul s word in Romans 8 concerning coming to the Lord to groan is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We might pray, O Lord, I don t know what to pray, but I know my natural man is condemned and my character has a lot of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we try to explain things in our prayer, we may be able to do this for only ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then our speaking will be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But we can never graduate from groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have to learn to shout, to cry out, and to groan.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>QUESTION: Is it wrong not to be able to pray in a group if you feel like someone has done something against you?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>ANSWER: As long as we can be offended, we are a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to pray, Lord, save me from the feeling that I have been wronged.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Lord, I am still so natural.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I am still so much in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is a good prayer, a genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Such prayer always conveys a certain amount of enlightenment and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When we pray in our natural way, our prayer is darkening; it does not enlighten.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>QUESTION: What should we pray for when we come together in our vital groups?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>ANSWER: In this period of time, we should pray only for our blending and for the activities of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should pray for these two things privately and when we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We cannot pray too much for them.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We should pray, Lord, blend us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Blend me with the others in my group so that we can have the impact in our activities.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should forget about all other things and focus on this.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Confessing is a very crucial part of the blending.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Without confessing, we cannot be blended with others.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>A prayer life is a life that revolts and rebels against our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If we are naturally nice, this may prevent us from crying out by the inspiration of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>According to our natural being, we may pray too much and too long, not caring for others but only for our own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Others are naturally silent.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We have to rebel against our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>A prayer life is a rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Some who were born so bold have to rebel against themselves to be silent for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The real prayer life stops our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Prayer is the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If you do not release your spirit, you can never receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This may be likened to a water hose.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>When water is coming out of the hose, this means that water is coming into it.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Thus, to release our spirit is to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>But a number of us would not care for the release of the spirit but only for our habitual prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Some bold and talkative ones should not pray in the prayer meetings for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>This is what it means to rebel against our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Sometimes we pray so fast that no one can follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Paul indicated that we need to pray in a way that others can say Amen to our prayer 1 Cor 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Based upon this principle, we have to pray audibly so that others can hear our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We have to pray by crying, by shouting, or in a proper, audible way.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Some of us need to slow down our speaking so that others can hear us and say, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>By this fellowship we all can realize that our habitual way is the killing way.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We have killed the church life without any awareness.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The Christian life is a life of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>To pray is to exercise our spirit, to release our spirit, that we may receive more of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>When more water goes out through the hose, more water comes in. If we stop the going out, the coming in is also stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The release of our spirit is the receiving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We have been building up ourselves for too long, so it is really hard for the Spirit to do anything through us.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Also, it is hard for us to exercise our spirit because we are so natural.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We do not have the habit of using our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>We are habitual in using all the other parts of our being, but not our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>QUESTION: When we pray corporately, does it matter if we say I or we in our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>ANSWER: This question indicates that you are in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When you are releasing the spirit, the Spirit leads you.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>If He leads you to say I, you say I. If the Spirit leads you to say we, you say we.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>There is no legality.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>When you try to pray in the meeting, you must get yourself prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>You are not going to speak something common.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>You are going to say something particular.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>This is a petition expressed to the throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>It is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Do not pray in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>It is the same thing in speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>We must get ourselves prepared to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>This is to rebel against our self.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>If we are willing to be corrected and rescued from our habitual ways, this will be a big blessing to the church meetings.</S>
