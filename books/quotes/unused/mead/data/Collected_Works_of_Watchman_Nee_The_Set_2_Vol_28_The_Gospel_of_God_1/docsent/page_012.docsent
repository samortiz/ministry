   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE NATURE OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the first evening we discussed the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last night we spoke about God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we did not finish these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we will continue the two previous messages and cover the matters of grace and sin further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we have to see what is the nature of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What characteristics does grace have?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We treasure the love of God, for without God's love as the source, there would not be the flow of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flow of salvation issues from the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, without God's mercy there would be no possibility of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because God has shown mercy on us, He has given us His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's salvation is the concrete expression of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we treasure love, and we also treasure mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the most precious of all that reaches us is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love is indeed good, but it does not give any concrete benefit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mercy is also very good, but it also does not bring us any direct benefit; however with grace there is a direct benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, grace is more precious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Testament is filled, not with the love of God, nor with the mercy of God, but with the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace is God's love coming forth to accomplish something for the fallen, lost, and perishing sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we not only have an abstract love and a sentimental mercy, but we have grace to meet our needs in a concrete way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may think that it is wonderful enough if God is merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A fleshly or fleshy person will think that mercy is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Old Testament is filled with words of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are not many words on grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When man is in the flesh, he thinks that mercy is enough, that there is no need for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He thinks this way because he does not consider sin to be something serious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If man were without food or clothing or housing, mercy would not be adequate; there would also be the need of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the problem with sin is not a lack of food, clothing, or housing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The problem with sin is unrest in man's conscience and judgment before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this, man thinks that if only God would be merciful to us and be a bit more lenient, everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God would overlook our sins, it would be good enough for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our hearts we hope that God would be merciful to us and let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man's concept is to let go and to overlook.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God cannot mercifully overlook our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He cannot let us get by loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He must deal thoroughly with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only does God have to show mercy on us; He has to give us grace as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What issues out from God's love is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is not satisfied with mercy alone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We think that if there were mercy and that if God would let us go and not reckon with us, everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God did not say that since He has pity on us He would let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not the way God works.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God works, He must do so in harmony with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, God's love cannot stop with mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His love must extend into grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He must deal thoroughly with the problem of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the problem of sins were something that could be overlooked, God's mercy would be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to Him, letting us go and overlooking our sins are not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus to have mercy alone is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must settle the matter of sins thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we see the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why the New Testament, though not void of mercy, is full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In it we see how the Son of God, Jesus Christ, has come to the world to show forth grace and to become grace so that we might receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Grace is nothing other than God's great work accomplished freely in His unconditional and boundless love for helpless, unworthy, and sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's grace is just God working for man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How does this contrast with the law?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The law is God requiring man to work for Him, while grace is God working for man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The law is God's demand for man to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is work?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Work is man's effort to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Grace is neither God requiring something nor God receiving man's work, but grace is God doing His own work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When God comes forth to do something for and on behalf of man, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The emphasis in the New Testament is not on the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In fact, the New Testament opposes the principle of the law because law and grace can never mix.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is it God who is working or is it man who is working?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Is God giving something to man or is He asking for something from man?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If God is asking for something from man, we are still in the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But if God is giving something to man, we are in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You would not go to someone's home to give him money while you are there to collect money.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Likewise, law and grace are opposite principles; they cannot be put together.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If man is to receive grace, he must put the law aside.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the other hand, if he follows the law, he will fall from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If man is to follow the law, he must have God accept his works.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If there is the principle of the law and of works and if man is to give something to God, he must give God what He demands.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Bible indicates that man's works should be a response to God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's law demands that I do something.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When I do it, I am responding to God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is what the Bible calls works.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But when grace is here, the principle of law and of works is set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Here we see that it is God working for man instead of man working for God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Grace, which is God working for helpless, poor, and troubled man, has three characteristics or natures.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Everyone who wants to understand God's grace must remember these three characteristics or natures.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we forget these three characteristics, we as sinners will not be saved, and we as Christians will fail and fall.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we see the characteristics and nature of God's grace, we will receive more grace from God for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Let us consider briefly these three characteristics from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What are man's works?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Generally speaking, there are three things to man's work: 1 his wrongdoings, 2 his achievements, and 3 his responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The works of man that are evil are his wrongdoings, those that are good are his achievements, and those that he is willing to bear are his responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Here we have three things: of the things that man does, those that are not done well become his wrongdoings, those that are done well become his achievements, and those that he promises to do for God are his responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In terms of time, wrongdoings and achievements are things of the past, and responsibilities are things of the future; they are things that a man is responsible for.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If God's grace is God working for sinful, weak, ungodly, and helpless man, right away we see that God's grace and man's wrongdoing cannot be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Neither can God's grace be joined with man's achievements and responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Where the question of wrongdoing comes into play, grace does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Where the question of achievement comes into play, grace also does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Likewise, where responsibility is, grace does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If God's grace is indeed grace, wrongdoings, achievements, and responsibilities cannot be mixed in. Whenever wrongdoings, achievements, and responsibilities are mixed in, God's grace loses its characteristics.</S>
