   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Time Unknown</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The time of the Lord s secret coming is unknown 3:3; Matt 24:36, 42; 25:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ comes again, He will come as a Sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of this, in Revelation He is called the Angel, One who is sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His second coming, as in His first, Christ will come as One who has been sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the reason that only the Father knows the time of Christ s secret coming Matt 24:36; Mark 13:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father is the Sender and the Son is the Sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the Sender, not even the Sent One, knows the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people, seeming to know more than the Lord Jesus, have predicted the time of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the past century and a half, there have been many predictions, none of which has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some predicted that the Lord Jesus would come on a certain date and charged people to prepare themselves by taking a bath and by putting on clean, white clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others have climbed to a mountaintop to await the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After World War I, many teachers published books about prophecy, especially concerning the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some of these writers also predicted the time of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these predictions about the time of the Lord s coming have been proved false.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Be careful not to predict anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Bible, the time of the Lord s secret coming is unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. The Place in the Cloud to the Air</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The place of the Lord s secret coming will be in the cloud to the air 10:1; 1 Thes 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cloud is related to the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ went to heaven on a cloud, and He will come back to earth in the same way Acts 1:9, 11; Matt 26:64; Rev 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Matthew 26:64, the Lord Jesus said to the high priest, Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even with the Lord s coming in the cloud there are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Firstly, the Lord will come in the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that He will be concealed by the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Secondly, He will come upon the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He comes in the cloud, He will not come to the earth but to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 10:1 reveals that the Lord will come down out of heaven clothed with a cloud, indicating that He will be wrapped up with the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that He will suddenly descend from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is now on the throne in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the proper time comes, the Father will send Him from the throne in the heavens to the cloud in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we shall see in later messages, before He leaves the throne in the heavens, some overcomers will have been raptured to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 12 shows that the man-child will be raptured, not to the air but to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that some overcomers will have been raptured even before the time of the secret coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 14 we see the firstfruits on Mount Zion in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mount Zion in the heavens is where God is in the third heaven; it is not in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That the firstfruits will be on Mount Zion in the heavens proves that some of the early overcomers will be raptured to the third heaven before Christ s secret coming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After these early overcomers have been raptured, Christ will descend from the throne to the air in the cloud secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While He is in the air, the Lord Jesus will do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mainly, He will take up all the believers who have not yet been raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After Christ comes to the air in the cloud, many saints will still not have been raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, while He is in the air, He will rapture the Christians who have had to pass through the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Thessalonians 4:17 says that they who are alive and remain will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, in the air, Christ will set up His judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This judgment will not be for sinners but for all the saved ones, and it will not be concerned with salvation or perdition but with reward or punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After this judgment has been executed, some of the saints will be chosen to receive a positive reward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the Bible, God has had two selections concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Firstly, He selected us before the foundation of the world in eternity past Eph 1:4 ; secondly, after the Lord comes to the air and has raptured all the saints to the air, He will make a second selection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While the first selection in eternity past was for salvation, the second selection in the air at the judgment seat of Christ will be for reward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have been selected for salvation, but whether or not we receive a reward will depend upon the second selection at Christ s judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those saved ones who do not pass this judgment will be put somewhere to suffer discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ will then bring the positive ones with Him to the earth as His army.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time, He will no longer be in the cloud but upon the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, there will be at least two steps to the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the first step, Christ will leave the throne in the heavens, come down to the air wrapped in the cloud, and remain there for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then, from the air, He will take the second step of coming to the earth upon the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This will be the second aspect of His coming back.</S>
