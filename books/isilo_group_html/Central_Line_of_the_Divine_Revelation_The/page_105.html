We trust in You and believe that You are with us. We also have the confidence and assurance that we are under Your care. Lord, we are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing. But praise You that we have You as the all-inclusive Christ. Today we are coming to Your Word to learn of You and to learn how to experience and enjoy You. Lord, do open Yourself to us. We trust in You for Your move and Your work. Lord, we remember those saints who are now moving and working in Moscow. Lord, do remember them. We thank You for this moment, for Your presence, and for all things. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE WAY TO RECEIVE, EXPERIENCE,<br>AND ENJOY THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST<br>AS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT&#151;<br>THE AGGREGATE OF THE ALL-EMBRACING BLESSING<br>OF THE FULL GOSPEL OF GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Way in the Rest of the Books<br>of the New Testament</H2><P>In the previous messages we have seen the way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in the book of Galatians and the Gospel of John. In this message we will begin to see the way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ in the rest of the books of the New Testament.</P><P>First, we will consider sixteen items related to the way in Romans, 1 Corinthians, and 2 Corinthians. The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in these books is related to the Spirit. The blessing is the Spirit, and the way to experience and enjoy such a Spirit is also the Spirit. On the one hand, the Spirit is the blessing, and on the other hand, the Spirit is the way for us to participate in the blessing. Both the blessing and the way are the all-inclusive Spirit, and this Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_104.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_106.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 105</div><br></body></html>
