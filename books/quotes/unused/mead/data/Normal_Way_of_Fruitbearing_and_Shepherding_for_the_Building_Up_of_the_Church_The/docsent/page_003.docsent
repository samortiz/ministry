   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Lack of Training Exposed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Shortage of Proper Leading Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in the Migrations</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the work began in the United States, we were in the first stage.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, there was no need for a training, and on the other hand, I did not have time to do the training.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I needed more time for travel and other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason that before 1970 we did not have a formal training.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, beginning from 1968 we had an informal training.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A great need for the informal training was related to migrations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After our summer conference in Los Angeles on Bonnie Brae Street in 1964, many were excited and wanted to go out to take the country in the way of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I did not feel that this was the time to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An army cannot go to fight without training.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This only exposes them to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, some still wanted to go out, and I did not insist that they stay.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All who went out, though, returned in defeat by the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The following year we moved to Elden hall, and after two more years, in 1967, some still longed to go out to establish the local churches in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, I still felt that the time was not ripe and that the migration should wait a few more years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Finally, in the fall of 1969, there was a migration from Yorba Linda to Seattle and from three small cities in Texas to Houston.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then in 1970 further migrations took place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without exception, the first stage of all the migrations was a success.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although in the six years from 1964 to 1970 we had not had a formal training, a proper leadership had been produced among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wherever the migrations went, they went with a proper leadership; therefore, they were a success.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, there were more migrations in 1973, but almost none was a success.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because we were short of the proper leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After remaining in the new localities for a year, many of the saints could not go on, but they dared not go back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They simply remained there in a suffering way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, many who had gone out consolidated into churches in certain major cities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shortage of the proper leadership exposes our further need for training.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time I went to the Lord very much concerning my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord has made it clear that my ministry in this country to serve the saints should be different from what it was in the previous twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The previous twelve years was the first stage among us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I needed to travel for the setting up of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now there are thirty-five churches in this country, and my time and strength do not allow me to visit them all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Among the approximately five thousand saints in the Lord s recovery, there is not the adequate leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even in Anaheim alone there are enough saints to become two churches, but we do not have the proper leadership to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, there is now the need of a continual training.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord has shown me that from now on I must spend all my time in the ministry for the training.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The training is not for acquiring mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is for practice and the proper discipleship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The training builds us up in the growth of life, in character, and in dealing with the natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Character is our disposition plus our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need a change in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even more deeply, the training touches our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, it is not our nature but our disposition that needs to be touched and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are trained in this way even for only a few months, we will see a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE PURPOSE OF OUR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING TO MINISTER LIFE TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first point for our training is to realize that in the church service we do not do anything in the way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is an organism, and what an organism needs is life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, our church service is mainly for ministering life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even the arranging of chairs and the cleaning of restrooms are not for themselves; they are for ministering life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In ushering, clerical work, and any aspect of the church service, we must do everything to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, it is good for us to do things in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not doing things well can be a frustration, but this does not mean that merely doing a good job is to have the proper service.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In worldly religious organizations it is sufficient to do the jobs well, but in the church the main thing we need is the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even if we cannot do things very well, but by His mercy we minister life to others, the service is still successful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The main matter is to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may say that it is not we but the Lord Jesus who is the Life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, there is at least one verse in the New Testament that says we can give life to the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First John 5:16a says, If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask and he will give life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Life here in Greek is not bios, the physical life; it is zoe, the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This verse does not mean that if we pray for the brother s sickness, we can impart physical life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is that we give him zoe, the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have the privilege of giving life to the weaker ones in order to swallow up their death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many saints are not sick physically, but they are sick spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They need us to pray for them and to give them life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all need to be trained and to practice to take care of the weaker ones who are short of life and sick spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the churches it is often the case that death, rather than life, spreads from mouth to mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, there is the need of some stronger ones to minister life to stop the spread of death and to swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the main purpose of the service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The best opportunity for us to minister life to others is in the service groups.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many saints who have a heart for the Lord have been placed into these groups under the care of the responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The leading ones in the service should not care merely for doing things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The main thing they must do is care in life for all the ones who serve in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They must help the saints not primarily to carry out the service; rather, they should fellowship with them and minister life to them so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the leading ones do this, spontaneously all the saints will do the same for others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then the entire church will be under the care of the proper ministry of life.</S>
