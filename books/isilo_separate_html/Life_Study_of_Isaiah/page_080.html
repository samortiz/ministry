Jehovah's Judgment</H2><P>In Isaiah 29:1-12, 14-16 we see Jehovah's judgment on the hypocrisy of the worshippers in Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Distressing Ariel</H2><P>According to verses 2 through 8, Jehovah will distress Israel. The nations will fight against her and her stronghold.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Pouring Out<br>upon Them a Spirit of Deep Sleep,<br>and Shutting Their Eyes, the Prophets,<br>and Covering Their Heads, the Seers</H2><P>Verse 9 says that they are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with liquor. Jehovah has poured out upon them a spirit of deep sleep and has shut their eyes, the prophets; and their heads, the seers, He has covered (v. 10). All the vision will be to them like the words of a book that has been sealed (vv. 11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Lord Doing Something Wondrous with Them</H2><P>Verse 14 tells us that the Lord will do something wondrous with them, something wondrously marvelous; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of those who understand will be hidden. Verses 15 and 16 go on to say, "Woe to those who hide deeply/Their counsel from Jehovah,/And whose deeds are in the dark/And who say, Who sees us? and, Who knows us?/You turn things upside down!/Shall the potter be considered to be like the clay,/ That what is made should say to him who made it, He did not make me,/Or what is formed should say to him who formed it, He has no understanding?" These verses reveal that the hypocritical worshippers were in darkness and were without wisdom. They had even turned things upside down.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Issuing In the Restoration</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment on the hypocrisy of Jerusalem's worshippers issues in the restoration (vv. 17-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Lebanon Being Turned into a Fruitful Field</H2><P>In the restoration, Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered to be a forest (v. 17). This indicates that Lebanon will be flourishing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Deaf Hearing the Words of the Book</H2><P>The deaf will hear the words of the book, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see (v. 18).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
