<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:13, Paul says, &ldquo;And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.&rdquo; In the first book to the Corinthians Paul tells them to speak in the Holy Spirit. Now in the second book he says that he spoke by the spirit of faith. Christians today have paid much attention to the speaking in the Holy Spirit in 1 Corinthians. But to my knowledge, no one has ever paid much attention to the speaking by the spirit of faith.</p>
<p>In verse 7 Paul speaks of the treasure in earthen vessels, the very Christ as the radiance of God who was radiated into his being. Following this, he said that the putting to death of Jesus was working on the apostles and that the life of Christ was manifested in them (v. 11). At this point he mentioned the same spirit of faith. In ancient time the psalmist had the spirit of faith (Psa. 116:10). Now they the apostles also had the spirit of faith. They believed, therefore they also spoke. What did they speak? They spoke their experience. It was not just a certain doctrine, a certain point concerning the Triune God, but the experience of the death, life, and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Even though Paul was not speaking with his tongue, he was speaking by his pen. When he was writing, he had the spirit of faith. He wrote with boldness, with the spirit of faith. Without the spirit of faith, I may speak to you about my experience of the Lord&rsquo;s death, life, and resurrection in this way: &ldquo;Dear saints, thank the Lord I am really not worthy, but His mercy has put me here. You know I am so weak. I want to tell you that I have been put to death quite often; I am so shameful. A number of times I was really dead. But through much suffering and much prayer, yesterday I was resurrected. Still, this morning I am so weak; probably you can realize I am even sleepy.&rdquo; What kind of speaking is this? In this speaking there is no spirit, no faith. If Paul were here, he would say, &ldquo;Dear saints, let me tell you, the putting to death of Jesus has been upon me all the day. Praise Him, His life is also manifested upon me. I say this by the spirit of faith!&rdquo; This makes quite a difference. Regrettably, in many of the meetings the dear ones who share speak in the former, poor way. When they speak, there is no spirit. When they speak, there is no faith.</p>
<p>About one hundred years ago Dean Alford wrote concerning the spirit of faith, &ldquo;Not distinctly the Holy Spirit,&mdash;but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.&rdquo; What is referred to here as the human disposition is actually the human spirit. Even by that time the saints did not know much about the human spirit. No writers ever spoke much about the human spirit until the beginning of this century. Mrs. Penn-Lewis in one book spoke strongly concerning the difference between the human spirit and the soul, and we received much help from her. We have continued to study this and have developed it to the uttermost. Now among us even the little ones know that the Holy Spirit mingles Himself with our human spirit. The spirit here is not only the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit with our human spirit (Rom. 8:16).</p>
<p>Vincent in his word study of the New Testament followed Dean Alford, saying the same thing: &ldquo;Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both.&rdquo; He used the word blending. There is a blending between the Holy Spirit and our human spirit. This is what we call the mingled spirit. We have the mingled spirit of faith.</p>
<p>Faith is a wonder, a miracle within us. Every genuine Christian has such a wonder, a miracle within him. No one can describe or explain it, but we do have such a thing. We have illustrated this by the action of a camera. The camera has a lens outside and film within. Opposite the camera there is scenery. Also, light is needed. When you click the shutter, the light shines onto the film. There is an exposure, and a picture is produced. This exposure describes the operation of faith. We are just like a camera. The gospel described in the New Testament is the scenery, the Holy Spirit is the heavenly light, and our spirit is the film. When you hear the speaking of the gospel once, twice, even four or five times, there is a click within you. Whatever is described in the speaking would then be in your spirit. No one could ever remove it from you. That is faith.</p>
<p>Now by this faith you could go everywhere to tell people that Jesus is the Savior. One may ask, &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; You just know. They do not believe it, but you believe. There is no way to drop what we have received in this way. Once this click occurs in you, it remains forever. Now wherever we go we would tell people that Jesus is the Savior: &ldquo;He is living and He lives in me!&rdquo; In this way you speak by the spirit of faith. In my speaking you could realize that I am so strong and very bold. Why am I so bold? I have the spirit of faith. I speak, not by my mind, but by the spirit of faith.</p>
<p>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. This can be illustrated by the situation with an angry person. When one is angry at someone, his anger is not in his mind. The anger is in his spirit. Every angry person does not exercise his mind. If he would get into his mind and consider a little, he would not be mad. This is why when you preach the gospel, you should not stir up the person&rsquo;s mind. If you stir up their mind, they would not believe. You should rather induce him into the spirit. Then you can complete the transaction. When we get into our mind, faith, like anger, will be gone. In such a state I may testify, &ldquo;Well, I just came here yesterday to visit the church, but a brother told me this morning you are going to have a meeting, and he asked me to give a testimony. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I even don&rsquo;t know whether what I am going to tell you is really of the spirit or from my mind. I just don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; This kind of testimony will kill the entire meeting. No doubt I would be speaking from my thoughtful mind. I must rather give a living testimony, testifying boldly, &ldquo;Saints, Hallelujah! Oh the Lord Jesus is living! I want to tell you that He is living. He lives in me. And He was so living yesterday.&rdquo; Then I would continue to tell you much more by the spirit of faith.</p>
<p>This is what the church needs for edification, for the building up. Speaking in tongues, even the genuine tongues, does not build the church (1 Cor. 14:4). What builds the church? Prophesying, that is, speaking Jesus, speaking Christ, builds up the church. So Paul said, &ldquo;I would rather speak five words with my mind...than ten thousand words in a tongue.&rdquo; Ten thousand words in a tongue means nothing in the church meetings; but the plain words spoken by anyone by the spirit of faith and in the Holy Spirit builds the church. Therefore, we all have to practice everywhere to speak. We speak on the street; we speak in the classroom; we speak in the office; we speak at home; we speak to everybody, to all kinds of persons; and, we especially speak in the meetings, even the more in the home meetings. Learn to speak this way. This kind of speaking enlivens, this kind of speaking refreshes, this kind of speaking makes people new, this kind of speaking makes people strong and happy, and this kind of speaking imparts life to others and dispenses the Triune God into the listeners. This kind of speaking will overcome any kind of opposing environment. We must speak, speak in the Holy Spirit and speak by the spirit of faith. If everyone would become a speaker, a speaking witness, the situation would be overturned. This kind of speaking is a strong testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must not simply have a congregation with a speaker, hymns, a prayer, a speech, and so forth; we must be different. We must be revolutionized to have new meetings with everybody speaking. There should be no chairman, no one presiding. Everybody speaks everywhere, anytime, to anyone. We speak in the Holy Spirit and by the spirit of faith.</p>
