   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Very few babies die after being delivered today in the United States because after the delivery the modern hospitals have the best way to protect, shepherd, and feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Premature or sick babies are even put in an incubator for protection and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should keep going back to the new ones again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We meet with them, not in the hall but in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of meeting in the homes will shepherd them and will keep us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To come to the hall to big meetings week after week on the one hand helped us and on the other hand killed our function.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some who came into the church life were initially very active, but eventually after attending big meetings for a length of time they became dormant and out of function with no interest and no incentive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if we have new ones to take care of, this will be our incentive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our trainees have been trained not to spend too long a time at a home meeting, only twenty or at the most thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to take care of two home meetings in one hour or four home meetings in two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you go to the home meetings you have set up to visit all these new ones, you will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most of the nurses in the hospital who take care of the newborn babes are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The new ones that you have to nourish will become an incentive to you to encourage you to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What happiness this will be!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then maybe once a month or every two months, the whole church can come together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What a church life that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How will you feel when you see forty-five of your fruit in the meeting whom you baptized in the bathtubs?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then when the Lord comes back, you will be bold to go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the ones you brought to the Lord will be your joy and your crown at the Lord's coming 1 Thes 2:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will change, revolutionize, and transfer the church life into another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This all depends on our faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we say we live Christ but by what way?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just by having morning watch, reading the Bible in our home, and coming to the meetings on the Lord's day?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are living Christ, we will release Christ out of our being to bear fruit, and our fruit will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the real church life and the real Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>PUTTING THE NEW WAY INTO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TO SEE THE LORD'S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your success in the new way depends upon your practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the right practice, you will eventually discover all the necessary details.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I assure you the blessing will be there with you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord will bless your knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord will bless your setting up home meetings, and He will bless all the home meetings if you will practice this way according to what I have instructed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not use any natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The natural way will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Go strictly according to the instruction of the Lord's new way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you will be faithful to put all these things into practice, there will be some among you to help you to understand all the fine details.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe everyone can bring in one a month and that the home meetings will be very much blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The new ones will learn to go out knocking on doors, to take care of their home meetings, and after two or three years to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then you have to seek the Lord's leading when to set up the Lord's table with them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Maybe after a certain time they can have the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to teach them how to live the Christian life, including their giving something to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not use the old way; everything must be new.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then you will see the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way for the Lord to carry out His eternal economy that He may prepare His bride for His second coming.</S>
