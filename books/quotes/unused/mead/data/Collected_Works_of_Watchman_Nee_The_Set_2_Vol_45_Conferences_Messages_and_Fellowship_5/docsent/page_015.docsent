   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ON MIRACLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Faith should be a very spontaneous thing in a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One should not need to exercise any effort to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a man has to strive and struggle to believe, his faith is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One brother testified that when he was a young believer, he had to exert considerable effort to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first time he preached the gospel to others, he spent much time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seemed as if he had to collect a great deal of "faith" from somewhere and stuff himself with this "faith."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God was merciful to him and answered his prayer in many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But to an outsider, his struggle appeared very painful, and his "faith" was very unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today believers should pray to God in a very ordinary way, and God answers their prayers in a very ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Indeed, this is what a miracle is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every miracle worker should not be conscious of his miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A man who feels that performing a miracle is a strange thing is one who is far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who dwell in God's house do not consider miracles a strange thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But those who dwell in their tents consider miracles to be a strange thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moses performed many miracles, but he did not feel anything strange.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he led the Israelites through the Red Sea, the sea parted in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses did not think that he was performing a miracle, he just did it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Israelites believed without fanfare, and it just happened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith and miracles are something spontaneous for those who know God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In America some Christians say that all believers should practice Mark 16:17-18: "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They purposely put cobras in front of believers and allow the snakes to bite them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who are bitten eventually die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who practiced such things have a wrong motive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They consider miracles to be a kind of performance and use them to show off their power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Miracles are nothing extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Paul was bitten by the serpent once, he simply cast it into the fire Acts 28:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To him, it was as common as a mosquito bite.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not say to the natives of Malta, "Come, and I will show you a great miracle."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did not promote anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A man who genuinely knows God does not promote miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, a man who does not promote miracles does not necessarily know God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we can say with certainty that those who know God do not promote miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we try to put God's promises to the test by claiming Mark 16:17-18, it will be a very strange thing if God gives us any experience at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if we say that we have had the experiences of Mark 16:17-18, there will still be doubt that our faith is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God performs miracles when there is the need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man cannot call forth miracles by his own making.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Miracles are done unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anything done in a conscious way is not a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The result of faith is unnoticeable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may not know if you have faith, but things happen spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Genuine miracles are acts that one performs unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter's shadow healed the sick Acts 5:15 , but he did not notice it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He probably did not realize that his shadow was healing others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If others hit me, I can feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if they hit my shadow, I cannot feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the case with Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once George M ller prayed in a ship for the fog to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I myself also prayed in Plum Village for rain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But these miracles never repeat themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Neither of these miracles were performances; they were not done to demonstrate one's power.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They merely gave men a glimpse of God's greatness, power, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We often use a verse to test God or wrestle with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 7:18 says, "For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps we can also say, "For to will is present with me, but to work out the miracle is not."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Genuine miracles are a mystery even to those who perform them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we commit ourselves to God's hand, things happen.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God can perform miracles through us, but He will not allow us to be conscious of them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Someone once asked George M ller if he had the gift of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He answered that he had the grace of faith rather than the gift of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's power is great; He can do everything by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He does not need us to help Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Faith is spontaneous for those who genuinely trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is no effort involved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They live in a simple way and recognize that God is doing everything rather than themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE CHRISTIAN PATHWAY</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may think that God has given us many different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Actually those who have many ways do not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A man who really knows God does not have many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When God reveals Himself to man, He shuts off man's many ways and leaves him only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Proverbs 4:18 says, "The path of the just is as the shining light."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The word "path" is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that there is only one path for the just.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God often reveals only one path, and we do not even have the option to ask for another path.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The New Testament shows us that Christ had only one way; there were never two ways for Him to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He only had one way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Why do so many people feel that there are many ways?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They think there are many ways, and they feel that they have to find out which way is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>From among many different ways, they try to find the one that God has prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Actually, the spiritual pathway is never hard to find.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All one needs is a desire to do God's will and walk on His path.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God will spontaneously put His way before him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today many brothers and sisters have many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They receive invitations here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They are putting many ways before them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It seems that God is putting much confidence in them by presenting many ways and allowing them to make their own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Actually, these ones may not be spiritual at all.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There are also some who are waiting for the Lord to open up more ways for them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They have seven or eight ways before them already, yet they are still waiting for God to open up more ways.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>These ones should actually ask God to close up ways so that they can get on God's unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In their initial stage of following the Lord, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had many choices.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But in their old age, they only had one way the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The responsibility for finding the way does not rest on us, but on God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We do not have to frantically seek for the way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All we need to do is to resolve to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God Himself will show us His unique, ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We also have to realize that we do not have the ability to run the race well, just as we did not choose the right way by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God has closed us in, like He closed Noah within the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Only God's protection keeps us in His way.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There was only one pathway throughout Paul's life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He never hesitated on his pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>From the time he met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he had only one way before him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He strove to run this race.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In the end he could say, "I have finished the course" 2 Tim 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The more a Christian grows spiritually, the fewer ways he has.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>At a certain point, he will only have one way the way God has ordained for him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>May the Lord close up the many ways that are before us and keep us on His unique, ordained way.</S>
