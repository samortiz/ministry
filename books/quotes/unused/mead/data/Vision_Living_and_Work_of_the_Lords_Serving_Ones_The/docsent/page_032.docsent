   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Division Issuing In Confusion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Division issues in confusion, and confusion changes the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Bible expositors agree that the woman in Matthew 13 signifies the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the second or third century, the Catholic Church has been an organization outside of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She has changed the church from an organism into an organization, and she has brought mixture into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter 13 says that this woman took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened v. 33 . In the Bible leaven signifies evil things and evil doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The leaven, mixture, in the Catholic Church, such as the worship of saints and relics, was taken from pagan practices.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Protestant denominations have not been delivered from this leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The confusion in Christianity is filled with superstition and different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christianity is full of division; starting a so-called church is as simple as opening a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not condone such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, as a result of the division, there is much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Division and confusion make it impossible for the Lord s desire to be satisfied; thus, there is a need for recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even the so-called ecumenical movement merely produces a superficial unity among Christian denominations and groups; essentially, they are still divided.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee said that this kind of unity is like shaking hands over a fence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not the way to resolve division; neither is it the oneness that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 17 says that God desires that we may be one as the Father and the Son are one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>11, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God does not care for a unity that is outward, superficial, political, or of human maneuvering and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we do not acknowledge the oneness of the ecumenical movement as the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>GOD S PEOPLE NEEDING TO COME</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>OUT OF DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What should our practice be?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord has not commissioned us to build on division or to strengthen division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Old Testament God did not replaster a house that was plagued with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, He commanded that the house be broken down Lev 14:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament God has no intention to improve Babylon, which represents the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, He calls His people to come out of her Rev 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we must not take part in the division in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ENTRUSTED WITH THE TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OF ONENESS IN A LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since we were raised up by the Lord to take His way, we need to return to the proper ground, the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This ground is not based on a particular teaching or a particular person but on the fact of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the Body of Christ is one Eph 4:4 , our standing testifies to the universe, to the unbelievers, and to the devil that we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ground of oneness is the ground of the church, and it is expressed in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is what we refer to as the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ground of locality is based on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How do we practice this oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Due to physical limitations of time and space, we cannot meet with all the believers on the earth at the same time in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has revealed to us from the Bible that there is only one church in one locality; hence, we should meet together with the saints in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the arrangement of God in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not man s idea or man s philosophy; it is the arrangement of God from the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Christians preach the gospel and lead new believers to know the Bible, to know life, and to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, they cannot go further because they have nothing else to say.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In contrast, we go to people with a commission.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our speaking of the truth must be clear and as transparent as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our attitude toward people must not be rude, and our presentation of the truth must be proper and candid; we do not hide anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The truth is the truth, and lies are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, the truth speaks for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We stand on the ground of oneness in our locality; this ground cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many children of God are not standing on this ground; they may even love the Lord more than we do and be more consecrated, more absolute, and more spiritual than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, spirituality is one thing, and the ground is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A brother asked how we can say that we are the Lord s recovery and others are not, when he knows a brother in Christianity who reads the Bible, prays, is spiritual, and has the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must understand that having the Lord s presence does not make us the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that where there are two or three gathered into His name, there He is in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that the Lord s presence is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible says that the Father causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust 5:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the evil can receive sunshine and the unjust are watered by the rain, the children of God can have the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, having the Lord s presence does not mean that you are standing on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must see that standing on the ground of the church and being spiritual are two separate issues.</S>
