AND THE SON OF MAN</h2>
<p>Nathanael referred to the Lord as <em>the Son of God,</em> but the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as <em>the Son of Man.</em> These two titles reveal two aspects of the Lord Jesus for satisfying the need of man and the need of God. We need the Son of God, and God needs the Son of Man. From our perspective, we need God; from God&rsquo;s perspective, He needs man. God needs to enter into man in order to be the Son of Man, but man needs to enter into God in order to be a son of God. The Gospel of John says that, on one hand, the Lord Jesus came, and on the other hand, He went (3:17; 14:3). The Lord Jesus came to bring God into man, and He went to bring man into God. He brought God into man because God needs man, and He brought man into God because man needs God. Man is God&rsquo;s need, and God is man&rsquo;s need. Therefore, God wants to be joined to man and to bring man into Himself so that He and man can become one.</p>
<p>In the four Gospels, even though the Lord Jesus told people to believe that He is the Son of God (John 3:16; 9:35), He always stood in the position of the Son of Man (1:51; 5:27). This is marvelous. When He was tempted in the wilderness, the devil said, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&rdquo; (Matt. 4:3), but He answered, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (v. 4). When He went to Zaccheus&rsquo;s house, He said, &ldquo;The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (Luke 19:10). When He was judged, the high priest charged, &ldquo;Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (Matt. 26:63). He answered, &ldquo;You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (v. 64). Although He wants man to believe in Him as the Son of God, He stands firmly in, holds fast to, and does not leave His position as the Son of Man, because as God, He needs man, and as men, we need God. As God, He needs to enter into man, and as man, we need to enter into God. We need the Son of God, but God needs man.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, God entered into man to be the Son of Man and man enters into God to be sons of God. While the Lord Jesus was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He did not live as the Son of God but as the Son of Man. If He had lived as the Son of God, He would have never become tired, slept, eaten, drunk, or wept. He would have been above all, and He would not have been able to relate to the things in the human life. However, according to the four Gospels, He was not merely the Son of God; He was also the Son of Man. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke speak concerning many aspects of the Lord as a man. Even the Gospel of John, which is concerning the Lord as the God-Savior, says emphatically that the Lord Jesus hungered, thirsted, wept, and washed others&rsquo; feet (4:6-8; 11:35; 13:5). Hence, in the four Gospels He was manifested as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>On one occasion the Lord&rsquo;s divinity could not be concealed, and He was manifested as the Son of God (Matt. 17:2). This can be likened to a cup that is filled with water, which can easily spill over the brim of the cup. When we read the Gospels, we sense that this was the case. Even though the Lord Jesus was outwardly found in fashion as the Son of Man (Phil. 2:8), His inward reality as the Son of God was manifested in Him as a man. The four Gospels show that He was God in man; He was the Son of Man.</p>
<p>God does not want us to be angels in heaven. Consequently, we need to ask whether He wants us to be sons of man or sons of God. If we understand God&rsquo;s salvation and know His way of life, we will see that He wants us, as sons of man, to live as sons of God by the life of God. This can be seen in Galatians 2:20, which says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; We are sons of man, but God wants us to express the life of the Son of God, just as the Son of Man expressed the life of God on the earth. He was the Son of God, but He lived as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the Son of God, but He lived as the Son of Man. This brought God into man. We, the sons of man, should express God as sons of God. This is to bring man into God. The life that the Lord lived on the earth was a testimony of God living in man. We are indeed sons of man, but God wants us to live as sons of God. Such a life testifies that man is in God and that man lives in God. The Lord Jesus is God living in man, and we should be human beings living in God. This is what it means to be a Christian. This is the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not come to be the Messiah, Elijah, the Prophet, or a Rabbi. He came to be a Lamb with a dove in order to bring God into man and to bring man into God, that is, He came as God to live the life of man so that man could live the life of God. In this way, God and man are mingled as one. The result of this mingling is that heaven is opened, and heaven and earth can communicate with each other. This result is signified by the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
