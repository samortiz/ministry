   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Love Being Manifested through the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, we need to see how God's love is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see the work of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is love, and He loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But how does He love man?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Does He show His love by simply patting us on the shoulder and saying, "I love you"?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What would be the use of this kind of love?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have already seen that man is a sinner and that he needs to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But man has no way to save himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since man has no way, God provides the way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have no way, but God's love provides the way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 5:8 says, "God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's love was expressed by Christ coming to this world to die on man's behalf and solve the problem of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man is a sinner and cannot afford to pay the high price that is required to save himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How does God save man?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He put man's sins upon Christ; Christ received God's judgment on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we see Christ's vicarious death on the cross, we know that God's love has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the third revelation in the Bible concerning God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are three great revelations concerning God's love in the Bible: 1 God is love, 2 God loves man, and 3 God's love is manifested through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These three great revelations give us an assessment of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word love results in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because God loves us, He does many things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God did not love us, there would be nothing for Him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose a person does not love anyone; his life will be very ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the minute he loves someone, trouble comes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wants to do many things for the one he loves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because God loves man, He does many things for man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's salvation is based on His love for man; there is no other explanation for God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has saved us because He loves us, not because He owes us some debt or has some moral responsibility to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not have any responsibility to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The salvation that is spoken of in the Bible is based upon love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Love is the only reason, the only motivation, of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God did nothing, no one could say that He was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But because God loves us, He is willing to do a great deal, even having Christ die on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MERCY AND GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now let us consider how God's love is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible shows us that God's love is manifested in two aspects: One is grace, which is positive; the other is mercy, which is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are several verses in the New Testament that put mercy and grace together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Mercy is God's perception of man's present condition; grace is God's saving of man from his present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mercy is God coming to us, whereas grace is God bringing us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mercy is God coming down, whereas grace is God lifting man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mercy is God looking upon man's suffering, whereas grace is God granting man salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose a brother has ragged clothes, ill health, and a poor family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have compassion on him, you will have concern for his ragged clothes, ill health, and poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not grace, because you did not do anything for him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you treat him nicely, provide him with clothes, food, dwelling, and some money, this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Grace is your favor toward him, whereas mercy is your concern toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not enough to have just mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Mercy cannot solve man's problems.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace must come in before one can receive the help.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Mercy is God coming into our midst, whereas grace is God bringing us into His midst.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In His incarnation as a man, God apprehended man's sufferings and bondage to sin, pain, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Christ came to the earth, He spoke mostly of mercy and not much of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The four Gospels rarely mention "grace."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Grace came in only after He died on the cross, when God put man's sins upon Christ and Christ took our sins away.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Epistles frequently speak of grace because God's salvation has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God loves us; His heart is filled with mercy toward our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, He accomplished something for us to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's heart is full of mercy for us this is the best factual basis for asking God to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we pray that God would forgive our sins, what is God's basis for answering our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can say, "O God, I am evil.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I cannot save myself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I cannot even come to You for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the Bible says that You love mercy and not sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>O God, please have mercy on me; forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Both the New Testament and the Old Testament say that God desires "mercy and not sacrifice" Matt 9:13; Hosea 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Mercy is God giving something to man, whereas sacrifice is man giving something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But God says, "I like to give something to you, but I do not like you to give anything to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We cannot perform any good.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if there is some goodness in us, it is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have nothing to depend on; we have nothing to rely upon.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can only depend on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We can count on God's mercy and say, "God, unless You have become a merciless God, I am delighted and happy to seek Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I want to be a person on whom You have mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Grace, however, requires some kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Love is in the heart, mercy is in the feelings, but grace is in the actions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If there is love within but no grace without, nothing much can be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Love is something hidden within, and grace is accomplished without.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When grace is received, it becomes love.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When love is manifested, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What is within is love, and what is acted out is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Grace has two special characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>First, it is generous, and second, it is God doing something for man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the Bible there is God's grace and Christ's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God's grace mainly refers to His generosity, whereas Christ's grace mainly refers to His work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>One verse which we are all familiar with and which is often used by pastors in the denominations for their benedictions is 2 Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why does this verse speak of the love of God, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Can we change it to "the grace of God," "the love of the Lord Jesus Christ," and "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit"?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No, because the characteristic of God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God in heaven is the source of all love.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He is the source of love.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then Christ came to the earth to actually accomplish God's work of love.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He died on the cross; He was crucified by men for the redemption of man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the work of God's love for man, which is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Therefore, God's characteristic is love and Christ's characteristic is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The fellowship of the Spirit is the flowing into us of all that Christ has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The source is God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Following God's love is Christ's work which is His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>God is love and Christ came to manifest this love.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But if it merely stops there, it is still of no benefit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Christ died on Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He died on the cross to accomplish the work of redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But the accomplishment of Christ can only be applied to man through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God's love is the source, Christ's grace is the operation of God's love, and the Spirit's fellowship channels this work of Christ to man.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Spirit changes the objective things of Christ into subjective experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He wroughts that which is outside of man into man.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is why 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>An illustration of this can be found in the hospital where a doctor gives a prescription, a pharmacist dispenses the medicine, and the nurse ultimately delivers the medicine to the patient.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If you only know the kind of medicine you need without having anyone deliver it to you, the medicine cannot get into your body.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You need to have all three before the medicine can take effect.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Hence, 2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Grace is what Christ does.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If it is something we do, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If you earn money for your living, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Suppose I am a beggar, and others give me something to eat this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Since grace is Christ's work, it is generous.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In the Bible grace has three qualities.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We can describe them in business terms.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The first quality of grace is that it is not a purchase; it is not even a fair exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It is not something that is worth a few dollars and that is bought for a few dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Second, grace is not cheap; it is not like an item that is worth two dollars but is sold for one dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Third, grace is not loaned; it is not something which you receive that must be repaid later.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Grace cannot be purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If we have to do something before we can come before God to be saved, this salvation is not based on grace.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Grace does not use our good work as the basis for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Grace is given to us freely.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Therefore, the Bible says we are saved by grace, not by works Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Grace is freely given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Grace is not cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Grace is not something that we can bargain for at a low price.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>It is not that we work a little and Christ supplements the rest, as if Christ were some kind of collateral.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>If we had to do something first and then trust in the Lord for what we could not do, our salvation would be nothing more than shopping for a bargain, because we would be paying a certain amount first and then relying on Christ to pay the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>No, grace is absolutely not a bargain purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>None of us can afford to pay even the slightest amount of the price.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Grace is entirely the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Third, grace is not a loan.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Many people say that grace is necessary for salvation, but that Christ will reclaim His salvation if we do not produce good deeds after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>This is like saying that grace has been loaned to us, and that it needs to be repaid.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Grace is forever the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>It is totally and freely given.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>There is no need for us to ever repay anything.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Now let us read some more verses.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If this is God's word, you have to believe it; if it is my word, you can ignore it.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Please read Romans 3:23-27.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>This is the most difficult passage in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Man has a big problem: He is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>If God did not love us, nothing would happen even though man is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Since man sins, God could let man perish, and there would be nothing that God would have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>But God has two big problems.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>First, man has sins, and second, God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Satisfying the demands of these two items requires God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>In order for God to satisfy His love toward man, He must first solve the problem of man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Because man has sinned and because God loves man, there is the need of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>The initiation or motivation of grace is God's love for man, while the necessity of grace is due to man's sins.</S>
