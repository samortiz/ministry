   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 The Temple Being the House Palace of God the Father, the King of Kings, and His Many Sons, the Co-kings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The temple is the house palace of God the Father, who is the King of kings, and of His household, His many sons, His royal family, who are the co-kings with the Father to be its reign Rev 22:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These co-kings are also the priests who serve God v. 3b . Hence, they are the royal priesthood, the kingly priesthood 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the Dweller and His children will be kings, this temple becomes a palace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Solomon built a temple for God and also a palace for himself separately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two buildings were separate and divided, but now in the New Jerusalem our temple and our palace are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s temple is our palace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the members of the same divine family live in that temple where they worship God and live as kings, making that living place a palace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father is the Father-King, and the children are the children-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reigning and ruling royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their dwelling place is not only the place for them to serve God but also a palace for them to live as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There has never been such a family on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Japanese have their emperors, and the British have their kings, but there has never been a situation where every member of a family is a king.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We believers in Christ who are washed by the blood and regenerated by the Spirit are the children of God who will eventually become kings Rev 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Father-King is the unique Father, but He will have millions of co-rulers, or co-regents, because we will all be His co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 5:17 says that by the abundance of grace we can reign in life as a king today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The entire Bible tells us that we, the children of God, eventually will be the children-kings in the King s house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reign in the holy city will be not only God Himself as the Father-King but also His children as the co-kings with their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4 The Temple Being the Holy of Holies and</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Enlargement of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word for temple in Revelation 21:22, naos, does not denote the whole temple in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, it denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This inner temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, signifying that God and the Lamb will be the place in which we serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, the measurement of the New Jerusalem is the same in length, breadth, and height.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In three dimensions the city measures twelve thousand stadia v. 16 . The principle revealed in the Bible is that a building with three equal dimensions indicates the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was ten cubits in three dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy of Holies in the temple according to 1 Kings 6:20 was also three equal dimensions of twenty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Accordingly, the New Jerusalem, the holy city, must also be the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The entire city of New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies, and God and the Lamb are the temple of this city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we put these two points together, we will realize that this city is God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the whole city is the Holy of Holies and because the inner temple is God and the Lamb, the city itself is God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the whole city is called the tabernacle Rev 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as a boy is the precursor of a man, so also the tabernacle is the precursor of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the temple appears, there is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when the tabernacle comes into its fullness, it becomes the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we need to keep three points before us: that the whole city is the Holy of Holies, that the temple is God Himself and the Lamb, and that the whole city is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we put all these points together, we see that God Himself is the whole city of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The entire city of New Jerusalem is not only God Himself but also a living composition of all God s redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, God is the entire city; on the other hand, the city is a living composition of the redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Similarly, the church today is Christ, and it is also a composition of all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, the church is a composition of all the believers; on the other hand, Christ is both the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, 1 Corinthians 12:12 indicates that Christ is not only the Head but also the Body: Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The principle is the same in both the church and New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is also the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ Himself is the individual Christ, but the church is the corporate Christ, Christ enlarged and expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the church is Christ s expansion, His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In like manner, the New Jerusalem is the enlargement and the expansion of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should desire to dwell in God, even in the enlargement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The expansion and the enlargement of God will be our eternal city in which we will dwell for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we come to the New Jerusalem, we are told that it is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John then says that the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we can see that the city is not only the tabernacle but also the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the tabernacle, the city is the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the temple, the city is the enlargement of God Himself and the Lamb.</S>
