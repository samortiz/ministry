Lord, open up this mysterious book to all of us. Grant us, Lord, the understanding. Grant us also the inner seeing. Lord, we trust in You. Sustain us and maintain us to the end. Amen.<p>The subject of these messages is the application of the interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the seeking believers. The burden for the messages in this book can be expressed in the following four statements:<p>1.The New Jerusalem is the greatest and the ultimate sign in the Scriptures, signifying an organic constitution of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect.<p>2.Its base is pure gold, signifying the divine nature of God; it is the solid foundation of its throne for the divine administration, which is the glorious center from which proceeds the divine and human communication, signified by its street, to reach all its twelve gates.<p>3.Its gates are pearls, signifying the issue of the secretion of Christ&#8217;s redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection.<p>4.Its wall and its foundations are precious stones, consummated by the Spirit through His transforming and building work.<p>In the past we released many messages to interpret this section of the Word on the mystery of the New Jerusalem. Thus, there is no need for us to repeat any past interpretation. We want to go on to apply to ourselves what has already been interpreted. In this first message, we want to see and enter into the application of the significance and the base of the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>I. ITS SIGNIFICANCE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The New Jerusalem Being the Greatest and the Ultimate Sign in the Scriptures</h2><p>Revelation 1:1 says that the Lord Jesus sent His angel to John to make His revelation known by signs, so the New Jerusalem is the greatest and the ultimate sign in the Scriptures (21:2, 9-10). A sign is a symbol with spiritual significance.<h2 class=head2>B. Signifying an Organic Constitution of the Processed Triune God Mingled with His Regenerated, Transformed, and Glorified Tripartite Elect</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city, but this city is not literally physical. It is a sign, a figure, signifying an organic constitution. It is not something organized, but something constituted organically. The holy city is a constitution in life of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect. It is an organic constitution of two parties: God and man. The first party is divine. The second party is human.<h2 class=head3>1. The Tabernacle of God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem has two natures, humanity and divinity. According to its humanity, the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God among men-the dwelling place of God in His humanity among men on the earth (Rev. 21:3). In the Bible, the tabernacle is a human dwelling place. The New Jerusalem is a human dwelling place because it is constituted with humanity. It is God&#8217;s human dwelling place on earth. John 1:14 says that God was incarnated in the flesh to tabernacle among men. He is God, but He has become a man. He partook of humanity as His nature, so He dwells in humanity.<h2 class=head3>2. The Temple of God</h2><p>According to its divinity, the New Jerusalem is the temple of God as the dwelling place of His redeemed elect (Rev. 21:22). The holy city is the temple of God because it is divine. It is the temple of God, yet it is the dwelling place of His redeemed. How could this be? Because this is God&#8217;s temple, the dweller must be divine, but what about us? Are we divine or human? According to its humanity, the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle, but God dwells in the tabernacle. God can dwell in a human dwelling place because He has become a man. According to the divinity of the New Jerusalem, it is a temple for God to dwell in. If you are only human and not divine, you cannot dwell in the temple. We human beings can dwell in a divine temple because we have been made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. The New Jerusalem is a mutual abode. According to its humanity, it is a human tabernacle. According to its divinity, it is a divine temple. It is a human dwelling place, but the Dweller is God. How can God dwell in a human place? Because He became a man. In the same way, how can we humans dwell in God&#8217;s temple? Because we have been made God. This is the mutual abiding of God and man.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
