Therefore, Smyrna depicts the second era of the church on earth. Although we cannot say definitely that the ten days of tribulation refer to the ten great persecutions of the Roman Caesars, yet they must at least hint at the tribulations of the day. We cannot say definitely that the great persecutions are ten in number. However, the time when the Roman Caesars persecuted the church was very near the time of Smyrna-from the time Domitian ruled until the end of Diocletian's reign was over two hundred years. The age of Smyrna ended approximately A.D. 313. During that period, we have the age of persecution for the church. Although the church suffered greater persecutions in other ages in addition, they were limited to one region only and were not wide-spread. The greatness of the Roman Empire enhanced its power to persecute the Christians and left no place of escape for the believers.</P><P>After reading Foxe's Book of Martyrs, we in the twentieth century cannot help but be baffled. The sufferings that the believers went through at that time were those that no human flesh can withstand. The tortures we see in our history cannot be compared with one-tenth of the cruelty of the punishments these ones experienced in those days. The method of persecutions and the steps of torture for the criminals then was a great invention of the day! Ways so cruel as to surpass the human imagination were used and were applied to the saints. This makes us wonder what extremities Antichrist will use to persecute the Christians during the great tribulation! Surely they will be more severe and more unbearable. What a pity for those who will not give up the world now but who will try to no avail in that day when suffering comes! Now is the time for us to overcome. It is most pitiful that believers have to pass through God's severe chastisement before they will give up the world!</P><P>When we consider the faithfulness of the martyrs of the day, we cannot help but aspire after them. Many believers aspired and even craved to die for the Lord. Some believers had to suffer tortures for a few months before they died. Under such extreme pain, they had no complaints. On the contrary, they endured joyfully, bearing excellent testimony for the Lord. Although they could gain their lives by one word of denial, they refused to do it. When we read of the severity of their trials, we cannot imagine ourselves being put in the same trials and being as faithful as they were. Some sisters had their parents pleading, their lovers imploring, their relatives persuading, and their children wailing before them. They were placed before the wild beasts and subjected to hunger. Yet they were not moved in their hearts at all and did not give in a bit. They would rather be shredded into pieces and wasted in tortures than to deny the name of the Lord they loved. The world could go away. Lovers could go away. Their children and their lives could go away. Yet they would not give up the Lord Jesus. John's disciple Polycarp was one of the elders of Ephesus. At the age of eighty-six, he was taken away by the Roman government and was promised release if he would blaspheme the Lord Jesus. His answer was a timeless motto: "I have served Him for eighty-six years. He has never forsaken me. How can I forsake Him merely for the sake of preventing my death?"</P><P>However, the blood of the saints is the seed of the truth. Many times, the Roman soldiers who did the torturing with jesting saw the endurance, joy, love, forgiveness, courage in facing death, and faithfulness in purpose of the saints in tribulations, and they were moved with curiosity. Out of curiosity they investigated and were greatly moved by the Holy Spirit. As a result, many times, while the saints were being burned in flames, and while the ashes were still falling, the torturer picked up the same faith and stepped in to suffer the same punishment. The Lord's cross draws man to it (John 12), in like manner does the saints' cross draw men to the Lord's cross. This influence is not regional, nor accidental. One famous historian noted that if all the Christians at that time were removed from the great Roman Empire, the population of the Empire would be greatly reduced. This shows us that though the force of persecution was great at that time, the power of the saints' salvation was also great. Many hardened hearts cannot be penetrated through by anything else except by the blood. The Savior has shed His blood already. Those who preach His shedding of the blood should themselves also shed blood.</P><P>However, although the tribulations of the day turned the saints to a greater love for the Lord, these tribulations did not make the ordinances and teachings of the church pure. It is true that the church was very faithful in opposing many heresies already. This is to be commended. However, the Judaistic teaching originated much earlier, and we have no way to find out its way of propagation or the names of its proponents. When we turn to the world histories which are void of God's inspiration, we see that changes were brought in early on. Yet there was no record as to how things were being changed. Moreover, because the Judaistic practices and works were so prevailing already, it is difficult for us to place the age of this epistle to be at the time of Rome's persecution of the church. It is hard for us to believe that such a faithful and suffering church would succumb to the Judaistic teachings. The fact of the matter is this: history concerning the early church was already rare from the start. Those histories that were written passed through many centuries during which the truth was rejected. Considering this, can we hope to find in them any record of the struggle of the Judaistic teachers? Since it was the practice then and in subsequent ages to attach prominent names to the authorship of fabricated works, it is hard to imagine that there were no alterations in early church history to the record of the struggle with the Judaistic teachers. The Judaistic teaching was necessarily very prevailing at that time. However, church history must contain the record of the church's struggle with it. Moreover, the Lord's word here (Rev. 2:9) causes us to believe that there were struggles at that time. We do believe in one thing: that we have to wait until a future time before a true account of church history will appear. Perhaps now it is only recorded before God. Nevertheless, we know that the Nazarenes and the Ebionites were Judaistic religions of the day. Their source, existence, and end were recorded clearly in Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The change in church organization and its deviation from the scriptural principles were also a result of the influence of this teaching. Another proof is that the first fifteen overseers of Jerusalem were all circumcised Jews, and the congregation there all kept both the law of Moses and the teachings of Christ as well.</P><P>If we consider these ones who called themselves Jews to be the Jews in the flesh, we can see that it is also a fact that they persecuted the Christians. Even while Polycarp was being burned, the Jews were busily helping to prepare the stakes.</P><P>We have seen the rising tide of the Judaistic teaching. What we have to do is to lift God's gospel of grace up high, and reject those who mix the law with grace. We must not take upon ourselves the heavy yoke of the law and give up our freedom in Christ. If we keep the law, it will not save us. Moreover, it will not increase our standing before God one bit. On the contrary, we will fall from grace. We are here to obey Christ, and not the law.</P><P>We have also seen how the saints suffered for the Lord. Because they had left their first love, they were chastised by God. We must not wait until the great tribulation comes, when God chastises us, to give up everything to follow the Lord. God has prepared everything on the cross for us to overcome through the Lord. If we do not receive God's grace now, we will receive His stripes in the future. If it pleases God that we suffer for Him, then for His love's sake, we should be faithful unto death to glorify His name. Other saints have suffered. How can we barter for ease? Suffering is the pathway to glory. May we be faithful and watchful together in the way ahead of us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
