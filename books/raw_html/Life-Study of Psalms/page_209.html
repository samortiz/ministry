<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. There Being Four Items</H2><P>Verse 13b shows us that there are four items among the spoil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Dove Wings</H2><P>The dove wings signify the moving power of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) White Silver</H2><P>The dove wings are covered with white silver. Silver signifies Christ in His redemption for our justification, which is indicated by the color white, the color of approval.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Pinions</H2><P>The pinions are feathers at the end of a bird's wings. The pinions give a bird the strength to fly and to soar. Hence, in verse 13b "its pinions" signify the soaring power of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) Greenish Yellow, Glittering Gold</H2><P>The greenish yellow, glittering gold with which the pinions are covered signifies God's nature glittering in the divine life and glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>5) The Contents of the Four Items<br>Actually Being the Triune God with All the Items<br>of His Complete, Full, and All-inclusive Salvation</H2><P>The contents of the above four items, as Christ's spoil in His victory for the enjoyment of God's elect, are actually the Triune God with all the items of His complete, full, and all-inclusive salvation. "Dove" signifies the Spirit with His moving and soaring power; "white silver" signifies Christ in His all-inclusive redemption for His believers' justification as the entrance into His full salvation; and "greenish yellow gold" signifies God in His nature glittering in His life and glory. Both Christ and God are brought in by the Spirit's power: Christ by the Spirit's moving power and God by the Spirit's soaring power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>6) God's Elect Enjoying<br>These Items as Their Portion in Christ<br>and Announcing Them to Others as the Glad Tidings</H2><P>Verse 11 indicates that God's elect enjoy all the above items as their portion in Christ and announce them to others as the glad tidings. On the one hand, we are the great host of women bearing, preaching, the glad tidings. On the other hand, we are restfully enjoying our portion in Christ, enjoying the Triune God&#151;the Spirit as the dove, Christ the Son as the silver, and God the Father as the gold. The Spirit as the dove moves with Christ as the silver and with God as the gold. While we are preaching the glad tidings, we are enjoying the Triune God as the spoil gained for us by Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ Leading Those Taken Captive</H2><P>Verse 18b says, "You have led captive those taken captive." Here "those taken captive" refers to the believers of Christ. Before we were saved, we were sinners and enemies of God, and we had been taken captive by Satan and imprisoned. We were "those taken captive." But Christ defeated Satan and captured his captives, including us. Then, like a general leading his captives, Christ in His ascension to the heavens led us to the Father.</P>
