   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in this message is not to share about the mystery; it is to have fellowship with you concerning the experience of the Christ who is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the center of all mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, such a Christ can be experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Philippians 1:19-26, for example, we see some mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first of these mysteries is found in verse 19: "For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>. This Spirit is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why does Paul here speak of the Spirit of Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does he not call this Spirit the Spirit of God or the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No doubt, the Spirit here refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the only time in the entire Bible that the Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Acts 16:7 we have the Spirit of Jesus Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>, and in Romans 8:9, the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in this verse we do not have merely the Spirit of Jesus nor the Spirit of Christ, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a mystery, for we cannot adequately understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CHRIST MAGNIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A second mystery is found in verse 20: "According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We see here that no matter what was to happen to him, Paul's desire was that Christ would be magnified in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What does it mean for Christ to be magnified?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Does it mean that Christ is made greater?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is already great.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Does He then need to be enlarged?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ephesians we are told that Christ fills all in all 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How great He is!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many years ago some astronomers said that two hundred forty million solar systems form a galaxy and that forty billion galaxies form the unique center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, the Bible says that Christ fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Christ is so great, He still needs to be magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 21 Paul said, "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 23 Paul said that his desire was to depart to be with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In one verse Paul said that for him to live is Christ, but in another verse he said that he wanted to depart and be with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time was Christ present with Paul, or was He absent from Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ surely was present with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why then did Paul still expect to be with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The experience of Christ is altogether a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>OUR CHRISTIAN LIVING BEING A MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more mysterious we are, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, this mystery must be our living, not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our Christian living is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our Christian love and humility are also mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The humility taught by Confucius was not a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when we Christians live out humility, this humility is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever we live out from within us should be mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regarding our humility, others should say, "We cannot explain the kind of life this person lives.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although he is humble, his humility is different from that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His love is also different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that he doesn't love anyone, but actually he loves others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His love is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There seems to be no limit to his love."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although human love is limited, the proper love lived out by a Christian is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Often I have heard people say, "I simply cannot tolerate this any more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This situation has exhausted my patience."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If our patience can be exhausted, that indicates that it is not the patience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We Christians need to live out a patience that is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more the circumstances exhaust our patience, the more patient we are, for our patience is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It causes others to wonder how we can be so patient.</S>
