   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Crucifying Their Flesh with the Passions and the Lusts</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Galatians 5:24 says, "They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"They who are of Christ Jesus" refers to those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, they belong to Christ and are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As saved ones, we are now of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Paul's word, those who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The crucifixion of the old man in Romans 6:6 was not accomplished by us, but here it says that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The old man is our being; the flesh is the expression of our being in our practical living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The crucifixion of our old man is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross, whereas the crucifixion of our flesh with its passions and lusts is our practical experience of that fact.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the crucifixion of Christ we have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This enables us to crucify our flesh with the passions and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, we have been crucified with Christ so that we may be able to crucify our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our crucifying the flesh is based on the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need a clear understanding concerning the old man and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need for us to deal with the old man, for the old man has already been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, day by day we need to crucify our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problems in our daily living do not come from the old man but from the flesh with its passions and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, based upon the fact that our old man has already been dealt with through the death of Christ, we must go on to crucify our flesh in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is crucial to see the difference between Romans 6:6 and Galatians 5:24.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 5:24 Paul does not say that those who are Christ's have crucified the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He says that they have crucified the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is impossible to commit suicide by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, it is not possible for us to crucify our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we cannot crucify the old man, we can crucify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The crucifixion of the old man had to be accomplished by someone else, but the crucifixion of the flesh must be carried out by us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In speaking of the crucifixion of the flesh Paul uses the perfect tense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He says not that we are crucifying the flesh, nor that we shall crucify it, but that we have crucified it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He speaks of this as if it were an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning the crucifixion, there are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first is that when Christ was crucified, He crucified our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The other aspect is that we have crucified our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Based upon the fact that Christ has crucified the old man, we have crucified the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the second fact, our crucifixion of the flesh, is the application of the first fact, Christ's crucifixion of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our experience we need to apply Christ's crucifixion to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul's use of the perfect tense to describe this indicates that such should be the normal experience of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All believers should be those who have applied Christ's crucifixion to their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As those who belong to Christ, who have been put into Christ, we have done this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here Paul is speaking according to the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have never crucified our flesh, our experience is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our experience is normal, then we who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh. a By the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is by the Spirit Gal 5:16 that we crucify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cross of Christ gives us the standing, or the basis, to deal with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our whole being the entire fallen tripartite man was crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only do we have this base objectively, but we have the Spirit subjectively to enable us to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to walk by the Spirit, we must apply Christ's crucifixion to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we apply the cross to our flesh by the indwelling Spirit, our flesh will be nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is to crucify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the flesh is on the cross, only the Spirit remains, and we experience the Spirit as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Experiencing the Spirit in this way, we walk by the Spirit and are led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we experience the Spirit in this way, the more we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
