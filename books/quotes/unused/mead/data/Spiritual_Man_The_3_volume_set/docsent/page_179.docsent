   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thus, as our biblical knowledge increases and our spiritual experiences grow, the standard of our conduct will also rise accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the gradual increase of light, our conduct must become gradually more holy for our conscience to be preserved without offense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we have another year of knowledge and experience, our conscience will accuse us if our conduct is the same as the previous year's. In the previous year God did not cut off His fellowship with us, because we were ignorant of our transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But once we have knowledge of the same transgressions, the fellowship with God will be lost if we do not renounce them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The conscience is given by God to the believers to be the present standard of their holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a believer violates the standard, they will be considered as having sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord still has many things to speak to us, but because of the immaturity of our spiritual understanding, He still has to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God deals with His children according to their individual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some matters are considered to be extremely evil and sinful by some believers, yet others may not feel the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is due to differences in the knowledge of their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, let us not criticize one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only the Father God knows how to deal with His children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He certainly does not expect to see His "little children" have the strength of the "young men," or His "young men" to have the experiences of the "fathers."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, He expects all of His children to submit to Him according to what they already know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we know with certainty this is not easy that God has already spoken to our brother's conscience concerning a certain matter, and he does not obey, then we can urge him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we must never force our brother to follow the feeling of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the absolutely holy God did not reject us because of past wrongdoings which we were ignorant about, then how can we, according to our present level, judge our brother who only possesses the knowledge which we had last year?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, if we are helping others, we do not have to compel them again and again to obey every minor point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We only have to beseech them to walk fully according to the guidance of their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they have surrendered to God, then whenever the Holy Spirit enlightens them on any of the things clearly recorded in the Bible, they will obey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the will has been surrendered, then any time the conscience receives light, a believer will walk according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the same for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not have to extend ourselves to use the strength of the soul to understand many truths for which the right time has not come.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as we are willing to hear the present speaking of God, this is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Holy Spirit wishes to lead us in our intuition to examine some truths, we should not hesitate to comply; otherwise, we would lower our own standard of holiness and become complacent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In short, if we are willing to move according to our spirit, there will be no problem at all.</S>
