He was put into prison for preaching it to the Roman emperor. He was severely beaten. The Roman soldiers forced him to put his hands to the fire. They forced him to dip his fingers in burning oil and to put it between his legs. They also scorched his skin with a red hot iron. In the end he was thrown to the beasts and eaten. Before he went to Rome, he knew that he was going to die, and he wrote a letter to Polycarp, saying, "Before I reach Rome, I must fight with the beasts and be bound and led to the cruel ones. The better I treat them, the more cruel they will treat me. Day by day I am beaten severely by them. How I yearn to see the mouth of the beasts and to find death coming upon me soon. Here I am learning to look beyond the seen to the unseen. I only desire to gain Christ. I am willing to see my body torn to pieces and the pain of the lion's claw and the beastly scourge come upon me, if I can only know Christ and gain Him."</p><h2 class="head2">Polycarp</h2><p>Polycarp was the bishop of Smyrna. When he was eighty-six years old, persecutors sought after him, but he escaped. One night in a dream, he saw his bed on fire, and he knew that he was going to be martyred for the Lord. When his captors came for him, they were amazed at the calmness and peace on his face. He asked that he be given an hour to pray. Although his captors somewhat repented of their actions, they still handed him to the governor and prepared for his burning at the stake outside the city. Realizing that he was advanced in age, they were somewhat hesitant to put him to death. They promised that they would let him go if he would only deny Jesus. But he said, "I cannot deny Him. Eighty-six years the Lord has never changed His grace; He has never done me any wrong. How can I deny Him?" The men lit the fire while he continued to praise God in its midst. The soldiers pierced his side and much blood came out. After his lower body was burnt, he could still speak, and he said, "Thank God that I can have the opportunity to testify today with my life." Twelve believers were burned alive together with him. He was indeed a person who knew the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Perpetua</h2><p>Perpetua was twenty-six years old when she was martyred. She was well educated, and her family was very rich. When she was caught, she had a child with her. Her father loved her very much and went to prison to persuade her to give up her faith. She was strong in faith, however, and was not moved. Her father became angry and said he would no longer come to see her. When she was brought before the magistrate, she was ordered to offer a sacrifice to the idols. She refused and was sent to the cellars. Two stewards taking care of jailed believers tried their best to allow her to devote some of her rest times to nurse her child. She realized that she did not have long to live, and she committed her child to her own mother. Later her father could not stand the thought of her suffering and came to persuade her again, gently and with much pleading. She knew clearly that she had to give up everything for Christ, so she told her father, "May God's will be done." The judge asked her to seriously consider her father's tears, her child's need, and her own life's perils. She overcame all natural affection, ignored all sufferings in the mind and the flesh, and readily sacrificed all human love for Christ. For His sake, she waited quietly for her time of execution. A sister among the convicted called Felicitas was equally ready to give up her life. She gave birth to a daughter while in prison and committed the baby to another sister's care. Later the two sisters were taken to the beasts together. After almost bleeding to death, they were pierced by executioners with swords to end their lives. This happened in March of A.D. 205. Countless people were martyred about the same time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> </body></html>
