   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED OF A CLEAR VISION OF LIFE IN ROMANS 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you receive a clear vision of life from Romans 8, you are in the experience and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was a young Christian, I read the Bible many times, and I tried to discover how to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, I realized that the answer is implied in all the different items of the divine theology in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason I have presented the experience of life and the growth in life as I have done in these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our need is to see a vision of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As you read these items of the divine theology again and again, one day you will be enlightened to see clearly how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have learned the theology of the recovery, but our need is for this theology to become our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you have a vision, there is no need to merely recite these things; rather, you can just point out to people what you see of the divine scenery according to the divine view.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To give a message on the matter of life is very, very hard because life is a spontaneous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose there is a little tree growing in front of me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I do not touch it, it really grows, but when I touch it, the growth is bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It may be better not to touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the same when I fellowship with you concerning the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I encourage you to experience life, you may not experience life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To experience life is like switching on electricity which has been installed in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you need electricity to go to a lamp, you simply go to the switch, turn it on, and the light comes on.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you turn the switch off, the electricity stops, and the lamp no longer has any light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your experience of life is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you sense that the light has been turned off, you need to pray, but your prayer may also be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you pray, "Lord, set my mind on the spirit," this prayer may not work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should pray by allowing the interceding Spirit within you to pray by groaning Rom 8:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this kind of prayer, the switch is turned on again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before we came into the Lord's recovery, we might not have had any knowledge concerning the switch of the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes we accidently turned the switch on and just as quickly turned it off again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, however, in the Lord's recovery, we are not in that much darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have realized that Christ is the Spirit in our spirit and that this Christ is the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He is here, life is here.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now, we have to live according to this life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just to know this much will turn the switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our problem is that we do not remain here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to come back and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our prayer, it is better not to say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should simply groan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Soon the switch is turned on again, and we are also happy again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 8 shows us a heavenly vision with view after view.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nearly every verse is a view.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 2 is a view to show you how the consummated Triune God today is life to you, and this life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 10 shows you another view of the consummated Triune God as Christ in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now, your spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 6 presents another view concerning the mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then verse 11 presents the view that the Spirit of life as the processed Triune God indwells you to give life to your body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You then become a person of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are life in your spirit, you are life in your mind, your soul, and you are life in your body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once you see all these views, you then need to apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether you are about to die or live depends upon whether you live according to the flesh or according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must learn not to live according to the old man, the flesh, but to live according to the spirit, the new man.</S>
