THE LADDER SET UP ON THE EARTH<br />AND REACHING TO HEAVEN TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE WAY FOR THE COMMUNICATION<br />BETWEEN GOD&rsquo;S ELECT ON THE EARTH<br />AND THEIR GOD IN HEAVEN</h2><p>Genesis 28 shows us that Jacob was forced to leave his home and family, and from Beersheba he went toward Padan-aram. He came into a situation where he was lonely and helpless. Because the sun had set, he took a stone and made it his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep. In his dream he saw a ladder set up on the earth with its top reaching to heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending on it (vv. 10-12). The dream that Jacob had was fulfilled in the New Testament, in John 1:51, where the Lord Jesus said to Nathanael, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; The Son of Man here is the ladder in Genesis 28:12. This reveals that the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven which Jacob saw in his dream typifies Christ as the way for the communication between God&rsquo;s elect on the earth and their God in heaven. Through Christ as the heavenly ladder, the living way (John 14:6), God and we, we and God, can have contact and communication with one another.</p>
