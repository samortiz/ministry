<h2 class="head2">Sinful Establishments</h2><p>Sixth, when the Lord comes back, He will deal with all the establishments that induce man to sin. On the one hand, man sins because he has a sinful nature within him. On the other hand, he sins because there are many sinful places in this world. Such places as brothels, opium dens, cinemas, and dance halls encourage man to sin. In the cities one finds more rich people and correspondingly more sinful establishments. Matthew 13:41 says that when the Son of Man comes, He will send His angels to pick out from His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and all the wicked ones and cast them into the furnace. Today there are all kinds of means and places that induce man to sin. When the Lord comes again, they will all be cast into the fire. We believe that when the Lord comes back, He will do this.</p><h2 class="head2">The Suffering of All Creation</h2><p>Seventh, when the Lord comes back, the entire creation will be redeemed. Some living creatures are suffering today on account of man's fall. Many kinds of animals, whether higher or lower, are suffering and oppressed in this world. It is impossible for tigers and man to coexist in peace. It is likewise impossible for lions and human beings to cohabit together. In the old days animals were even more abused than they are now. The same can be said of house pets and domesticated animals. They are all sighing and suffering, waiting for the day of redemption to come (Rom. 8:21-22). When the Lord comes back again, the sighing of the whole creation will cease. Isaiah 11:6 and 9 say that the wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling will be together, and a young boy shall lead them. They will not hurt nor destroy anyone or anything. That will indeed be a grand release and great deliverance of the whole universe.</p><h2 class="head2">Earthly Governments</h2><p>Eighth, when the Lord comes again, all earthly governments will cease. Today is the day when man reigns. But no one can be just and righteous. This is the reason many people are oppressed. Revelation 11:15 says that one day all the nations of the earth will become the kingdom of our Lord and His Christ. Then no government will oppress its people. Then the earth will be filled with righteousness and justice. Without the second coming of the Lord, salvation will not be complete. Day by day as we observe the injustice, unrighteousness, and oppression of the weak by the strong, the small by the great, and all other such things in the world around us, we believe even more firmly that the Lord will come back again. Once He comes, all these negative things will be done away.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE AND RESPONSIBILITY<br />TOWARD THE WORLD</h2><p>The Lord's coming is our hope of glory. In the course of our waiting for His return, we should have a proper kind of living and a proper waiting attitude. There are many unbelievers in this world, and we have to know that we can never join them in their kind of gospel. Man's basic need is life, not material or psychological satisfaction. Salvation is the fundamental guiding principle of a believer. We cannot allow unsaved persons in this world to do gospel work. Their so-called social gospel is not a gospel at all. They have rejected the Lord's redemption altogether. Our preaching of the gospel results in men being saved, not in the problems of society being solved. We are commissioned by the Lord to save every lost soul. Today as proper human beings, we can do our best to help others. But we have to know that we are limited. Our main work on earth is to bring men to God.</p><p>Before the Lord became flesh, that is, before His first coming, everyone was a sinner living in a sinful world. After the Lord's first coming, all the believers became righteous men living in a sinful world. When He comes again, we will be righteous men living in a righteous world. We have to show the new ones that while we are living on this earth, we have to fulfill our duty as a Christian; we have to help to save more men. This is our only hope. Other problems will be solved when the Lord comes back again. All the signs and signals of this world point to the soon approach of the day of the Lord, and for this we have to watch and wait.</p>
