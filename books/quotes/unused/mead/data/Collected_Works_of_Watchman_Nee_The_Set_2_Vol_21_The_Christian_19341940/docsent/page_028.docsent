   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God wants us to do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, He shows us that we are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The worst thing that can happen to a patient is to avoid the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But unless a sick person admits that he is sick, he will not consult a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, we have to go see the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is also very important.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose I have a friend who has tuberculosis but does not admit it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He argues that he is tall and strong and big, and that he is not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would advise him, saying, "You have a slight fever every day, and your health is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should rest more and work less.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, it would be hard to recuperate and be healed if your illness progresses to the second stage."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But this friend of mine does not admit that he is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He argues: "Am I not well?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do I not have the strength to work?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He still goes to bed late and rises up early, and lives as he pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It does not mean that he is well; he is merely denying his own illness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As such he can never be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the way God treats the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It does not mean that God does not have the way, the means, or the salvation ready.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The trouble is that man does not realize that he is sick and that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why it takes God two stages to enlighten man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1 says that the law was first given by Moses, and then grace and reality came through Jesus Christ v. 17 . God took four thousand years to show man that he is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God gave the law to man in order that he would see that he is a sinner, and that all men are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God did not give the law for man to keep, but for man to realize that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The purpose of the law is for man to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law cannot justify man, nor can it save man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The book of Romans makes this point very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It says that "through the law is the clear knowledge of sin" 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After we have the clear knowledge of sin, the Lord Jesus comes and says, "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the first stage, God gave the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the second stage, God gave us the Lord Jesus grace came.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a doctor diagnoses a patient, the first thing he does is to ask the patient to stick out his tongue, feel the patient's pulse, and measure his temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will show the patient that he is sick and then tell him the kind of sickness that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he gives the patient a packet or a bottle of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, the doctor shows the patient that he is sick, and then he tells the patient the way and method to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the work in the second stage must be related to the work in the first stage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, God gave the law so that man would realize that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, God sent grace, which is the Lord Jesus, so that man would be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But there are some stiff-necked ones who say that they are not sick, and that they do not have any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So the Lord Jesus said that He had not come to call the righteous those who consider themselves righteous .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let the others keep the law and be Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now that the Lord Jesus has come, He is telling us that a man must receive help in the first stage and then receive help in the second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet some men are not willing to receive the testimony of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man refuses to receive help from the law, he will not receive help from grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man does not receive help in the first instance, he will not receive help in the second.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I may think that I am healthy, and I may stand tall.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But after the doctor measures my pulse and temperature and examines me, he will tell me that I am sick.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I may think that I am a good man, but now that the law has come, it tells me that I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I may think that I am a wonderful man, but once the law comes, it will tell me that I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This leaves me helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the second man comes; He helps me and saves me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The law can only define a sick man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The commission of the law is to show man that he is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you do not admit that you are sick, you must submit to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A healthy person does not need a doctor; only a sick person needs a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a great and universal principle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Friends, are you sick at heart?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do you have any hidden illness?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you have any secret sins that no one can touch?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you have sins that you have committed in darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you have some illness that cannot be told to others?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God will touch your secret and hidden illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a pity that, although man knows very well that he is naked and laid bare in God's eyes, and that he has a part in all kinds of unclean evils and human sins, he still tries to hide himself and mend himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He still tries to improve his conduct a little before believing in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It seems as if he is trying to recuperate a little before going to the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you do not admit honestly that you are a sinner, you cannot be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I like the song we sang today.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It says, "Just as I am...I come!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I come!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hymns, #1048 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have told you before that this hymn was written by a woman in her twenties.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She said that she had the sense of sin since she was very young.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She wondered how a person like herself could face God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To her this was impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She visited many churches and talked with many pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She asked them questions and tried to find out from them how she could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This went on for seven or eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many told her that she had to do better before she could believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Others told her that she should pray more and study the Bible more.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Still others told her to do good and perform noble deeds, or to do this or do that before she could believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As time went by, she found herself worse than before.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the end, she met an old preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>She asked the old man what she must do before she could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The old man put his hand on her back and said, "Go to God just as you are."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She jumped up and asked, "Do I not have to do better, make more progress, and improve more before I can believe in the Lord Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The old man said, "There is no such need.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You can come just as you are."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On that day, she became clear and realized that she could come to the Lord just as she was.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God knows that we are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is why He sent us the Doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Friends, have you ever been sick?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Suppose I have a fever of one hundred five degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If I ask the doctor to come, will he say that he will come when the temperature drops to one hundred three?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The sicker I am, the faster the doctor will come.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If a person's temperature is ninety-eight degrees, the doctor may say that since it is only ninety-eight degrees, there is no need to go.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The more serious your illness is, the faster the doctor will come.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The woman admitted that she was a sick person and that Jesus Christ is the Physician from God who came to heal her.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Not long after she returned home, she wrote this hymn: "Just as I am...I come!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I come!"</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Friends, what is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Grace is to come just as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There is no need to change or reform ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We come just as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Many people think that a preacher is one who exhorts others to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But I never do this.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If I exhort others to do good, I am merely putting powder and cosmetics on their faces and then sending them to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The Shanghai mortuary does a good job of grooming and touching up dead people and putting them into coffins.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If I am a preacher exhorting men to do good, I am doing nothing except telling them to improve themselves and then go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>But hell does not need any improved or reformed persons.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The Lord Jesus did not come to first make men better and then save them.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He came to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He died and shed His blood for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He died on the cross to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He resurrected in order that we may not only be redeemed and forgiven, but receive the life of God, be saved, and have eternal life.</S>
