   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The following excerpts from her open letters, published in The Present Testimony while substituting for Brother Nee, show to some extent her spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>She wrote the following in the seventh issue of March 27, 1929:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more our vision is enlarged to see the eternal will of God, the more joyful and hopeful we are, and the more we need to recognize clearly the boundaries which God has measured to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If God has raised up some to do another kind of work, we ask the Lord to bless it and our hearts rejoice for it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we, in ourselves, dare not start a work in order to meet the pressing need in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we pray for and hope for is that we may be faithful to the Lord within the limits which He has measured to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we consider that the church shares the same life as Christ and will ultimately grow up fully into Him, the Head, we simply cannot refrain from praising with singing this mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Oh brothers and sisters, may the Lord stir up our fervent and loving heart to rise and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Pray to hasten the completion of the building of the Body of Christ and the coming of His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The following excerpt is from the eighth issue of The Present Testimony, published May 18, 1929:</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not want the truths of God to be stored only in the heads of men, nor to always be displayed on bookshelves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we want them to be assimilated into the human spirit and to be manifested in human living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, although every issue contains only a few pages, the messages therein are important.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We hope that with every issue you receive you do not merely read it through, but rather spend time to comprehend it in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not simply by knowing the truth that it becomes yours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, it is after you have experienced the truth that you obtain its deliverance and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
