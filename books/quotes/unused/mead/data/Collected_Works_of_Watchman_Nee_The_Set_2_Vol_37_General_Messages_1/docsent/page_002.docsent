   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREFACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Volumes 37 and 38 of the Collected Works contain miscellaneous messages given by Brother Watchman Nee between 1934 and 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some are words of exhortation and comfort; others are short expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of these messages were included in a Chinese series entitled Twelve Baskets Full, which consists of twelve books of miscellaneous messages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Four of these books have been previously published by the Living Stream Ministry under the title Twelve Baskets Full, Volumes 1 4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since these messages were not originally published as a series under the title Twelve Baskets Full they were later compiled from various sources by the Taiwan Gospel Bookroom , we have chosen to include them in the Collected Works under the title General Messages 1 and General Messages 2 .</S>
