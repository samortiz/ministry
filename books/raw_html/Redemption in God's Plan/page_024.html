<h1 class="title">THE ACCOMPLISHING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:4, 14, 17; Rom. 1:4; 4:25; 6:8-10; John 10:17-18; 11:25; 14:19-20; 20:17, 19-20, 26-27; Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18; Luke 24:13-43; Eph. 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:3; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; Heb. 2:11-12</h1>
<p>We have seen the first two steps in God&rsquo;s plan of redemption&mdash;the incarnation and the cross of Christ. Now we will consider the third step&mdash;the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The death of Christ accomplished a full redemption and dealt with all our problems, and it fulfilled all God&rsquo;s requirements related to our redemption. Nothing needs to be added to Christ&rsquo;s redemption. However, the resurrection of Christ is still necessary for the effective accomplishments of His death to be applied to us (1 Cor. 15:14). His death redeemed us from our sins and satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. His resurrection, however, enables us to receive His life and to be joined with Him, that is, to enter into Him and receive the benefits of His substitutionary death. Through His resurrection we also become the righteousness of God in Him and are acceptable to God (Rom. 4:25; 1 Cor. 15:17; 2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>Although we were included in Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, He can sow the element of His mysterious death into our being only because He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. Although His death destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14), we can experience His overcoming of Satan only because His Satan-overcoming life has entered into us through His resurrection. Although He tasted death for us and nullified death (v. 9; 2 Tim. 1:10), His life has been made available to us only because of His resurrection. Without resurrection His life would not be able to enter into us. We can receive His life, and He can enter into us to be our life so that we may be joined to Him, participate in His death, and experience the accomplishments of His death only because of His resurrection.</p>
<p>If Christ were not resurrected, how could He save us? If He were held by death, how could He give us life? If He could not overcome death, how could He save us out of death? If He could only redeem us from sins but not overcome death, how could He deliver us from the law of sin and of death (Rom. 8:1-2)? If He were not raised from the dead to be designated the Son of God in the power of resurrection, how could people believe that He is the Son of God (1:4), and how could He give people His life and make them sons of God to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal plan? The fulfillment of all these matters depends on His resurrection. Without His resurrection, the fulfillment of these matters would be impossible. His resurrection is essential.</p>
<p>In fact, without the resurrection of Christ we would not even know of His redemption, much less receive His salvation. Without Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, how could we know that He has redeemed us from our sins, that His death has satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, and that God has accepted His redemptive death on our behalf? Without Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead, how could He demonstrate that He tasted death for us, that He destroyed Satan, who had the might of death, and that He nullified death? Christ&rsquo;s resurrection enables us to know these matters. His resurrection is the proof and assurance of these matters. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection enables us to know, believe, and obtain these things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REALITY OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection is a reality, just as His redemptive death is a reality. His death is different from that of every other person. We die because we have committed sins, whereas Christ died to redeem man from sin. We die because we are overcome and held captive by death, whereas Christ died in order to overcome and nullify death. We have no choice other than death, because we are under sin. He died because He was above sin. Except for His desire to redeem us, He could have chosen not to die. We die involuntarily and reluctantly. He died voluntarily and willingly. He willingly died for us and laid down His life for us (John 10:17-18). We die because of sin, and we are subject to the judgment of death and unable to escape. He died for the redemption from sin, and He removed the judgment of sin.</p>
<p>Our sin offends and contradicts God&rsquo;s righteousness; consequently, God&rsquo;s righteousness condemns us to death and puts us to death (Rom. 6:23). Because Christ&rsquo;s redemption fulfilled and satisfied God&rsquo;s righteousness, God delivered Him out of death and raised Him from the dead according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. We are held by death because we have been overcome and captured by death, but Christ died to overcome and nullify death. When He died, He could not be held by death; instead, He came out of death in resurrection (Acts 2:24).</p>
<p>Death is very strong (S. S. 8:6). No one can resist when death comes. Hades collects those who have been taken captive by death (Rev. 6:8); death gains people through sin as a sting (1 Cor. 15:55-56). When people are stung by sin, they fall into the hand of death and are unable to resist. In contrast, the Lord Jesus did not fall into death because of sin. He did not know sin, and He was without sin (2 Cor. 5:21). He was never contaminated by sin. The devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), tempted the Lord to sin and even attempted to put Him to death. However, the Lord overcame him entirely. Satan&rsquo;s intention in tempting the Lord was to put Him to death through sin. However, Satan&rsquo;s temptations were rebuffed by the Lord, and he could not gain anything from the Lord. The Lord caused Satan to have nothing in Him (John 14:30). Satan was unable to inject death into the Lord or put Him to death, as he had done with Adam.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and entered into death in order to do God&rsquo;s will and carry out God&rsquo;s plan to accomplish redemption, deal with sin, nullify death, terminate the old creation, and destroy Satan. He willingly walked into death instead of being captured by death. He determined to nullify death through death voluntarily, instead of being overcome by death and being taken captive by death involuntarily (10:17-18). Acts 2:24 says, &ldquo;Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.&rdquo; When the Lord entered into death, Satan, who has the might of death, must have exhausted all the power of Hades and death to hold Him. Although Satan uses death to hold those who have been taken captive by sin and death, he cannot use death to hold the Lord, who walked into death voluntarily to nullify death through death by the resurrection life in Him.</p>
<p>Satan has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), but the Lord is the Author of life (Acts 3:15). The Lord is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). Although death is strong, it is not stronger than life and resurrection. Life swallows up death, and resurrection overcomes death. The Lord is the resurrection and the life, so it is impossible for Him to be held by death. Instead, He overcame death. Death can hold only those who do not have life; it cannot hold the Lord of life. In His resurrection the Lord broke through death and Hades. His powerful resurrection life caused Him to overcome death, break the hold of death, and resurrect from the dead. He entered into death and walked into Hades in order to save us. After three days He walked out of Hades and was raised from the dead, overcoming death forever because of the great power of His life (1 Cor. 15:3-4). Death cannot lord it over Him (Rom. 6:9; Rev. 1:18).</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
