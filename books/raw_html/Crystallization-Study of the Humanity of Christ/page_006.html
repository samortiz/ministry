<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The King of the Kingdom of God</H2><P>As the seed of David, in His humanity, He is the King of the kingdom of God for the consummation of God's eternal economy (2 Sam. 7:13b; Matt. 16:19; Rev. 11:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE BRANCH OF JESSE, THE FATHER OF DAVID</H2><P>Christ in His humanity is the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, and also the branch of Jesse, the father of David (Isa. 11:1-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Twig from Jesse's Stem</H2><P>Christ is a twig from Jesse's stem&#151;the last part of a cut trunk close to the roots (v. 1a). The royal family of David had been cut to the bottom. The whole trunk of David's family had been cut close to the roots, leaving only a twig from the stem. Christ was born out of the family of David as a twig which grew into a new branch, the branch of Jesse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Spirit of Jehovah Resting upon Him</H2><P>Isaiah prophesied that the Spirit of Jehovah&#151;the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of understanding, the Spirit of counsel, the Spirit of might, the Spirit of knowledge, and the Spirit of the fear of Jehovah&#151;would rest upon Christ (v. 2). In the human living of Jesus, the branch of Jesse, people saw the Spirit of God with all these attributes. He was full of the Spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah. No human being has ever feared God as much as Jesus did.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Given by God the Authority to Execute Judgment in Righteousness over the Earth</H2><P>In His humanity Christ would delight in the fear of Jehovah, and as the King of Israel, in His humanity, He was given by God the authority to execute judgment (John 5:27) in righteousness over the earth and make all the creatures of God live in peaceful harmony in the millennium (Isa. 11:3-9). Isaiah reveals that in the kingdom of one thousand years, the wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, the nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, and upon the viper's den the weaned child will stretch his hand. In the millennium through Christ as the branch of Jesse, all the creatures of God will live in peaceful harmony.</P>
