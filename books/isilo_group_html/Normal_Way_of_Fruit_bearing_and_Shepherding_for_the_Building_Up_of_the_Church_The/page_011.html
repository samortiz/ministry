<p>According to the divine economy of the Bible, if we desire to receive, we need to give. If we water others, we ourselves will be watered, and if we desire to grow in life, we need to help others to grow (Prov. 11:25). When we help others to grow in life, we ourselves will have the growth. The way to receive is to give, and the more we give, the more we receive (Luke 6:38; Acts 20:35). Therefore, we should not believe our situation. Our situation with respect to whether we are good or bad, useful or not useful, is a lie. We should not say that we can do nothing and are not useful. Rather, we need to say, &ldquo;Satan, get away from me. I can do something, I have something, and I am useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; We should declare this to the whole universe, not by feeling or according to our situation but by faith. If we will all declare this, our whole situation will change. In contrast, the more we say that we have nothing and can do nothing, the more our usefulness is killed. The liar Satan works subtly to produce many liars (John 8:44b). Satan may use even a wife to tell her husband that he is useless, and he may use the husband to say the same thing to the wife. Satan may use even the children to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to the meetings so much. What use can you be to the church?&rdquo; We need to speak against the lie, saying, &ldquo;I do have something, and I can do something.&rdquo; When we say we do not have, we lose what we have, but when we say we have something, we add to what we have. Therefore, we should endeavor to water others and care for them.</p>
<p>Although the Lord promised a child to Abraham, the child did not come for many years. The Lord even put Abraham into a situation in which he was forced to pray for the household of Abimelech so that they could have children (Gen. 20:17). If we were Abraham, we might have found it difficult to pray. We might have said, &ldquo;I am too pitiful. I have been praying for myself for many years, yet I have not received a child. How can I pray for them?&rdquo; However, when Abraham prayed, God answered the prayer not only for Abimelech but also for Abraham (21:1-2). If we turn our prayer from ourselves to others, we will receive what we desire (Job 42:10). It is because we are too self-centered in our prayer that the Lord needs to teach us a lesson. If we water others, we will be watered, and if we care for others, we will be cared for.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPENDING AND BEING UTTERLY SPENT<br />
ON BEHALF OF OTHERS</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul said, &ldquo;But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:15). This passage has the sense of sacrificing one&rsquo;s wealth and one&rsquo;s life. <em>Spend</em> refers to the spending of Paul&rsquo;s possessions, and <em>be utterly spent</em> is the spending of what he was, referring to his being. If we have a spirit to spend whatever we have and to be spent, to sacrifice whatever we are, we will have a great increase each year. At the present time, our rate of increase is very low. This is because we have not adequately spent what we have and what we are. We have reserved our spending and preserved our self. It is impossible to have a higher rate of increase under this condition. As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the Boxers in China had a slogan: &ldquo;Kill all the Westerners and their followers, except Mr. Corbett.&rdquo; This is because that missionary spent everything and was spent for the Chinese people. Whenever any poor ones came to him, he would give them something, such as dinner or lodging. He reserved nothing. Eventually, when he himself was short of something, the people knew it was because he had spent it on them.</p>
<p>Paul was this kind of person. He always spent and was spent. He meant business with the Lord. He was on earth for nothing else but to gain people. Therefore, he also said, &ldquo;To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak. To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:22). Some in the church life are too strong in their disposition to be touchable in this way; it seems that no one can cause them to be shaped. Paul, however, seemed to have no disposition of his own. He was simply like a piece of wood that could be cut into any shape. Because his disposition was fully dealt with by the Lord, it was soft, bendable, flexible, and applicable to any situation. In my training in Taiwan in 1954, I told the serving ones that they should have a character and a disposition like paste, that can be applied to any kind of surface. On the contrary, some of the brothers and sisters are like pieces of hard rock that cannot be applied to any situation. This kind of &ldquo;rock&rdquo; is good only for beating others. Some may even feel good about this and say that a hard piece of rock was useful to the Lord to kill the Philistine giant (1 Sam. 17:49), but it is pitiful to think in this way. On the one hand, we need to be strong, but on the other hand, we should not be hard. We need to be soft, flexible, and applicable, good for any situation we are placed in, able to fit into every bend and corner.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
