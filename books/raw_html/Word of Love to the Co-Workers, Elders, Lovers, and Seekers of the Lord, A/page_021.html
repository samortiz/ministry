<h2 class="head2">Being One Who Endeavors<br />to Keep the Oneness of the Spirit,<br />the Oneness of the Universal Body,<br />by Taking the Unique Ground of the Local Church</h2><p>One whom you follow must be one who endeavors to keep the oneness of the Spirit, the oneness of the universal Body, by taking the unique ground of the local church. Everyone agrees with the speaking about the oneness of the universal Body. Who can deny this truth? In Christ we all are one Body universally. <i>Universally</i> refers not only to space but also time. Paul lived nearly two thousand years ago, but we are one with him. Moreover, a brother in Germany lives thousands of miles away, but we are still one with him. This is universal oneness, in which we are one with all believers. However, even if you say that you are for the oneness of the Body, to not take the unique ground of the local church is strong evidence that you do not care for the oneness of the Body. In actuality, you are one with no one; you are one only with yourself. You yourself should first be clear about the oneness; otherwise, you will be deceived.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING STRONGLY DISCERNING<br />IN THE ACCEPTING OF THE DIVINE REVELATION ACCORDING TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</h2><h2 class="head2">The Accepting of the Divine Revelation<br />Being Governed by the Eternal Economy of God, by Christ, and by the Body of Christ<br />for the New Jerusalem</h2><p>We must be strongly discerning in the accepting of the divine revelation according to the holy Scriptures. The accepting of the divine revelation must be governed by three things. The first is the eternal economy of God as the basic principle. Many Christians today argue with one another, but very few know that in the Bible there is such a thing as the eternal economy of God. The accepting of the divine revelation must also be governed by Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. God has an economy, and Christ is the centrality and universality of this economy. In other words, Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>I have spoken strongly concerning God&rsquo;s economy in the last ten or more years, and I have published three or four books on God&rsquo;s economy. The first, <i>The Economy of God,</i> was published in 1968. It did not speak of God&rsquo;s economy as a plan but of God&rsquo;s economy in our being concerning our spirit, our mind, our will, and our emotion. I spoke further on God&rsquo;s economy beginning from Stuttgart, Germany in 1984 and continuing on the east coast of the United States and in Irving, Texas. This speaking was published as <i>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</i> Today if you would ask me to speak something basic, I cannot stay away from God&rsquo;s economy. Anything that is basic must be according to God&rsquo;s economy. The hub and the rim of the eternal economy of God is Christ. God has no plan outside of Christ. Christ is everything. The term <i>Christ as the centrality and universality</i> was used by Brother Nee since 1934 when he gave messages concerning Christ being all in all. I received much help from those messages.</p><p>The accepting of the divine revelation must also be governed by the Body of Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem as the divine goal of the processed and consummated Triune God. John 4:14 says, &ldquo;The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.&rdquo; The Triune God is a fountain emerging to be a spring and gushing up to be a river flowing into eternal life. The fountain is God the Father, the spring is God the Son, and the river is God the Spirit flowing as living water into eternal life. For more than fifty years I tried to understand the phrase <i>into eternal life,</i> but I was unable. In recent days, however, I have come to know the meaning. <i>Into eternal life</i> does not mean to enter into eternal life. It means to become the eternal life. The flowing of the Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river eventually becomes the eternal life, which is the New Jerusalem. The entire Bible shows us that our God is the flowing God. God flowed in the Father as the fountain, and the Father emerged, was manifested, to be the Son as the spring, and the gushing river is the Spirit. The issue, the consummation, of this flowing is the New Jerusalem. From Genesis to Revelation the entire Bible speaks only about this flowing Triune God, and the issue of Their flowing is the New Jerusalem. Just as a man is the consummation of the human life, the consummation of the divine life is the New Jerusalem.</p>
