You have gathered us again to open up Your word to us. We are open to You and are ready to receive You and Your word. We want to know Your resurrection in the spirit. Be with us. Be one spirit with us at this time so that we can be one spirit with You. Lord, be gracious to us, and pour Yourself out upon us and into us that we would have good fellowship in You and receive the best supply from You. Lord, grant us the word, the expression, and the utterance that You may freely speak what You want to speak and that we may touch Your will in a real way, that we could be those who are in Your heart in this age and who take this way of resurrection in spirit.<p>Lord, lead us, not only during these days of the training but all the days of our lives, that we would be in Your Spirit. Thank You that You are strengthening our inner man step by step that we could be persons in this age fulfilling Your purpose by building up the Body of Christ. Lord, oppose and destroy the enemy for us, and cover us with Your victorious blood. We hide in You under the covering of Your blood. Fight for us. We want to behold Your victory. Although we are still under sufferings and attacks, we enjoy You and experience You in a real way every day. Lord, make everything we hear real to us, and make everything that You show us true to us. We declare once again that You are the Lord. You are the sovereign One, and You are even the victorious One. We are here following You. Our hearts are set. Our wills are strengthened. Our spirits are high. We open our mouths to praise You, to sing lauds to You, to exalt Your name, to testify and speak of You everywhere, and to dispense You to others. Lord, speak to us directly now. Amen!<h2 class=head1>SUBSTANTIATING SPIRITUAL THINGS BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>This message is a continuation of the last message. In the last message we covered the matter of our service being in the spirit and with the spirit as the sphere and the element. Moreover, we serve by this spirit. This spirit is the noblest part of our whole being. We the saved ones were not only created but are regenerated as well. Jesus has passed through all the processes and has accomplished everything, adding humanity to Himself, and uplifting humanity and bringing it into His divinity, that humanity may receive the life of God in His divinity. Today He is the firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity in Him. This is not all. He has been processed and is consummated as the life-giving Spirit. Not only is the Holy Spirit of God in Him, the complete Triune God is now in this life-giving Spirit. Now this Spirit abides in us. How noble and transcendent is this One in us today! The Lord of the universe, the Triune God, who has passed through all the processes to become the life-giving Spirit, is now in our spirit. We receive this truth not by our feelings, nor by our mentality, but as a spiritual fact.<p>A spiritual fact is a mysterious matter. We need the mercy of God to have this substantiated into a reality through Him being in us as our faith (Heb. 11:1). For example, in our body, there are many facts which we can neither see nor feel. We acknowledge these organic mysteries in the body not by feeling, but by the facts. In the same way, God purposely created a spirit for man at the time of creation to receive Him as life and as the food of life. Hence, whenever we mention God, we have to be in the spirit. Outside the spirit we cannot serve God and we cannot worship God. He is Spirit, and we must worship Him with the spirit in us which is the same as His nature. When we exercise our spirit, it is like touching electricity with a piece of metal; immediately electricity is passed through to our hand. The lesson of serving in the spirit is one which everyone who desires to serve the Lord has to learn from youth. We have to continually practice touching God with our spirit.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages in Preparation for the Spread of the Gospel &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
