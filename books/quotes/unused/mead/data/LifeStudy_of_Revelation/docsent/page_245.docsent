   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE THE NEW JERUSALEM 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover two very crucial aspects of New Jerusalem its gates and its street.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Undoubtedly, the city proper, the wall, and the foundations are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if the New Jerusalem had no gates, there would be no way to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In that case, this city would not be at all practical; it would be good only for exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But because the New Jerusalem has twelve gates, it is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some ministries are good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, because these ministries have no gates and no streets, there is no way to actually enter into what they have to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The special character of Brother Nee s ministry is that whenever he ministered a particular matter, he always gave you a clear view of the way to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many talk about Romans chapters five, six, seven, and eight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But no matter how much they talk about these chapters, they do not give you the way to get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee s book, The Normal Christian Life, on the contrary, shows us the gates and a definite way to practice what this book describes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more you read this book, the more you can see the gates it provides for you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although I appreciated certain other ministries in the past, I eventually discovered that there was no way to enter into what was being presented.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ones who had those ministries could show me a beautiful building in the air that I could admire, but they provided no practical way for me to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ministry in the Lord s recovery today continues the principle of Brother Nee s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything we minister is presented in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, you have a way to enter into what the ministry provides you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, New Jerusalem is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Its practicality is seen in its gates and in its street.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No matter from what direction you approach this city, you have a way to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This matter of practicality has caused me to lose a number of good, intimate friends in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once I was invited to England to stay with a brother who had an outstanding ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While I was there, this brother and I had a number of long conversations lasting two to three hours each.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All our conversations concerned the practicality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We both had seen the Body, God s present testimony, and the principle of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I could echo what this brother had seen, and he could echo what I had seen, especially regarding the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, there was a difference between us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the help of Brother Nee, I had seen the practicality of the Body and was burdened to take care of this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But those related to this ministry in England did not care for the practical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, through our lengthy conversations, I learned that this brother had only the view of the Body, but no practical way to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He neither saw this practicality nor was willing to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I made it clear to him that we wanted not only the vision of the Body, but also the practicality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In my concern for the practicality of the church, I have published the book entitled, The Practical Expression of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although I have lost some dear friends over the matter of the practicality of the church, the way is still the way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During the more than eighteen years since my visit with this brother in England, the Lord has vindicated the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>ITS GATES</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us now devote our attention to the gates of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The significance of the gates is not less profound than that of the foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is crucial to grasp the significance of these twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A. Three on Each of the Four Sides</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation 21:13 reveals that in New Jerusalem there are three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the city lies square v. 16 , with three gates on each of its four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The east side at the front, toward the glory of the sunrising, ranks first; the north side at the top ranks second; the south side at the bottom ranks third; and the west side at the rear ranks fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The gates on the four sides are toward the four directions of the earth, signifying the availability of the entrance of the holy city to all the peoples on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Compare with the four heads of the river in Genesis 2:10-14.</S>
