<h2 class="head2">C. From the Christ on Earth<br />to the Christ in Heaven</h2><p>This turn in the book of Hebrews is also from the Christ on earth to the Christ in heaven (7:26). The Christ whom we now experience and enjoy day by day is the Christ in heaven. While many Christians are anxious to go to heaven, we are now enjoying the Christ who is in heaven. Hebrews turns us from the Christ on earth to the Christ in heaven.</p><h2 class="head2">D. From the Suffering Jesus<br />on the Pathway of the Cross<br />to the Glorified Christ on the Throne of God</h2><p>Furthermore, this turn is from the suffering Jesus on the pathway of the cross to the glorified Christ on the throne of God (12:2; 13:12; 8:1). Many books have been written on the suffering Jesus and on the pathway of the cross. Many who are still on the pathway need the book of Hebrews to turn them to the glorified Christ on the throne of God. Christ is now on the throne.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE TWO ASPECTS OF CHRIST&rsquo;S PRIESTHOOD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typified by Aaron on Earth</h2><p>Not many Christians know the two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s priesthood. Although many know that Christ is our High Priest, very few realize that with Christ&rsquo;s priesthood there are two aspects. The first aspect is the priesthood of Christ typified by Aaron on earth. This is fully revealed in 5:1-5.</p><h2 class="head2">B. According to the Order of Melchisedec<br />in Heaven</h2><p>The second aspect of Christ&rsquo;s priesthood is that according to the order of Melchisedec in heaven (6:20; 7:1). In 6:20 we read that as the Forerunner the Lord is now within the veil, in the Holy of Holies in heaven. As we have seen, the first aspect of Christ&rsquo;s priesthood is mainly for the forgiveness of sin, and the second aspect is mainly for the overcoming of sin. The first aspect brings us out of Egypt, and the second aspect ushers us into Canaan. On the cross, Christ was a High Priest typified by Aaron. Now we must press on to enter into the full participation in His priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec. If we do this, we shall have a complete overcoming of sin and sin will be absolutely under our feet. We shall be on the second floor, in the Holy of Holies, having nothing to do with sin but continually enjoying grace. This is altogether related to the second aspect of Christ&rsquo;s ministry.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TWO SECTIONS OF CHRIST&rsquo;S MINISTRY</h2><p>Based upon the two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s priesthood, there are two sections of Christ&rsquo;s ministry&mdash;the section on earth and the section in heaven. It is very interesting to see that in both sections of Christ&rsquo;s ministry there are exactly eleven items. Now, in a brief way, we need to consider the two sections of Christ&rsquo;s ministry.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Section on Earth</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Having Offered Himself to God<br />for Our Sins</h2><p>Christ offered Himself to God for our sins (7:27; 9:14, 26; 10:10, 12). The first thing that our Lord did in His priestly ministry was to offer Himself to God for our sins. He was the real sin offering, the unique sin offering. From the foundation of the world, Christ was the unique sin offering (Rev. 13:8). As such an offering, He offered Himself to God for our sins. If you read the book of Hebrews carefully, you will discover that it presents Christ only as the sin offering, not as any other kind of offering. In the book of Hebrews the unique offering is the offering for sin. Christ offered Himself to God for our sins once for all and He does not need to do it again. It was accomplished once for all for eternity.</p><p>We all must declare and announce the good tidings that the problem of sin has been solved. Do not listen to the lies. Even your experience is a lie. Sin is no longer here. We all must declare, &ldquo;Sin has been taken away.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s offering of Himself put away sin. Thus John 1:29 says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; However, many Christians do not realize or believe that sin has been taken away. Do you believe that sin has been taken away? Do not believe that sin is still here. Even if you have a failure or defeat you must tell Satan, &ldquo;Satan, I don&rsquo;t believe you. I believe the Holy Word which says that sin has been taken away.&rdquo; We all must believe this. We must forget our experiences and what we are, strongly take the Lord&rsquo;s word, and declare to the enemy and to the whole universe, &ldquo;Hallelujah, sin has been taken away. Sin has nothing to do with me any longer because Christ offered Himself to God to take it away.&rdquo;</p>
