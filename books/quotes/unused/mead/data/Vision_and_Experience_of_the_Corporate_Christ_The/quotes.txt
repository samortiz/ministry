[2]  The Reality of Baptism Being to Put People into the Processed, Incorporated God
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE RECOVERY OF GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE MAN S FALL AND THE NEED FOR RECOVERY
[4]  We praise the Lord that we are in His recovery.
[5]  However, if we are serious about being in the Lord s recovery, we need to consider what the Lord s recovery is.
[6]  THE PROGRESSIVE REVELATION OF THE PURE WORD The Bachelor God
[7]  By the Lord s mercy we have the divine Word, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from Genesis through Revelation.
[8]  Although this verse is wonderful, it indicates that God was alone.
[9]  We need to see not only that Christ is the Lamb of God 1:36 but also that Christ is the Bridegroom who will have His bride.
[10]  Therefore, He created the heavens and the earth, and in the heavens and the earth He created man in His image in order that man would match Him v. 26 . After God said that it was not good for the man whom He had created in His image to be alone, He brought every animal of the field and every bird of heaven to the man to see what he would call them 2:18-19 . Genesis 2:20 says, The man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of heaven and to every animal of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper as his counterpart.
[11]  In chapter 17 the Lord went on to pray that we all may be one one not in ourselves but in Him.
[12]  Verse 21 says, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.
[13]  Our oneness is the oneness in the Triune God.
[14]  We know that God realized that it was not good for Him to remain alone, for He said that it was not good for the man whom He had made in His image to be alone v. 26; 2:18 . It was not good for God to remain as a bachelor.
[15]  The Christian life and the church life are not a matter of ethics, culture, or religion but a matter of the indwelling God.
[16]  However, there is a fifth and final stage of the progressive revelation of God in the Bible.
[17]  After the bachelor God, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God are revealed, God is revealed as the incorporated God.
[18]  The hub, the center, of this wheel is God and the Lamb, the Lamb-God, the incarnated and redeeming God.
[19]  We do not need to wait until the end of Revelation to see the incorporated God.
[20]  As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ...You are all one in Christ Jesus vv.
[21]  We need to explain that Jesus is no longer the raw God but the processed God.
[22]  After the Lord s charge in Matthew 28:19, He promised in verse 20, Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.
[23]  After the Lord comes into us by our calling on His name, and after we are put into Him through baptism, He will never leave us, and we can never get away from Him.
[24]  When a person calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we should baptize him into the Triune God, into the living Christ, and into His Body.
[25]  We should explain to every new believer, Now that you have called on the Lord and He has entered into you, the church will baptize you into the Triune God, which is also to baptize you into Christ and into the Body of Christ.
[26]  When we feel weak, we need to call on the Lord to be strengthened with Christ as power v. 24 . Whenever I need to share a message and do not know what to say, I pray, O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! What are You speaking, Lord? When I pray in this way, I always receive a message.
[27]  In the Body-Christ, whom we have received and in whom we are walking, dwells all the fullness of the Godhead.
[28]  Ephesians 3:8-10 shows that Paul preached the riches of Christ, from which the church is produced.
[29]  The first verse of the Bible says, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
[30]  Some may admit that the consummate word in the Bible concerns God s building, but they may point out that the New Jerusalem is in the future and argue that in order to be practical, we need to focus on something that exists today.
[31]  However, God s building is not something that exists only in the future; it is here today.
[32]  The Building in Peter s Experience and Writings Peter Being a Stone for God s Building and
[33]  Peter took the lead to say, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . Jesus appreciated his answer and said, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.
[34]  Regarding this, the Lord seemed to be telling Peter, You are blessed to know that Jesus is the Son of God, the very Christ appointed and anointed by God to fulfill His purpose, but I also say to you that I will build My church.
[35]  Christ as the cornerstone was disowned by the Jews yet honored and treasured by God because God s desire is not only to save us but also to regenerate and transform us into precious stones to build up the church.
[36]  From his days as a young disciple, Peter never forgot that he was a stone or that Christ was the rock on which the church is built.
[37]  Hence, when Peter had grown old, he wrote in his first Epistle, Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[38]  In Ephesians 2:21 Paul said, In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.
[39]  However, in verse 22 Paul went on, In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[40]  The Bible Ending with a Call and a Promise
[41]  At the consummation of the Bible there is a call and a promise.
[42]  This is a call to come to drink of the water of life that proceeds out of the throne of the Lamb-God, the redeeming God v. 1 . This flow is the flow of the living God.
[43]  BEING FULFILLED THROUGH HIS PROCESS AND OUR TRANSFORMATION GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE
[44]  Ephesians 3:11 says, According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[45]  It is because of the Lord s mercy and grace that today we are able to see and speak of God s eternal purpose, which is to work Himself into all of His chosen people as their life, nature, and everything that they may be fully saturated by and with God Himself.
[46]  As the divine revelation, the Bible tells us that God has a desire.
[47]  God s desire is to dispense Himself and work Himself into us to be our life, our nature, and everything to us so that we could live our human life in a divine way.
[48]  God the Father is in the Son John 14:11 , and the Son as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
