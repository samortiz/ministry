<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, when God shook up Jacob, what was found? Idols were found in Jacob's house! Such a spiritual person, one who knew God very much, had not only forgotten his vow, but also had hidden idols in his house! We still have idols hidden in us, and the inner voice is not enough to shake them out. It takes outward circumstances to shake them out! Brothers and sisters, in order to return to Bethel, all these things must be surrendered! If you ignore your first vow and allow these things to remain in your house while claiming to obey the inner leading and inner voice, God will raise up circumstances that will shake you so that the idols in your house will be shaken out. He can even shake out the golden earrings and other improper objects in your house. In our fellowship with the Lord, we often are not sensitive to His rebukes and our mistakes. God has to raise up an environment to shake us up. Then we will realize that there are still hidden idols that we have not yet given up. We should not trust ourselves and say, "As long as I have the peace within, I am all right." We do need to inwardly hearken to the inner voice, but brothers and sisters, we must realize how deeply we have fallen, how difficult it is for us to stand, and how easy it is for us to fall. At times our inner feelings are not that sensitive, and the inner admonition is not that strong. Therefore, we still need God to speak to us through the environment. Brothers and sisters, we may have been Christians for many years. As far as our experiences are concerned, we may have made considerable progress since our first time in Bethel. But as far as our consecration goes, we may have lost our initial consecration at Bethel. God is happy to see that we have some experiences and to work Himself into us through these experiences, but He is even happier to see us sustaining our initial fresh consecration. Brothers and sisters, no matter how mature you are, you still have to return to Bethel. From Jacob's experience, we can see that God had worked much into him, and much of His element had been deposited into him. Yet Jacob had lost his initial vow of consecration. This is why God had to speak to him through the environment. Jacob was already very spiritual, yet God still had to speak to him through the environment.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to just have the inner voice. Sometimes we still need the speaking of the outward environment. We may want to settle down comfortably in Shechem, but God will raise up the environment so that we cannot settle down comfortably. He wants us to fulfill our first consecration; He wants us to return to Bethel. We may have forgotten our vow, but God has not forgotten it. We may not have honored our consecration, but God honors it. Brothers and sisters, consecration exposes our shortcomings. Whenever we turn back to our initial consecration, we find many unnecessary things within us, and we find that we have backslidden. Brothers and sisters, we should not think that we are that spiritual and that we have no problems at all. Go and pray, perhaps saying, "Lord, seven years ago I was revived for the first time. I prayed that night and consecrated everything on the altar; I offered up everything to you. Today I will offer up everything to you again." Once we return to our first vow, we will find that we have many unnecessary things. We will realize that we have fallen away from our initial consecration. We may be more experienced than before and we may boast that we know God more and that we are more mature, but when we turn back to our initial consecration, we will see we have fallen and that we have idols and golden earrings in spite of our maturity. There are many things that need to be buried. We need to bury the idols and the earrings under the oak tree in Shechem before we can return to Bethel to serve the Lord. Brothers and sisters, Jacob was mature, yet he did not return to Bethel until God raised up the environment and spoke to him.</p><p>We should consider whether God's voice is in our environment calling us back to Bethel. We have come to where we are, and all our needs have been met. We would like to settle down, but will God let us settle down? We have our rest, but does God have His rest? Has He gained what we vowed to Him at Bethel? God has to raise up the environment to turn some brothers and sisters back to Bethel, that is, to their first vow. If we have given up our first vow, God will order an environment to stir us up, to make us restless, and to speak to our inner being. The environment that God has ordered for us will not affect us without also speaking something to us. Brothers and sisters, even a man as spiritual as Jacob could not hear God's speaking except through the environment. We should never presume that everything is fine as long as we feel peaceful inside. Sometimes our feelings of peace are a kind of self-deception. We may say that our heart is at peace, but have we received more of the Lord's correction recently? Have we been reminded by Him? How much has God gained in us? How much has He stripped from us? Brothers and sisters, we must remember that we should have the Lord's speaking in our environment. We should hear God's voice through the environment and return to Bethel, to our initial vow of consecration so that God can be satisfied.</p>
