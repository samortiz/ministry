   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Using Facts and Experiences as References</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apart from the above points, we also need to use facts and experiences as references.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 15 shows that the brothers had a discussion v. 7 ; this means that all the attendants had an equal right to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today when the eighty-some elders of the church in Taipei come together, every elder has an equal right to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this kind of speaking should not be the same as in the worldly conferences in which quarrels and fights occur.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to understand that even in our discussion, we need to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we follow the Spirit, our spirit will not desire to fight but will require us to be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are no chairmen in our meetings; no one pounds a gavel and holds a sign to ask people to be quiet; rather, the Holy Spirit within us always pounds a small gavel and reminds us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Testimony of Peter</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter s speaking in Acts 15 was a testimony vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter was in Jerusalem not long after being rebuked by Paul Gal 2:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter was severely rebuked by Paul and fully put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Humanly speaking, he did not seem to have the position to be an apostle; nevertheless, in Acts 15, at the conference in Jerusalem, he was full of courage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When everyone finished the discussion, Peter stood up to speak to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said, Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe v. 7 . This is to read the facts, experiences, and present condition of the brothers and sisters; this was Peter s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Testimonies of Barnabas and Paul</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After Peter s speaking, Barnabas and Paul further strengthened his speaking with their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They related to the elders and apostles who were at the conference in Jerusalem the signs and wonders that God had done among the Gentiles through them v. 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Making Decisions according to</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>the Truth in God s Word James s Views Based upon the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the brothers finished their testimonies, James decided the matter by offering his views based upon the truth in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see that James spoke very well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His speaking was fully in tune with the testimony of Peter and also with that of Barnabas and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was fully in coordination with the brothers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>13-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we must also point out that James s decision was still very much under the influence of his Jewish background.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Scriptures he quoted were correct, but in the end he added something of Judaism by speaking of what is strangled and blood v. 20 . It was right that James spoke according to the truth, but he also added something of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we need to be careful not to add our own ideas to God s idea because of our background.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Decision of the Holy Spirit and</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>the Apostles with the Elders</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, a resolution was formed in Acts 15, which was the decision of the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders; this is beautiful vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>22, 28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostles and elders had the revelation of the Bible and the instant revelation of the Holy Spirit according to the condition of the saints at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then based on this they made a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sadly, although the decision was correct, it was mixed with James s opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We absolutely believe that Paul was not satisfied with part of the decision, because it contradicted his concept in Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The matter of abstaining from blood and from that which is strangled belongs to Judaism and should not be added to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May we all learn the lesson.</S>
