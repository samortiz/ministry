[1]  When Christ was living on earth, He was not fully available to the disciples.
[2]  When a person believes in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit comes into this person and lives within him.
[3]  All these forms of life are wonderful; but there is a fourth kind of life the divine life, which is God's uncreated life.
[4]  Thus, the plant life exists for the animal life and supports the animal life, and the animal life is for the human life.
[5]  In fact, the plant life, the animal life, and the human life are merely shadows and pictures of the divine life.
[6]  In chapter four there is a sinful woman who came to draw water at a well.
[7]  When she met Christ there, she persisted in religious questions concerning the place where men should worship God.
[8]  The Lord told her that if she would ask Him, He would give her "living water," the water of life, and that when she had this life, she would not be thirsty anymore.
[9]  Just as our human life is sustained by eating food and drinking water, so the divine life is received by the way of eating and drinking.
[10]  The river of life is a picture of Christ as the Spirit of life, and the tree of life is a picture of Christ as the supply of life to man in the form of food.
