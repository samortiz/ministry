   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mary's Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 11:29-32 we have Mary's opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 32 she said, "Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jews' Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 33 says, "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in His spirit, and was troubled" v. 33 . The Lord groaned in His spirit because He realized that no one, including Mary, knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible says that the Lord groaned in His spirit, not in His emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His spirit He was one with God and was having fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He realized the situation and perceived that everyone around Him, the unbelievers, Martha and Mary, and all the disciples, did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was the reason the Lord groaned and even wept v. 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Expressing their opinion, the Jews said, "Behold how he loved him!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But some of them said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have also caused that this man should not die?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These verses indicate that the Jews did not understand why the Lord wept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They thought that Jesus wept out of love for Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord, however, did not weep for that reason.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He groaned in His spirit and wept because of their ignorance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>None of them knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that very moment, the Lord was the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But no one realized this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The situation today is similar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not many Christians truly know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not many know Him as resurrection, as life, and as the present One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Martha's Opinion Again</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they came to the cave where Lazarus was buried, the Lord Jesus said, "Take away the stone" v. 39 . But Martha, expressing her opinion again, said, "Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he has been there" v. 39b . This opinion caused further frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there had not been any opinion, it is likely that the Lord Jesus would have resurrected Lazarus at least half a day earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But all the different opinions delayed the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A LIFE-GIVING SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, the Lord overcame all the opinions, and Lazarus came out of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The resurrection of Lazarus is a sign indicating that the Lord Jesus is not merely a healing Savior, but is a life-giving Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord wants to give us life, to resurrect us, not only to heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in our concept we have the thought of healing, not the thought of life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reason we do not have the thought of life-giving is that we do not realize what our need actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may think that our need is to be healed of our sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, our problem is not merely sickness our problem is death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we need not only healing, but we need life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John is a clear picture of all of us under the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have even begun to smell.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we not only need healing; we need the Lord as the life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need Him to give us life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All Christians appreciate the Lord Jesus as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, not many appreciate Him as the life-giving Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, they may only realize that as the Savior He is mighty, sufficient, and able.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was young, I was not taught that Jesus Christ is our Savior in the sense of being the One who gives us life, that He saves us by giving life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need the Lord not only as a mighty Savior; we also need Him as the life-giving Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of merely asking the Lord to help you, ask Him to give you life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to say, "O Lord Jesus, I need Your life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, impart Yourself into my being as life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I need You as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, I'm not only sick and weak I'm dying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My sickness is not a disease; my sickness is death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, what I need, Lord, is You imparted into me to be my life."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's salvation is a matter of resurrection, not a matter of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regeneration is the initial stage of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every aspect of God's salvation involves resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After resurrecting us through regeneration, the Lord is now continuing this process of resurrection by sanctifying and transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, the Lord will glorify us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That glorification will be the consummation of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's salvation, therefore, is a process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He has resurrected us in our regeneration, and now He is continually resurrecting us through sanctification and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then as the consummation of the process of resurrection, He will glorify us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Later on we shall see that chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John are in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone who enters the Holy of Holies has not only been forgiven of his sins by God, but is also one fully resurrected from the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whoever enters the Holy of Holies must pass through the riven veil.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This veil signifies our flesh, our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The natural man must be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then when we come into the Holy of Holies, we shall no longer be a natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, we shall be a resurrected person, a person regenerated and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In resurrection life we then may have direct fellowship with God in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Apostle John shows us that in order to come into the Holy of Holies, we need to begin our journey at the altar, at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then in life we need to experience Christ as the showbread table and the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we enter the Holy of Holies, we shall no longer be natural; we shall be fully in resurrection fellowshipping with our God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this way we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</S>
