   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Attitude of the Christian</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have traced the appropriation and manifestation of Redemption from age to age, and now let us consider what should be the attitude of the Christian in view of the wonderful revelation that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There must be a constant recognition of our identification with our Crucified, Risen, Victorious, Ascended Lord, and definite reckoning upon His Life, moment by moment, if we are to demonstrate the completeness of His Redemptive work as fully as He desires, before He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God the Holy Spirit is preparing a "little flock" to overcome even as He overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ would not wish to return until He could say of these overcoming ones, "They overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>See Rev 12:11.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice the promises to the overcomers, in the second and third chapters of The Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They mean something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dogmatic assertion ill becomes a Christian who is looking for the Coming of Christ; therefore the teacher should not insist upon the acceptance of any particular view as to those who are translated in the First Rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Possibly a more careful study of the Oriental harvest time and the various offerings connected therewith, would revolutionize many theories that are advanced at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The main question to be considered is individual preparedness and a walk with God like Enoch of old.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Christian should remember that the Life of the God-Man is for each member of His Body, moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Simply and continuously should the Christian live out the "Life of the Man in the Glory."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a hard, strained life; rather it is the normal life of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are the channels through which His Life flows to others, refreshing us meanwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a blessed life, because we realize our need and utter dependence; consequently we are kept from self-energy and self-esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every moment of every day, we may draw from His fullness for all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Continually may we sing:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There's a Man in the Glory</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whose Life is for me.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And His Life in the Glory,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My life must be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There's a Man in the Glory</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whose Life is for me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He overcame Satan;</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From bondage He's free.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Life He is reigning;</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There's a Man in the Glory</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whose Life is for me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His peace is abiding;</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Patient is He.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He's joyful and radiant,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Expecting to see</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His Life in the Glory</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lived out in me.</S>
