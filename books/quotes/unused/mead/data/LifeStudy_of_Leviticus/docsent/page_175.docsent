   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Blemishes Defects That Disqualify a Person from the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider the various defects that disqualify a person from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Blindness</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Blindness v. 18b disqualified a person from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Blindness signifies a lack of sight for seeing because of the shortage of Christ as the enlightening light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are short of Christ in His light, we shall not have the adequate sight, and this shortage will disqualify us from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As New Testament believers, we are God's priests, yet we still need the sight to see spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this, we need to experience Christ, particularly in the sense of light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we experience Christ in this way, we shall be under His enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we shall receive the light and the sight to see what others cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lameness</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lameness v. 18c signifies the lack of strength for acting because of the shortage of the strengthening Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many believers today are lame, crippled, and are thus disqualified from the New Testament priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The old way of meeting and serving in traditional Christianity is a cause of this lameness, for it annuls the organic function of the believers and thereby annuls their qualification to serve as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to learn to do everything in the strengthening Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul could say, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we learn to enjoy Christ's strengthening, we shall not be lame and shall not walk in a crippled way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A Flat Nose</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A flat nose v. 18d signifies the lack of Christ as our sensation in our service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many things in the spiritual realm cannot be seen or touched, but they can be sensed, that is, "smelled."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would be able to sense these things, we need a proper nose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that in order to serve God as priests, we need a keen sense of smell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a necessary part of our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seeker in Song of Songs is praised for having a nose "as the tower of Lebanon" S.S. 7:4b . This kind of nose is not flat but is elevated and has a keen sense of smell.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Having One Limb Longer Than the Other</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having one limb longer than the other v. 18e signifies overstepping and overtouching outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some saints overstep or overtouch outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We, however, should remain within our limit, and our limit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should be limited by our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are limited in this way, we shall be balanced and not have one limb longer than another.</S>
