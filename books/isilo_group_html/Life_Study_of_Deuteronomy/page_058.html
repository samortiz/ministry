The Freeing of a Hebrew<br>Male Servant or Female Servant</H2><P>Deuteronomy 15:12-18 speaks of the freeing of a Hebrew male servant or female servant. Such a servant was one of God's people who sold himself to be someone's slave.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Servants Being Set Free after Six Years of Service</H2><P>"If your brother, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, he shall serve you six years; but in the seventh year you shall set him free" (v. 12). The reason a Hebrew servant was to be set free after six years of service is that God is a God of rest. After doing the work of creation for six days, He rested on the seventh day (Gen. 2:2). The people created by God were also to work for six days and rest on the seventh day. In Deuteronomy 15:12, the principle of resting after a period of work is applied to a Hebrew servant. From this we see that God is not only wise but also that He sympathizes with man. God is concerned for man and cares for man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Master Not Sending the Servants<br>Away Empty-handed but Supplying Them Richly</H2><P>"When you set him free, you shall not send him away empty-handed; you must supply him richly out of your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress; as Jehovah your God has blessed you, so shall you give to him" (vv. 13-14). God is not a God of scarcity but a God of riches, plenty, and surplus. For this reason, the master was to richly supply the servant who was being released.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Deuteronomy &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
