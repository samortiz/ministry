We have the Holy Spirit within us and the Holy Bible in our hand. The Holy Spirit within us is actually the wonderful Christ, the all-inclusive Christ, the compounded Christ. When I say the compounded Christ, I mean that now this Christ is no more simply God. He is God but also man. He was God incarnated to be a man, and now He still has the human nature. He is divine as well as human. He is compounded. He also went to the cross and was crucified. He walked into death, through death, and out of death. He was not captured by death. He conquered death, subdued death, and walked out of death. Then He was resurrected, and He ascended to the heavens, where He was enthroned. He has accomplished all these things and has attained the highest place in the universe. His accomplishment is a complete accomplishment, and His attainment is the highest attainment. He has the divine nature and the human nature, and He has such a complete accomplishment and high attainment. He is the compounded Christ. He is the all-inclusive Christ, yet today He is within us as the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Do not consider that the Holy Spirit is someone other than Christ. Christ is the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam is Christ, and the life-giving Spirit, no doubt, is the Holy Spirit. So Christ became the Spirit. Also, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. This is our quotation from the Bible, not our interpretation. The Lord Christ is the very Holy Spirit who dwells within us.</P><P>Furthermore, the Bible is the breath of God, and the breath of God is the Spirit. The Lord Jesus told us that the words He speaks to us are spirit and life (John 6:63). The holy Word says that all Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). Every word of this holy book is the breath of God, the Spirit. So we have Christ within us as the Spirit, and we have the Bible in our hand as the Spirit. The way to enjoy Christ as the Spirit is to call upon Him and to pray-read His word.</P><P>When you live a life of calling on the Lord, all the barriers will be broken down. Then there will be a thorough passage for Christ to get in and to get out of you. If you open the window, the air without gets in and the air within gets out. When you call, "O Lord Jesus," the window of your being is opened, and the air gets in and gets out. This is the way to enjoy Christ. The way to touch the Word is to pray-read. You need the calling, the praying, and the reading. You have to mingle your reading with praying and calling on the name of the Lord.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
