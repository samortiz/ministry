   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Two Results</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These two men have two acts, and the two acts have brought forth two results.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Result of Adam s Transgression a. Sin Entered</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sin entered through Adam s transgression 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It seems that sin is mentioned in Romans 5 through 8 in a personified way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is like a person who can reign 5:21 , who can lord it over people 6:14 , who can deceive and kill people 7:11 , who can dwell in people and do things against their will 7:17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin is alive and exceedingly active 7:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, this sin must be the evil nature of Satan, the evil one, dwelling, acting, and working in fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sin is actually an evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through Adam s transgression sin entered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Were Constituted Sinners</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result of Adam s disobedience, the many, including us, were constituted sinners 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We not only were made sinners; we were constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were not created sinners, but constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An element not created by God was injected into our being and constituted us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not sinners by accident; we are sinners by constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sin has been wrought into us and constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, sin is not just an outward deed, but an inward, subjective element in our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we are typical sinners by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All Men Were Condemned unto Death</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, all men have been condemned to death 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All men are born of Adam and in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So, through Adam s one offense all men have been condemned to death in him as he was condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Death Reigned over All Men</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, death reigns over all men 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Death has become a king ruling over all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As sin reigned in death 5:21 so death reigns through sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>e. In Adam All Die</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The final result of Adam s transgression is that in Adam all die 1 Cor 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone has died in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes we say of a certain person, He is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I first heard this phrase, I immediately thought, Not only is that person dying everyone is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not say that you are living, for you, like everyone else, are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are living to die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more you live, the more you die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a sense, people are not living but dying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are all born to die, because we have a powerful king over us named death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was inaugurated by sin, his forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sin brought death into power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, all men are under the reign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This dreadful person has been inaugurated as king.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we were born in Adam, we began to die.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before people die absolutely, they sin, and sin hastens the hour of death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more you sin, the faster you die; the less you sin, the slower you die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do not want to die quickly, you should not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must stay away from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Result of Christ s Obedience</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praise the Lord that we have the second man, the second act, and the second result!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the result of Christ s obedience?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>a. Grace Came</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Grace came John 1:17 through the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The grace of God has abounded to many 5:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul does not say that life has abounded.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is similar to Adam s transgression, in which sin came first and death followed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Likewise, through the obedience of Christ grace came first and life followed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Death is versus life, and grace is versus sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sin came from Adam s transgression, but grace came through Christ s obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sin is Satan personified, come to poison us, damage us, and bring death into us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Grace is God personified, come to give us life and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through Adam s transgression, sin entered the human race as poison for man s destruction, but through Christ s righteous, obedient act God came as grace for our enjoyment.</S>
