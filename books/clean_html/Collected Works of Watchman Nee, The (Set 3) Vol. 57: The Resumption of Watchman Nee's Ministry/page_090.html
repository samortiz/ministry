<h2 class="head1">SERVING GOD BEING THE HIGHEST GLORY</h2><h2 class="head2">God Honoring Us<br />and Granting Us the Favor</h2><p>When I was in England I heard of a brother by the name of C. A. Coates. Someone once gave one of his books to the Queen of England. The Queen read the book and was helped by it. However, Coates had written eight books. When I was in England, I asked the British brothers, "Since Coates has eight books, why would he not give the other seven books to the Queen?'' The brothers did not say anything. They acted as if I had said something wrong. Later, I asked some other people and learned that a common English person could not give a book to the Queen. Even if you tried to give her a book, she might not necessarily accept it.</p><p>Consecration is God honoring us. It is not a favor we grant to God. Rather, it is God's acceptance of us and of our possessions. Hence, it is God's honor to us. We are not granting Him a favor; He is granting us a favor. For God to accept persons such as we is the greatest privilege He can grant to us. If I kneel before God and He sends a fire to consume the sacrifice, it is His favor to me in accepting my service. Man thinks that he is sacrificing himself by consecrating to God. Little does he realize that God's accepting him is His mercy. Why do we have to calculate so much? We have to learn to push our way through to serve Him, to crawl before Him, and to kneel before Him. A man should learn to humble himself before God. We are not begging you to go to God. Rather, you should beg to go to Him yourself.</p><h2 class="head2">Serving God Being to Our Profit and Being<br />the Result of the Lord's Dynamic Salvation</h2><p>The China Textile Corporation no longer dares to issue any more shares because they will be sold within half an hour. Today the blind ones are not the ones who cannot see; the blind ones are the ones who do not see. Our only fear should be that we give too little to God, that God will not accept what we give to Him. Is our consecration a profit for God, or is it a profit for us? Is it a favor we render to God, or a favor God renders to us? When we come to God, the only thing we should fear is that God will reject and deny us. We should only fear that we give to God too little, that He will not accept us. Those who know God will say, "Lord, here is some more. Here is some more.'' Those who have once seen the Lord can give half of what they have to the poor without any complaint. The Lord said to Zaccheus, "Today salvation has come to this house'' (Luke 19:9). Today many people do not realize the greatness of the Lord's salvation. This is why they encounter difficulties. Salvation not only saves our soul; it means that we are delivered from everything. Let us remember the story of our burial. Why were we baptized? Baptism is a declaration that we have been separated from the world. Merely inviting three or five people to come and serve will not solve the problem. What we need today is for the whole Body to rise up for the gospel. The demand for the co-workers in the days ahead is quite severe. The need is also very great. For the sake of China's gospel, for the sake of the co-workers going on, we need a fresh consecration.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED IN SERVICE AND THE WAY OF SERVICE</h2><p>If I had a hundred billion dollars today, I could distribute it all for proper use within a few days. Our work needs money. From now on we have to work with a goal and with proper arrangements. All the co-workers are living for the Lord. We ask all the brothers and sisters with a job to offer up themselves also. We have to work in coordination and in the Body. None of us is for ourselves. We must live for the Lord and for the gospel. We cannot have part of the people offering up themselves, while part of the people are not offering up themselves. We need all the brothers and sisters to offer up themselves and to live for the gospel. Those who are teaching or who are in business have to offer up everything for the gospel. The Lord has to do what He did in the first century. We are not afraid of believing in the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of preaching the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of acting according to the first-century gospel. If we would rise up as a whole Body, the whole of China will be taken; no one will be able to withstand us. If we do not believe in a thorough gospel and if we do not have a thorough consecration, it will be difficult for the Lord to use us.</p><p>The gospel has been preached in China for over a century, but it has been restricted to the coastal regions. Not much has been done in the inland regions. We have wasted twenty years. If we are not faithful again, we will be set aside.</p><h2 class="head1">A STRONG TESTIMONY PRODUCING A STRONG RESULT</h2><p>In the first century men were not able to preach the gospel freely. They did not go to the church buildings. At that time men believed because they saw the gospel and saw the Christians. The Christians at that time were hiding in their homes. When they were put on the fiery stakes, they were seen and heard for the first time. The effect of seeing the gospel is much stronger than that of hearing the gospel. This kind of gospel shows men that salvation is not cheap. The prayer of the martyrs during those hours became their gospel messages. Historians tell us that the believers in Rome were killed first, and the ones who were not killed were exiled.</p><p>Today Christianity is weak in others because it is weak in us. During the first century, men were afraid, yet they kept coming. Today lukewarm Christians are useless ones. On the one hand, the testimonies of the early believers frightened many people away. But on the other hand, this kind of gospel also made many frightened of running away. Where there is the apostles' service, there is the apostles' blessing. Today the whole responsibility rests on our work. If the Lord cannot get through among us, He cannot get through anywhere. The past twenty years, while we were praying and seeking, the Lord was preparing us. However, if the young ruler came today, he might not stay any longer. Today we have to offer up all our money, time, and heart. Only then will the Lord have a way, and only then can we reach our destiny. We should not allow money to choke our heart, and we should not allow it to block man's way to God. All the brothers and sisters have to participate in the spiritual work, and all possessions have to be offered up. If we do this, the Lord will have a free way among us.</p>
