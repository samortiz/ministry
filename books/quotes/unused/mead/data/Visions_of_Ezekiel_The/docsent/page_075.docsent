   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord's Strong Desire for His House</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hallelujah! the Lord returned to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because He had lost His standing on the earth, He went back to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is His standing on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the building up of His house, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for the Lord to come back to this earth, He needs a built-up church standing on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He will come back, not simply to this earth, but to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord, and he also saw a man standing by him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He not only saw the glory of the Lord, he saw the Lord as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The man stood by him and said, "Son of man, the place of my throne" 43:7 , proving that the man who stood by Ezekiel was the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was a man who said, "The place of my throne."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the grammatical construction, "the place of my throne, the place of the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the children forever," does not seem to be a good composition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It may be because the Lord's desire and joy was with His house, He neglected the grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was fully occupied with His house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people have said that Witness Lee is too much for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I feel that I am not enough for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord was so happy with His house that He forgot about the grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Upon His return to the temple, He was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hallelujah! the house was recovered! the place was recovered!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once more the Lord had a place for the soles of His feet!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Oh, the Lord's desire is for the church!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has been desiring and waiting to come back to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why we have so much joy in the meetings, and this is why we are so happy and crazy in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is because the Lord Jesus within us is also happy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has a place, the place of His throne, and the place of the soles of His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without the recovery of the proper church life, the Lord has no place for the soles of His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For centuries the Lord has simply been in the air with no place for the soles of His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How happy the Lord is now that in the local churches there is a place for the soles of His feet!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I had been Ezekiel I might have asked, "Lord, are You not the almighty God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why do You care for such a small, narrow place only twenty by twenty cubits?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why are You so happy with this little place?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord would answer, "I just love this place on the earth, I just care for this little place on the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord cares for the recovery of the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The place of the soles of His feet is also the place of His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The throne is for God's government and administration and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the place where He can administrate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The soles of the feet are for His move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the temple God has no base for His administration and no base for His move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Unless the church is built up, the Lord has no standing to administrate His government and to move upon this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, this is the very place where the Lord can dwell for rest and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE PEOPLE'S WHOREDOM AND CARCASSES</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to Ezekiel 43:7 the people, the house of Israel, had offended the Lord in two things: in their whoredom and in their carcasses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord did not rebuke the house of Israel for their behavior and conduct, but for their whoredom and carcasses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whoredom is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, suppose a wife is nice, kind, truthful, and patient but besides her husband she loves and stays with another man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is whoredom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To the church at Ephesus in Revelation 2, the Lord said that they had done many good works, but they had lost the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord meant that, besides Himself, they loved some other things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is whoredom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regardless of how good or how pure or how holy something may be, if we love that thing more than we love the Lord Himself, it is a kind of whoredom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Christianity, not many care simply for the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, many care for other good, pure, fundamental, spiritual, and holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This caring is a kind of whoredom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What then are the carcasses?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The carcasses are the dead things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 7 says, "neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places of Zion ."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may add these two words "of Zion" as a kind of interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It means the high places on Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the custom, the carcasses of the kings were buried beside the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So the Lord says the threshold of the carcasses was close to His threshold.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The post of their grave was close to His post in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There was only one wall between.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On one side was the Lord's sanctuary, and on the other side was the grave of the carcasses of the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These were not the carcasses of the lower people, but of the kings of high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us apply this matter to today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, the so-called church weddings with the wedding march, with the procession of the bride and the groom, with all the worldly attire, and with all kinds of dead things is a carcass of the king.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you attend that kind of wedding, you can sense the stinking of the carcasses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not the carcass of the lower people, but the carcass of a high standard, of the king.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then, on the next Lord's Day morning in their service, Miss Jones sings a solo.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She comes to the front with a dress which exposes her bare shoulders, and she is painted with blue, white, and red as she stands there singing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That is really a carcass, really something dead.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>That is not a carcass of a lower standard, but of a higher standard, having a high education and a high standard of music.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That is really a carcass of the king.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When you listen to that kind of solo, do you have the sensation it is a praise to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When I was there, I only had the sensation of the stinking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today's Christianity is full of whoredom, full of carcasses.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Years ago, I visited Westminster Cathedral in London.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Oh, that church building is full of carcasses.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even John Wesley's carcass was there.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The carcasses of many famous people are buried under that roof.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I told the British brother who brought me there that it was really a church of dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It was full of carcasses.</S>
