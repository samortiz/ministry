   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of all God's creatures, only human beings have a conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the part within that either accuses or excuses you cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rom 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you deal with your conscience, you are dealing with both your spirit and your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If your conscience has never been dealt with, you are of no use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A radio has a little receiver, without which it will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The paint may be chipped, but the radio will still work as long as the receiver is good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same is true of our conscience; it must be kept in good working order.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we first received the gospel, the Lord required that we confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Confessing our sins clears our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without repenting and confessing your sins, you could not have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit of God could not have gotten into you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once you repent and confess, the Spirit enters into you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more thorough the confession is, the more Spirit you have within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PURIFYING THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit, then, comes into our being through our cleansed conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without this cleansing, He cannot enter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 9:14 says that the blood of Christ purifies our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not think that serving the living God means doing something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible to serve Him means to contact Him, to receive Him, to have Him infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The proper service or worship of God is that we give Him an opening so that He can infuse Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of serving requires a purified, or purged, conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood of Christ purges our conscience that we may serve, not the doctrinal God, but the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 5:3 the Lord says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without a purified conscience, your spirit cannot be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in verse 8 He says, "Blessed are the pure in heart."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even more, a pure heart requires a purged conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to go to the Lord to deal with our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may feel you have only one little, unimportant thing to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you will just confess that one thing, that initial confession will be a little turn to lead you onto the highway.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may then find you need a long time to complete a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as you attempt to deal with the Lord in this way, the phone may ring.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once you take care of that phone call, it will take some effort to get back on the highway of your confession.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After you confess two more things, the phone may ring again, this time probably a wrong number.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the subtle enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is best to get away by yourself, away from the phone and everyone else, or at least take the phone off the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you share a room with someone else, you may need to find another place so no one can disturb you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once you kneel or sit before the Lord and open up to Him, you will find you have miles of confession to make.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may need hours to confess all your shortcomings, weak points, evil doings, your sinfulness, your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you start cleaning your house, you may think you can finish in fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when you get into it, you will find dirt and dust all over, in all the corners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are like your house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In every corner of your being, in every room, on every shelf, there is dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your eyes have been dirtied by the many sinful things you have looked at day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your ears have been sullied by listening to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your mouth needs cleansing from the gossip you have spread.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE EFFECT OF A PURIFIED CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After such a confession, you will not want to go back home.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You will be afraid you may hear more gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It takes a great deal of effort to clean a badly smeared window.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once it is clean, you will try very hard not to let it get dirty again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the way to keep a clear entry for Christ to come into you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This entry, your purged conscience, will keep you from gossip.</S>
