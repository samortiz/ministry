   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE TREASURES The Life-studies</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden is that we would enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must spend time to get into the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have the assurance and I strongly believe that the Life-study messages are the best tool for opening the Bible for our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both those who are young and those who are old should spend two hours a day getting into one Life-study message, including the verses related to the message, and the footnotes and cross references related to the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are willing to read one message a day in this way for six days every week, in one year you will be able to read three hundred messages, and in four years you will have read all the New Testament Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are willing to make a strong decision to do this and if you study diligently for four years, you will have a good foundation in the holy Word of God; not only so, you will also grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Basic Truths in the Lord s Recovery God s Creation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first item of the basic truths in the Bible is God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to grasp this truth, we must read the first chapter of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are several subpoints related to God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, God created nonliving things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are the heavens, the earth, light, the atmosphere, and all other myriads of things without life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second, God created living things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are three steps in this point: the creation of things with the lowest level of life, the creation of things with a higher level of life, and the creation of things with the highest level of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The lowest level of life includes things without feelings or consciousness like plants, the next level of life includes animals such as fish and birds, and the highest level of non-human life includes beasts like monkeys and horses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, God created the life that resembles Him, and this refers to the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God created man in His image and according to His likeness v. 26 . God created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must remember these points and spend time to get into the Bible to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should also refer to our books to learn the main items related to these points.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man s Fall</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second item of the basic truths is man s fall, which is recorded in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This item consists of two points.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, man transgressed and became a sinner, a transgressor before God; he was condemned by God s law Rom 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, in his transgression man s inward nature became sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When man fell, he not only broke God s law, which is outward, but also received Satan s poison, which is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way Satan entered into human nature and became man s sinful nature 7:17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, as a result of man s fall, man has both sinful deeds and a sinful nature; his outward deeds are sins, and his inward nature is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the results of man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God saves fallen human beings by resolving the problem of sins and by dealing with our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The hymn Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me Hymns, #1058 is a good Christian song.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a valuable, classic Christian hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The key point of this hymn is found in the last lines of the first stanza: Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Guilt is due to our outward sinful deeds and shows that we have received eternal punishment; power refers to the power of the sinful nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can we resolve the problem of sin and sins?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is through the water and the blood which flowed from the Lord s riven side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The blood redeems us from the eternal punishment related to our sins, and the water saves us from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the double cure mentioned in this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, this hymn is well written, and the truth in it is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows that we must have a thorough knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s blood washes away our outward transgressions and saves us from the guilt of eternal punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The water denotes the Lord s resurrection life, which enters into us and is the power to deliver us from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Romans 7:24 Paul said, Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who will deliver me from this body of this death?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is speaking of our inward, sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 8:1 Paul says, There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The condemnation here does not refer to being condemned to go to the lake of fire but to the condemning within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many husbands do not want to lose their temper with their wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They set their will and pray, but they still lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After getting angry, they condemn themselves for being wretched, and they wonder who can save them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, because the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death v. 2 . This is what is referred to in the line of the hymn Save me from its...power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The blood redeems us outwardly, and the life saves us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Redemption delivers us from our sinful deeds, and salvation delivers us from our sinful nature.</S>
