   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>James Bringing In</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Feeling in God's Presence</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After all were silent I particularly like the words here "James answered'' v. 13 . This was the final authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was generally recognized as the leading one among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He stood up and spoke in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can see that the meeting was in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Men, brothers, listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Simeon has related...'' vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After he repeated the words of Peter, he quoted a verse from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what God's Word says.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 19 then says, "Therefore I judge.''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He gave a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His opinion was, "Do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was not a word of debate or of contention; rather, he brought in God's presence and God's authority; he brought in God's word and the consideration and the feeling before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was in this way that the conference of the church succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not Merely Learning the Biblical Practice,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>but Possessing the Spirit of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brothers and sisters need to learn the things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not merely learn the method of the things; learn the spirit of the things also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we only have the method without the spirit, the method is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to have the method and at the same time we need to imitate the spirit of the people in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There must be that spirit and that presence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we live in that reality, we will be able to stop the speaking of the talkative ones in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are loose and casual, if God's presence is not evident with us, if God's authority upon us is not clear, if our attitudes, words, and actions are all casual, this kind of meeting will not have a good result.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the flesh cannot be restricted in us, neither can the flesh be restricted in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we cannot bind our own flesh, neither can we bind the flesh of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not allow God's presence to be manifested in us, submitting ourselves under God's authority, neither can we cause all the brothers to submit themselves under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a matter of our spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our spiritual condition is proper, the result will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If our spiritual condition is not proper, the result also will not be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may want to take Acts 15 as a method, but there is not one thing in the Bible that can be used as a method.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words in the Bible are definitely not a formula.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we work according to a formula, even if it is useful, the result is still void of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a matter of method, but a matter of spirit; it is not a matter of a formula, but a matter of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not that when you go out you know how to deal with the situations you encounter; rather, it is that you live before God and thus are able to bring the entire meeting before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do not live before God, you cannot bring the entire meeting before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may know the correct order of the procedures: Peter spoke first, Barnabas spoke second, Paul spoke third, James made the final decision, and the responsible brothers wrote the letter; however, the Bible does not give any ground to those who are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You cannot be a person who is not spiritual and yet merely learn the methods in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You need to learn to capture the spirit; then you can go forward with all the things falling into place spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometime later, when we come to the topic of reading the Bible, we will mention again that in studying the Bible the basic requirement is that we must connect with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only when we connect with the spirit are we able to understand God's Word; otherwise, we cannot understand it.</S>
