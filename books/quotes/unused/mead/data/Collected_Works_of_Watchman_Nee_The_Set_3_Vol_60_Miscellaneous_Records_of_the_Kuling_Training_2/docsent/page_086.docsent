   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE THE JUDAIZERS 1 WHO ARE THE JUDAIZERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 2:9 the Lord says, "I know your tribulation and poverty but you are rich and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of the sufferings of the church in Smyrna is the slander from those who call themselves Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who are these ones who call themselves Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Romans 2:28-29 and John 8:39-47, all those who believe in the Lord Jesus sincerely from their heart are the true Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who call themselves Jews are, of course, not the true Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are those who are Jews in the flesh only.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Judaizers are those who have come into the church but have not genuinely believed in the Lord and His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, they try to introduce Judaism into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They have been blaspheming the Lord since the day He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the church was produced, they continued to slander the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their slander was actually a reviling of the word of the gospel Acts 13:45; 18:6; 19:9; 28:22; Rom 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will call these ones the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are not ordinary Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They creep into the church with the intention of mixing Judaic thoughts with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Revelation the Lord shows that the first group of people who frustrated the church were the Judaizers in Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By then it had become a "synagogue of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Judaizers were organized and utilized by Satan to damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we come to the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3:9, we find these ones continuing to disrupt the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From church history we see that Christianity has been very much frustrated by Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once Christianity lets down its guard, Judaism creeps into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Old Testament priesthood was transformed into the pastoral system of the congregations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The law became the standard of one's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The festivals became ritualistic days which men had to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This mixture of Judaism began from the time of the church in Smyrna and was not checked until the time of the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The work of the Judaizers during that period appeared mainly in the form of the practices of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank the Lord that in the nineteenth century a group of people was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They overcame Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These ones belonged to the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But today there are still works of the Judaizers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These people preach some very serious heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to pay close attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We want to consider the three great errors of the Judaizers under three headings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first concerns their heretical stand with regards to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second concerns their attitude towards the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The third concerns their attitude towards life after death and the future judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to spend some time to study the teaching of the Judaizers so that new ones can identify their errors and deal with them when they encounter them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>HERETICAL TEACHING WITH REGARDS TO THE LAW General Heretical Teachings of the Judaizers</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>regarding the Law</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, let us consider the Judaizers' heresy regarding the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They base their heresy on the Old Testament law which is of two kinds, ceremonial and moral.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord came to annul the ceremonial ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that He annulled the ceremonial law, but He kept the moral law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Judaizers say that we should keep the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since the fourth commandment is the keeping of the Sabbath, they say we should keep the Sabbath as well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They say that the Sabbath should be kept on Saturday, not Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us see if this teaching is Scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not here to argue but to examine if a teaching is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it is, we have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to study the Judaizers' heresy regarding the law, we have to know the Scripture's teaching regarding the law.</S>
