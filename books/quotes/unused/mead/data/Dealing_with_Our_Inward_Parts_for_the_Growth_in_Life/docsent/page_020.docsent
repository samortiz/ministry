   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND THE FORM OF GODLINESS, ZEAL IN SERVICE, KNOWLEDGE, GIFTS, AND POWER Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:5; 1 Tim 3:16a; Acts 22:3; Rom 12:11; 1 Cor 8:1; 6:17; Num 22:28; 1 Cor 1:22-24; 3:1 THE OUTWARD FORM OF GODLINESS True Godliness Being the Likeness of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Timothy 3:5 says, "Having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power; from these also turn away."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see the difference between the growth of life and the form of godliness spoken of in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Again I say, we need to learn two lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One lesson is to know the reality of these truths, and the other is to learn how to present what we know in a clear way that is easy for people to apprehend and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Briefly speaking, godliness means God-likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be godly means to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Timothy 3:16a says, "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh, in a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, godliness is the likeness of God, to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a great subject.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man was created in the image of God, according to God's likeness, with the intention that he may be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is God's intention that we be like Him, that we have His image and His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Timothy 3:5, however, speaks of the outward form of godliness without its power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To deny the power of godliness is to not have its living reality, to have the form without the life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Form of Godliness Being Only the Outward Appearance of Godliness</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The form of godliness is only the outward appearance, the outward likeness, of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is holy, so we may try to be holy as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is separated from the common things, so we too may try to separate ourselves from the common things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is love, so we may try to be like God and show love to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition, God is light, so we too may try to be in light, avoiding everything of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is only the form, the outward appearance, of godliness, of God-likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In today's Christianity we can easily see many forms of godliness, especially when we come into a church "service."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many think that in order to show that they are godly, they must pick up their Bible on the Lord's Day morning and walk in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then when they come into the church building, they take a seat quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I was young, I was influenced to learn these things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the form of godliness, as is practiced by many in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is not the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus was a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was truly holy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was the real love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was the living reality, not the form.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What the Pharisees had was only a form, but what the Lord Jesus was, was the living reality of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Several centuries ago there was a certain man of God, a truly holy man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once he was invited to another city in order to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since he was famous, on the day of his arrival the people in that city were excited to welcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He anticipated that, so before he arrived, he disappeared from the public view and went to a little park to play on a seesaw with the children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the scheduled time for his arrival, the people could not find him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They looked throughout the town and eventually saw him playing with the children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In that age especially, people thought that a man of God must appear holy, like a priest with a long robe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That brother knew that if he would come into the city in this way, they would all admire him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, the people asked, "What kind of person is this?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is this a servant of God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is this a man of God that first goes to the park to play with the children?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In doing this he was trying to break their natural concept of godliness and to help them to realize what real godliness is.</S>
