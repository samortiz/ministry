[2]  The first stage of the experience of life is being in Christ.
[3]  From the point of view of knowing life, regeneration means that in addition to his original life man obtains the life of God.
[4]  Regeneration is not only the entering into us of God's life, it is also the birth of Christ within us.
[5]  As God's life enters into us in Christ and regenerates us, it is on one hand God's life entering into us, and on the other hand it can be said that Christ is born in us.
[6]  When we experience regeneration and the Holy Spirit enlightens us, we see ourselves as corrupt, sinning against God and man.
[7]  Therefore, at the time of our regeneration, because of our contrition, repentance, and faith in receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior, we can then contact in our spirit the life of God which is in Him.
[8]  Now we will look straightway at the second experience of life, namely, the clearance of the past.
[9]  Old ways of living refer to our entire old manner of living before we were saved.
[10]  After we are saved, we should not only put an end to all unrighteous, improper, and evil and unclean matters, but we must also put an end to our whole former manner of living and have a new beginning.
[11]  Usually, when we speak of the clearance of the past, we emphasize the ending of unrighteous, improper, and evil and unclean matters, but we are not likely to pay any attention to the ending of the old way of living.
[12]  What we have seen in the preceding chapters is the first state of spiritual life, that is, the experience "in Christ."
[13]  Now we will continue by looking at the second stage of the spiritual life, the experience of "abiding in Christ."
[14]  The second stage of the experience of life usually begins with consecration.
[15]  Many Christians wait until they are consecrated before they abide in Christ, have fellowship with Christ, and thus enjoy and experience Christ.
[16]  This verse reveals that God has redeemed us from under the law; God has bought us from under the law.
[17]  Although one knows the basis of consecration as having been bought and redeemed by God, yet this realization may not be sufficient to touch his feeling, move his heart, and cause him to consecrate himself willingly to God.
[18]  Whenever the Holy Spirit sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, we will naturally be willing to become the prisoners of love and consecrate ourselves to God.
[19]  When one sees the basis of consecration and also has the motive of consecration, he is willing to consecrate himself to God.
[20]  Since the meaning of consecration is to become a sacrifice, the thing offered is something which is entirely for God.
[21]  Those things we do for God which are pleasing and acceptable to Him can never go beyond that which we allow God to work.
[22]  If we want to touch spiritual things, whether it be to work for God, to study the Bible, to preach the gospel, or to oversee the church, we must first allow God to work on us that we might be broken, subdued, and disciplined by Him.
[23]  V. THE RESULT OF CONSECRATION TO ABANDON OUR FUTURE
[24]  The result of consecration is that we are caused to cut off all our relationships with people, matters, and things, and especially to abandon our future and wholly belong to God.
[25]  Brothers and sisters, if we have been enlightened, we will discover that even in our hope for more fruit in our work, our hope for more people to be saved through our gospel preaching, our hope to lead more brothers and sisters to love the Lord, and our hope for more local churches to be built by our hand even in these hopes there are hidden many elements which are for the building up of our future.
[26]  After we have gone through the five main points of consecration, we should be quite clear concerning the lesson of consecration.
[27]  Now that we have considered consecration, we must look into various dealings.
[28]  "Dealing" implies that we follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to purge away all the difficulties which hinder the growth of life.
[29]  Our dealing with sins is based only on the consciousness while in fellowship with God, not on all the facts of all the sins we have committed.
[30]  Therefore, the realm of the basis is much smaller than the realm of the object.
[31]  For example: if we have actually committed one hundred sins, but when we approach God we remember only ten sins while in fellowship with Him, we should deal with those ten sins of which we are conscious.
[32]  If we are aware of only ten percent, we deal with ten percent; if we are aware of twenty percent, we deal with twenty percent.
[33]  The first principle is to dispel all discord between others and ourselves.
[34]  Every sinful act of ours, when become known to others, whether it causes damage to them or not, results in a discordant condition between us.
[35]  For instance: if we abuse or curse another person, we have on one hand a record of sin before God, and we have made on the other hand a bad impression upon the one we have cursed and also upon any others who were present.
[36]  Therefore, if, after being enlightened, we become conscious of this, we have on the one hand to confess it to God and ask His forgiveness, and on the other hand to go to the persons concerned the one who was cursed and any others who were present to apologize and also to deal with what we have said.
[37]  We should go to whomever we have offended and deal with the matter.
[38]  If we confess our sin to those against whom we have not sinned or to those who do not know our sin, we not only give them a bad impression regarding us, but we may also arouse gossip, which would only do more harm to those against whom we have sinned.
[39]  Sometimes the amount we owe others is beyond our means to repay.
[40]  In this case we should ask their forgiveness and request them to allow us to repay either when we have sufficient means or in installments until they are fully paid.
[41]  Dealing with the world is very important in the initial experience of our Christian life; therefore, we shall study it carefully.
[42]  Generally, people feel only the damage of sin, but not that of the world, because sin is against morality, whereas the world does not oppose morality but God Himself.
[43]  Man is destitute of the concept of God; he has only a moral concept within him.
[44]  This is due to the fact that men neither know God nor have the concept of God, and therefore are ignorant of Satan's usurpation of man by the world.
[45]  Since the world opposes God and has such harmful effect upon man, we must consider its origin and process of development.
[46]  When we have learned how the world was formed, it is easy to define the world.
[47]  Originally, man belonged to God, lived by God and relied entirely upon Him.
[48]  We have seen that the world was formed after Cain's fall and separation from God.
[49]  Whenever Sodom is mentioned in the Bible, it always refers to her sins Gen 13:13; 18:20; 19:13 .
[50]  The Bible divides the history of the human race into two parts: Genesis 1 through 11:26 and Genesis 11:27 to the end of Revelation.
[51]  The first part began with the creation of man and ended with the destruction of the first world by the flood.
[52]  At the end of the New Testament the Great Babylon will be destroyed Rev 18:2 , and on the other hand the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven Rev 21:2-3 .
[53]  When man failed and lost God, he succumbed to the world; when man was saved by God, he subsequently left the world and lived in a tent as a stranger and sojourner, serving only God.
[54]  1 James 4:4, "Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
[55]  We must realize that God still requires us to live as a normal human being on this earth.
[56]  When Adam was in the Garden of Eden, God presented him with trees pleasant to the eye.
[57]  If a certain living necessity binds and hinders us from doing the will of God or from being completely gained by God, we are then usurped by it.
[58]  The basis of our dealing with the world is the same as dealing with sin.
[59]  Although dealing with the world will cause us to grow spiritually, yet if we wish to deal to the end that God may have a complete place within us, we should ask Him to draw us so that we may love Him more and pursue more for our spiritual growth, so that we may become more mature in life.
[60]  Now we come to the sixth experience of life, which is dealing with the conscience.
[61]  After we consecrate ourselves, we need to deal not only with sin and the world, but also with the conscience.
[62]  Therefore, dealing with sin and the world is dealing outwardly with our circumference, whereas dealing with our conscience is dealing with the central part of our being.
[63]  The position of the conscience is in the human spirit.
[64]  From the point of view of government, man's fall was a fall from God's rule to self-rule, and then from self-rule to man's rule.
[65]  The more one is ruled by God, the nobler he becomes, but the more one is ruled by man, the more base he becomes.
[66]  Since man has been degraded from God's rule to human rule, God, in saving man, must recover him from human rule to divine rule, that man may once more live before God in simplicity and under His direct authority.
[67]  Throughout generations, all saints who have been seeking life agree that the conscience is the window of our spirit just as the eye is the window of our body.
[68]  There are a total of seven of these neighboring parts: the mind, the emotion, the will, the intuition, the fellowship, the life of God, and the Spirit of God.
[69]  The feeling in the Christian's conscience is so rich because the heart of the Christian is a new heart, a heart which has been softened and renewed by God; his spirit is a new spirit, a spirit which has been revived and renewed by God; his mind, emotion, and will have also been considerably renewed; and he has as well the life of God and the Spirit of God.
[70]  The three categories of the feelings of the conscience are the result of our offenses we have either offended God or sinned against man In our intention, motive, word, and action.
[71]  The keener one's conscience is and the more one lives in the presence of God, the easier it will be for him to have a feeling of offense.
[72]  Hence, the result of dealing with our conscience, on the one hand, is to bring us into the light of God so that we will become more enlightened, and on the other hand, under such an enlightenment, to cause us to get rid of all the things that are outside of God, not agreeable with God, and not acceptable to God, so that we may experience a deeper cleansing.
[73]  Several conditions of a weak conscience can be both described and illustrated.
[74]  One condition is that after we have dealt with the conscience according to its feeling of offense, the conscience still feels condemned and accused.
[75]  For example, if you have sinned against a brother, when you fellowship with God you become enlightened and conscious of it; hence, you confess before God and to the brother.
[76]  In a normal situation the feeling of the conscience is based on the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, which, in turn, is based on the measure of our life.
[77]  I. The Feeling of the Conscience and the Growth of Life
[78]  Another strong basis for the feeling of the conscience is spiritual knowledge.
[79]  Spiritual knowledge does not mean mental understanding and comprehension of Bible truths or spiritual things, but denotes the understanding and realization of God and all the things of God through divine revelation and enlightenment.
[80]  Since a normal feeling of the conscience originates from life, the Holy Spirit, and spiritual knowledge, it certainly carries with it the supply of grace.
[81]  All normal feelings in our conscience, if in agreement with our growth of life and derived from the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, form the basis of dealing with the conscience.
[82]  When dealing with sin, we must deal only with the feeling that exists in our conscience toward sin; when dealing with the world, we must deal only with the feeling in our conscience toward the world; when dealing with other matters apart from sin and the world, we must deal only with the uneasy feelings in our conscience.
[83]  Yet, although this feeling of life comes from the life of God and the Holy Spirit, it is through the conscience that we sense it.
[84]  In dealing with the conscience we need to deal to such an extent that we have life and peace, but we also need a governing standard of dealing.
[85]  Generally speaking, the inward lack of life and peace must be dealt with until we obtain life and peace, but this does not mean that all feelings lacking life and peace demand dealings.
[86]  In this second stage of our spiritual life, we have studied consecutively the three lessons of dealing: sin, the world, and the conscience.
[87]  Therefore, if we want to know our condition before the Lord, or the condition of our spiritual growth, we must check with our experiences to see how much we have been dealt with by the Lord in these aspects.
[88]  The seventh lesson of the experience of life is that of obeying the teaching of the anointing.
[89]  There are various ways of describing this lesson, such as walking according to the Spirit, abiding in the Lord, living in fellowship with God, walking with God, and living in His presence.
[90]  The Word was God John 1:1 , and flesh denotes man; therefore, when the Word became flesh, it means that God became man and mingled Himself with man John 1:14 .
[91]  C. The Relationship between the Anointing and the Fellowship of Life
[92]  The fellowship of life is the flowing of life, the flowing together of God and all those possessing His life.
[93]  D. The Relationship between the Anointing and the Applying of the Blood
[94]  However, many areas of our being are incompatible with God, and many situations in our lives do not match God's righteousness, holiness, and glory; these make it impossible for God to mingle or unite with us.
[95]  A. The Relationship between the Teaching of the Anointing and the Anointing
[96]  The teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing and is the natural result of our being anointed.
[97]  When the anointing is moving within us, on the one hand, it anoints God into us, and on the other hand, it reveals God's mind to us.
[98]  Each time we experience the anointing within us, we gain firstly more of God Himself, more of God's components; this, then, produces a result it causes us to know what God wants us to do.
[99]  B. The Teaching of the Anointing and the Understanding of the Mind
[100]  Although the teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing; nevertheless, these two occupy different parts in our being.
[101]  C. The Teaching of the Anointing and the Feeling of the Conscience
[102]  There is an absolute relatedness between the teaching of the anointing and the feeling of the conscience.
[103]  We have said that the normal feeling of the conscience is derived from the Holy Spirit, who is in our spirit, and passes through our mind to enlighten us.
[104]  D. The Nature of the Teaching of the Anointing
[105]  We now come to see the nature and characteristic of the teaching of the anointing:
[106]  Thirdly, the teaching of the anointing is natural and not forced; neither is it something which is purposely sought after.
[107]  It may be while you are in fellowship with the Lord, or it may be while you are working, resting, or walking on the street, that spontaneously there is a feeling or teaching within you, in your deepest part.
[108]  If our spiritual life is normal, we should be able to feel the teaching of the anointing in such a very spontaneous way; otherwise, there is a problem with our living before the Lord.
[109]  Here we would say a little word about the practical way of entering into fellowship:
[110]  Firstly, we must know that the feeling of the anointing is the teaching of the anointing.
[111]  If we desire to enter into the fellowship of life, or, in other words, to enter into the anointing, we must first understand the teaching derived from the feeling of the anointing which is moving within us.
[112]  We have already said that the function of the anointing in letting us know what to do and what not to do is secondary.
[113]  The main purpose of experiencing the anointing is that we touch God Himself and have His presence.
[114]  For example, if we deliver a message, it is not only a question of whether or not we should speak, but whether or not we have the presence of God while speaking.
[115]  If God is not present, no matter how much or how well we speak, our inward being becomes emptier and emptier until at the very end of the message our spirit is completely empty; we cannot even pray for some time.
[116]  However, when we discuss this lesson on knowing the will of God, we cannot begin with the teaching of the anointing, because the anointing emphasizes the moving of the Holy Spirit in us and is not the will of God itself.
[117]  A. The Will of God Is His Heart Desire
[118]  When we speak of God's will, we must trace it to the desire of His heart.
[119]  Ephesians 1:5-12 is one of the most important portions in the Bible concerning the will of God.
[120]  God's will is not only His heart desire and His mingling with man, but also the fulfillment of His plan.
[121]  Generally, we are used to belittling and underestimating the will of God.
[122]  The strange thing is that today's Christians are occupied with many things that are not mentioned in the Bible.
[123]  Conversely, many things that are mentioned in the Bible are unknown to them.
[124]  The Bible never tells us to pay continuous attention to sickness, occupation, traveling, and other matters pertaining to our living, and to study the will of God concerning them.
[125]  Every time the will of God is mentioned in the Bible, it touches God's heart desire, God's plan, God's work on this earth, the church of God, the Body of Christ, etc., all of which are matters of great importance and eternal value.
[126]  The second means of knowing God's will is the Bible.
[127]  The Bible as God's Word tells us thoroughly and clearly what God desires to do in the universe and what His purpose is.
[128]  The fourth means by which we understand God's will is our heart, spirit, and mind.
[129]  God created these organs mainly for us to understand His will.
[130]  If we were like a chair, without a heart, spirit, or mind, we would still not understand His will, even though God had prepared all things in the universe, including the environment about us, and had given us the Bible.
[131]  We have seen the definition of God's will and the means by which God reveals His will.
[132]  The first two verses of Romans 12 show the clearest way to know God's will: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God."
[133]  The second step in the pathway of knowing the will of God is to deny the self.
[134]  If we are merely a sacrifice and have not denied ourselves, even though we are living for God, we are still living according to our own opinion and ideas.
[135]  The basic requirements for knowing the will of God are: 1 presenting ourselves as a sacrifice, and 2 denying our self.
[136]  We ought to bring all the details and hidden areas of our heart into the light of God, letting the Holy Spirit examine and correct us until our heart is completely toward God, and desires and chooses only God.
[137]  Since God and His will are inseparable, and since God dwells in our spirit as the Holy Spirit, our first practice in understanding God's will must be the exercise of our spirit to touch the feeling of the Holy Spirit in the depths of our spirit.
[138]  However, if we exercise our spirit to reject our feeling and opinion and seek the mind of God in our spirit, we will touch the feeling of God regarding this very matter.
[139]  F. Fellowship with God and Study the Inward Feeling
[140]  A practical understanding of God's will in our daily living demands fellowship with God.
[141]  Those who lack fellowship with God are unable to understand creation and the Bible.
[142]  Therefore, each time we touch a feeling from our fellowship with God, as long as it is not in obvious conflict with the teaching of the Bible, we should believe and accept it as from God.
[143]  Even though, due to our childish condition, we sometimes accept the feeling wrongly, we still have to believe that we are wrong in the hand of God, and God will still keep us.
[144]  To know God's will more fully we need to study the environment.
[145]  We come now to study the third of the four stages in our spiritual life, that is, "Christ living in me," or, the experience of "the stage of the cross."
[146]  If a Christian, after he consecrates himself to the Lord, deals thoroughly with all unrighteousness, unholiness, and the feelings of the conscience, and has certain experiences in obeying the teaching of the anointing and understands God's will, then the Lord will lead him to accept the dealings of the cross.
[147]  However, not until we consecrate ourselves to the Lord and obey Him in an absolute way, making progress in the Lord and entering into the third stage, do we gradually discover that, in following the Lord, not only do we have problems related to matters outside of us, but also problems of our very being, such as our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution.
[148]  The first experience in the third stage of our spiritual life is dealing with the flesh by the cross.
[149]  As we have mentioned before, dealing with sin can be likened to removing the dirt from a shirt; dealing with the world to removing the colorful prints in the shirt; and dealing with the conscience to removing the minute bacteria from the shirt.
[150]  Usually when we mention the flesh, we think that the flesh is corrupt and wicked, just as mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21.
[151]  Therefore, not only our temper, hatred, or anything against God which originates in us are of the flesh, but the gentleness, love, and even the service to God which originates in us are also of the flesh.
[152]  In the Old Testament God did one specific thing to express His attitude toward the flesh He established circumcision.
[153]  The first man whom God commanded to perform the act of circumcision was Abraham Gen 17 .
[154]  Being dead with Christ is merely a fact which Christ has accomplished for us before God; to us it is still objective.
[155]  There is the need for the Holy Spirit to work in us and execute the fact which Christ has accomplished on the cross; then the dying with Christ will become our subjective experience.
[156]  A very major and basic work of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us is to work into us the fact that Christ has crucified the flesh on the cross.
[157]  C. Seeing That Our Flesh Has Been Crucified with Christ
[158]  When we have really seen the difficulty of the flesh in the light of God and realize that there is absolutely no way for us to deal with the flesh by ourselves, we are totally in despair in ourselves.
[159]  The Holy Spirit will then give us a revelation concerning the deliverance of the cross as mentioned in Romans 6:6, "Our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin."
[160]  The Spirit will show us that this old man of the flesh has been crucified with Christ and that our body of sin has already been done away and has lost its function; then why should we still be under its bondage?
[161]  In Romans 6 it is mentioned again and again that we have died to sin, that we have been released from sin, and that sin can no longer have dominion over us; hence, we have already been freed from sin.
[162]  Some people think that the "crucified with" in this verse means crucified with Christ.
[163]  But if we read the words of the Apostle carefully, we will realize that this means the crucifying of the flesh with "the passions and the lusts thereof."
[164]  Here the Apostle is not dealing with the objective fact that we have been crucified with Christ, but with the subjective experience of crucifying the flesh through the Holy Spirit.
[165]  The main purpose of discerning the correct meaning of this verse is that we may see that in this matter of dealing with the flesh we must bear our responsibility.
[166]  It is not enough that we merely believe our old man has been crucified with Christ; we must take the initiative to crucify the flesh through the Holy Spirit.
[167]  When we realize that our being, the old creation, the old man, has already been dealt with by the cross of Christ, and that this old man is still being lived out again in the flesh, we should let the Holy Spirit apply the cross of Christ to us step by step in our daily life.
[168]  After we pass through the above process, we begin to experience dealing with the flesh.
[169]  We need to apply this experience and dealing to our practical living continuously, allowing the Holy Spirit to execute the putting to death in us, so that in every matter we may have the experience of dealing with the flesh.
[170]  C. Walking according to the Law of the Spirit of Life
[171]  If we apply dealing with the flesh to all our actions, we will eventually walk after the law of the Spirit of life.
[172]  Romans 8 shows us that the overcoming of the flesh is the result of obeying the Holy Spirit.
[173]  Not only will we not sin or err according to the flesh, but we will not even touch spiritual things or serve God in the flesh.
[174]  The fourth point in dealing with the flesh is that we must know the dealing itself.
[175]  The dealing consists of two aspects: the objective fact and the subjective experience.
[176]  The aspect of the objective fact is what God has accomplished for us in Christ, while the subjective experience requires our cooperation with God in the Holy Spirit.
[177]  Once we love the Lord and pursue after Him, we naturally long that we may have a deeper life in the Lord and that the Lord would live in us in a deeper way.
[178]  Because we give Him the opportunity, the ground, and our cooperation, the Holy Spirit within us will enable us to put our flesh to death so that we may live the life God wants us to live and do what God wants us to do.
[179]  With regard to the experience of dealing with the flesh, there is more dealing with the corrupted aspect of the flesh among the brothers and sisters, but too little with the good aspect of the flesh.
[180]  We all have a natural concept concerning the flesh; naturally, we only know the corrupted flesh.
[181]  If we have learned the deeper lesson of the experience of dealing with the flesh, we will feel that even though we did not lose our temper, but on the contrary were good to others, helped them and even prayed with them, yet, if these things were not done in the Holy Spirit, it was but some good deeds of ourselves.
[182]  Now we come to see the matter of dealing with self.
[183]  Let us read John 5:30, "I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."
[184]  From this verse we learn that it is the same with the Lord Jesus as it is with us in the self being expressed in the form of opinion.
[185]  First, the Lord said here that He can of Himself do nothing; then He said that He does not seek His own will.
[186]  Now that we have clearly seen the definition of self, we need to see the difference in seven related items: the old man, "I," the soul life, the flesh, the temper, the self, and the natural constitution.
[187]  If we wish to pursue the experience of the cross, we should know the definition and differentiation of these seven items very clearly, because these are the objects of the dealing of the cross.
[188]  If we have seen the fact that our old man has been crucified, then in our daily living, whenever we discover the expressing of our own ideas or opinions, we must let the Holy Spirit work the death of the cross upon these ideas and opinions to put them to death.
[189]  C. Applying the Crucifixion of Christ to Our Opinions
[190]  Once we know that our old man has been crucified and done away with in Christ, and once we realize that opinions and ideas are the expression of the old man, we naturally will not allow the old man to express itself again in opinions.
[191]  All this has been done by the Lord for us, but on our part we need the Holy Spirit to open our eyes that we may see not only that the cross of Christ has put the Lord to death, but that at the same time our old man has been crucified and finished there.
[192]  APPLYING THE EXPERIENCE OF DEALING WITH SELF A. In the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[193]  Though we understand the crucifying of the old man and know that our opinions are the expression of self, yet if we do not live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, it is but an empty doctrine and does not afford any practical experience.
[194]  If we do not live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and yet try to deal with self, such exercise is exactly like the strenuous efforts practiced by the Buddhists, Hindus, and Chinese moralists; it is not a spiritual experience.
[195]  If one who loves God has a pliable will, and he is willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will bring him deeper and deeper into the cross and put his self thoroughly to death.
[196]  This applies to the fall of the human race when Satan tempted Eve in the beginning.
[197]  We now come to the eleventh experience of life dealing with the natural constitution.
[198]  We have defined the natural constitution as that which pertains to human ability, capability, wisdom, and cleverness, because all these are derived from our natural life and not from the resurrection life of God.
[199]  The same principle applies to our understanding of God's will.
[200]  This kind of person has his own mind, wisdom, and thoughts, yet he does not do things according to himself, for himself, or depending upon himself; he is used only according to God, for God, and depending upon God.
[201]  If we apply it to the flesh, it is the dealing with the flesh; if we apply it to our opinion, it is the dealing with self; and if we apply it to our ability and capability, it is the dealing with the natural constitution.
[202]  Dealing with self and dealing with the natural constitution are the deeper experiences in the stage of the cross.
[203]  A person whose self has been denied and whose natural constitution has been broken before God is weakened and decreased; hence, Christ increases in him.
[204]  Not only is this a great crisis in his spiritual life and service, but it is in itself a very serious matter in the eyes of God.
[205]  How can we from the shallow experience of the outer court enter into the deep experience of the holy of holies?
[206]  Therefore, this type shows us that our being must be rent and our self and natural constitution broken; then shall we be able to leave our shallow condition and enter into the depth of the spirit; then shall we have fellowship with God face to face and live in God's presence, that is, to live in God.
[207]  God employs a long period of time and a lengthy journey to lead us, "the Jacobs" who have found favor before God and "the Israelites" who have been redeemed, to the end that all the items of our flesh, self-opinion, and natural constitution might be revealed one by one in our practical experience; then one by one He puts them to death for us.
[208]  Likewise, we as Christians today must pay the price, forsake the world, pursue the Lord, bear the testimony of God, serve God daily, and go on with Him; then the incident at Taberah Num 11:1-3 , the rebellion of Korah and Dathan, and Miriam's not submitting to authority, plus numerous other mixed conditions in us of which we are not aware, will gradually be exposed.
[209]  CHAPTER TWELVE ACCEPTING THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[210]  Now we will consider the twelfth experience in our spiritual life accepting the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[211]  In God's Word, much is said about the Holy Spirit as the anointing, such as the leading of the Holy Spirit, the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, the strengthening of the Holy Spirit, and our need to live in the Holy Spirit, walk according to the Holy Spirit, and bear fruit through the Holy Spirit, etc. However, the Bible says very little in a literal way about the discipline of the Holy Spirit; indeed, it contains no such phrase.
[212]  The purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit toward us can be divided into three aspects: chastisement, education, and breaking.
[213]  For example, we would find it rather difficult to apply an additional coat of paint to a small table which already has been painted with a thick layer of glossy paint.
[214]  When God desires to penetrate us by the Holy Spirit, we who are whole according to nature, like the shiny egg shell, need to be cracked as a coordinating process for the penetrating work of God.
[215]  For the educational purpose, the discipline of the Holy Spirit is given not only to break us so that the element of God may mingle more with us, but also to cook us, because we are so raw and wild by nature.
[216]  The third purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is the tearing down or breaking.
[217]  We have repeatedly said that the work of God in us is for the central purpose of mingling and building His element into us.
[218]  The position of the discipline of the Holy Spirit in the entire work of God is firstly outward, not inward.
[219]  We have said that the positive work of God through the Holy Spirit is the inner anointing, guidance, enlightening, strengthening, etc. The Bible speaks much about these aspects, which are all glorious, sweet, and of chief importance in the eyes of God.
[220]  V. THE SCOPE OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[221]  C. Confess Regarding the Point of the Purpose to Be Dealt With
[222]  Once we ascertain that the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit in dealing with us is a certain problem, we should confess it seriously before the Lord with regard to that particular problem.
[223]  Were it not for that problem and difficulty we would have no need for the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[224]  Since the Holy Spirit arranges the environment to discipline us concerning a specific point, we must realize that it is in that specific point that we have a problem before God, either because we are stubborn or proud, stiff-necked or disobedient, not willing to pay the price, or not willing to deny self; it is either one thing or the other which must be removed or broken, dealt with or torn down.
[225]  The discipline of the Holy Spirit is not only given to deal with us or to break us, but also to test us.
[226]  Many times our spirit is not upright or correct because we have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[227]  Moreover, it is only when we have dealt adequately with our spirit that we can accept from deep within the dealing of the Holy Spirit.
[228]  In God's original arrangement for man, He placed the spirit of man above his soul and body in order that man might live by the spirit, on one hand exercising the spirit to contact God and be ruled by Him, and on the other hand exercising the spirit to control his whole being.
[229]  Nevertheless, the spirit of man is surrounded by the flesh, self-opinion, and the natural constitution, plus the fact that man is so accustomed to live by these; therefore God requires that man, through the killing effect of the Lord's cross, put all these to death, dealing with them and breaking them, so that there will be some crack or opening for the spirit to come forth.
[230]  The passage of the spirit can be summed up as the soul and the body, but when studied minutely it can be divided into the purpose of the heart, the motive, the aim, the intention, the heart, the mood of the heart, the will, and the flesh, etc. The purpose of the heart has something to do with the heart, while the motive and intention, etc., can be either in the heart or in the soul.
[231]  Since the defilement of the spirit is due to the passage of the spirit which includes the purpose of the heart, motive, aim, intention, etc. , then dealing with the spirit is not dealing with the spirit itself, but with the passage of the spirit, that is, with the purpose of the heart, motive, aim, intention, etc. Whenever we are about to act or speak, not only do we need to inquire whether what we are about to do is right or wrong, good or bad, but we must also discern whether or not our inner intention is clean, our motive pure, and our aim wholly for God.
[232]  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEALING WITH THE SPIRIT AND DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE
[233]  Likewise, it is because the Lord has done away with our old man on the cross, and our flesh, temper, self, natural constitution, and all other mixtures as well, that we can employ this fact as a basis upon which to deal with our flesh, temper, self-will, natural ability, and all the mixtures in the passages of our spirit.
[234]  We now come to the fourteenth experience of life, which is being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[235]  When considering this matter of being filled with the Holy Spirit or the work of the Holy Spirit on us, we must be very clear that, as far as the Bible is concerned, it is divided into two periods the Old Testament and the New Testament; and as far as our experience is concerned, it is divided into two great aspects the outward and the inward.
[236]  Although in the Old Testament this action of the Spirit of God coming upon man to move him to work for God occurred quite frequently, yet in principle at that time the Spirit of God had not entered into man nor dwelt in man and mingled with man.
[237]  C.In the Old Testament the Spirit of God was employed by man, whereas in the New Testament the Holy Spirit is the Lord in man.
[238]  Based upon the above two points we can conclude that the Spirit of God which descended upon man in the Old Testament did not come in His Person to be the Lord for man to obey, but as a power to be employed by man.
[239]  Therefore, under the dispensation of the New Testament, we can not only rely upon the Holy Spirit as the outward power to perform the work committed to us by God, but through the Holy Spirit as life within, we can mingle with God as one.
[240]  People in Old Testament times did not experience the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but only the outward descending of the Spirit of God.
[241]  Since the history of the human race began, although many had experienced the descending of the Spirit of God upon them, moving them to do the work of God, there was not one among them who had the Holy Spirit indwelling him, mingling with him, and becoming his life and nature.
[242]  Since the Lord Jesus was the first to experience the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and since He is the Head of the New Testament believers as well as of the church, then the manner of the Holy Spirit's work on New Testament believers and the church is the same as that which was upon Him; the Holy Spirit works on the Body in the same manner as He worked on the Head.
[243]  Immediately after the Lord Jesus, the Apostles were the first group to experience the Holy Spirit.
[244]  In order to be filled with the Holy Spirit, we need first to know that, as far as the objective fact is concerned, both aspects the inward and the outward have been accomplished by God.
[245]  God does not have to give the Lord Jesus to man again to be crucified for man; neither does God have to send down the Holy Spirit again to fill man within and without.
[246]  Then we must deal with sin, the world, the flesh, our self-opinion, and our natural ability, to the end that we may completely empty ourselves of these, allowing none of them to have any more place in us, but rather allowing the Holy Spirit to gain all the ground in us.
[247]  We have previously said that the Spirit of God descending upon man as power is for empowering, that man may be made competent for the work committed to him by God and that he may be used by God.
[248]  The reason the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord on the day He was baptized was that the Lord was testifying to heaven and earth through baptism that from that day He was going to be officially used by God.
[249]  At the time when people in the world cared neither for God's will nor God's work, but lived only for themselves, Jesus of Nazareth stood forth before the whole universe, declaring that He desired to live for God, to be used by God, and to work for God.
[250]  Although each one when saved has to some extent the move of the Holy Spirit and a desire to work for God, nevertheless, because they are not willing to give themselves up to be used by God, they suppress the Holy Spirit's move and their desire.
[251]  On the other hand, we need to give ourselves more to the Lord to be used by Him, so that the Holy Spirit may descend upon us richly, giving us power and gifts; then we can serve God, deal with God's enemy, and bring in the Kingdom of God!
[252]  Now we will consider the fourth stage of our spiritual experience.
[253]  After we have passed through the previous stages, all difficulties in us relating to sin, the world, the offense in the conscience, the flesh, the self, and the natural constitution having been dealt with and purged, there remains in us nothing but God.
[254]  God now has gained absolute ground in us, and our whole being within and without is entirely filled with the Holy Spirit.
[255]  Everyone who wants to engage in spiritual warfare must first know the Body.
[256]  On one hand, we say that if we want to fight the spiritual warfare and deal with God's difficulty, we must first deal with our flesh, self, and soul life, thus solving our own difficulties; on the other hand, we say that in order to fight the battle, we must first know the Body, and in order to know the Body and live in the Body, we must first deal with our flesh, self, and soul life.
[257]  God's plan from eternity is to get a group of people to share His life, bear His image, and be united with Him as one.
[258]  In Ephesians 1:23 we read that the Church is the Body of Christ.
[259]  In summary, we see five points in God's plan: a God desired to work Himself into man and unite Himself with man so that man would resemble Him. b God is in His Son.
[260]  Therefore, when He wanted to work Himself into man, He wanted to work His Son into man; when He wanted man to be united with Himself, He wanted man to be united with His Son. c The people whom God wanted to be united with His Son are the brethren of His Son, those who share the sonship with His Son and together with His Son express Him. d This group of people is the Bride of His Son, a part of His Son, taken out from His Son. e This Bride not only comes out from His Son, but is presented to His Son to become the Body of His Son.
[261]  The third proof of our knowing the Body is the recognition of authority.
[262]  But if we have seen that God wants a Body, and that we, being members of this Body, can never go on alone for once we are alone we are disjointed , we will learn to recognize authority, keep our position in the Body, and coordinate with all the brothers and sisters.
[263]  If in the first three stages we have passed through various kinds of dealings, being earnest and thorough, especially in dealing with the flesh, the self-opinion, and the natural constitution, then the Holy Spirit within will lead us in a very natural manner to know our respective order in the Body of Christ, causing our life and service to be full of the flavor of the coordination of the Body.
[264]  We now come to see the sixteenth experience of life, which is knowing the ascension.
[265]  Although, when we were saved, we were saved from under judgment into the forgiveness of sins, and were made alive from the condition of death and obtained God's life, yet neither can the forgiveness of sins nor the obtaining of life be considered as the position of our salvation.
[266]  Ephesians 2:5-6 tells us that "when we were dead through our trespasses, God made us alive together with Christ and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places."
[267]  The position of ascension which we have obtained rests not only on the fact of ascension which God has accomplished in Christ, but also on the life of ascension which we have obtained within us.
[268]  Many Christians today are greatly concerned with the problem of power.
[269]  But the Lord has saved us not only to the state of possessing power, but also to the place of having authority.
[270]  We obtain the position of ascension the moment we are saved.
[271]  In the previous chapter we have seen the matter of knowing the ascension; now we will go on immediately to see the experience of reigning.
[272]  Therefore, if we want to reign for God, not only do we need to be in the position of ascension, but we must also keep the position of order given to us by God that is, to submit to the authority to which we should submit.
[273]  When God created man in the beginning, God gave man authority to have dominion over all the creatures in the sea, in the air, and upon earth.
[274]  At that time, man was submitting to God's authority; hence, God's authority was with him, and all creatures were made to submit to man.
[275]  But once man fell and rebelled against God, unwilling as he was to submit to God's authority, he then lost the authority of God.
[276]  This means that we must positively and actively reign for God, ruling over all things.
[277]  Concerning the fourth stage of spiritual life we have seen the first three experiences: knowing the Body, knowing the ascension, and reigning.
[278]  Therefore, in order to engage in spiritual warfare, we must first know the opposition between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan.
[279]  Since warfare exists between the kingdoms of God and Satan, all the spiritual work we are doing for God, whatever form it may take, as long as it touches the things of the spiritual realm, is in nature a warfare.
[280]  Second Corinthians 10:3-5 says, "Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds ; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ."
[281]  The purpose of administering the church is to deliver the church out of the power of darkness, to let God gain the place of rule in the church, to let the name of God be exalted in the church, to let His will be done in the church, and to let the glory of God be increasingly manifested in the church.
[282]  When we experience spiritual warfare in a practical way, there are several basic principles which we must keep: A. Not Using Fleshly Weapons
[283]  Therefore, when we in our experience have reached the position of ascension and are able to reign, that will be the time we can fight for the kingdom of God, recover the lost earth for God, and bring in the kingdom of God.
[284]  The third principle of spiritual warfare is that we must use spiritual weapons.
[285]  We shall now study the nineteenth lesson concerning life, which is also the last experience of life being full of the stature of Christ.
[286]  Concerning the content, being full of the stature of Christ means that we are full of the life and nature of Christ.
[287]  When a person arrives at the full stature of Christ, he is in the same position as Christ, not only in objective fact, but also in experience.
[288]  Another issue of one who is full of the stature of Christ is that of dealing, together with Christ, with the enemy.
