   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT EXCELLENT CHARACTERISTICS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:5-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we began to consider certain excellent characteristics of the Christian life, pointing out that in 4:5-9 we have the expression of a life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From verses 5 and 6 we saw that such a life exhibits forbearance, but has no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message, a continuation of the preceding one, we shall go on to see six governing aspects of a life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE REST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul gives us these governing aspects in verse 8: For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. Whatever Is True</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first governing aspect of a life that lives Christ is whatever is true.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word true here means truthful ethically, not merely true in matter of fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the expression of a life that lives Christ there can be no falsehood, no lying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everything we do or say must be truthful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one who lives Christ should practice falsehood of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A life that is the expression of Christ is a truthful one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Whatever Is Honorable</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second aspect is whatever is honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word rendered honorable means venerable, worthy of reverence, noble, grave 1 Tim 3:8, 11; Titus 2:2 , implying the idea of dignity, which inspires and invites reverence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A life that lives Christ will be honorable, noble, grave, solid, weighty, and dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not think that only older people should be weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the young people, even the teen-agers, should also have dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even a young brother in junior high school should have dignity, for he has God within him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is a vessel containing God as his worth, weight, and dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To have dignity is not to act important; it is to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A jewelry box containing a diamond ring has dignity not because of the box itself, but because of the diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the diamond in the box which gives dignity to the box.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In like manner, we are a vessel containing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we live Him, we shall have true dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When others see us bearing such a dignity, they will have a deep respect for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The dignity implied in the Greek word for honorable always inspires a profound respect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This dignity is the second governing aspect of the expression of a life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Whatever Is Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 8 Paul also speaks of whatever is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This refers to what is right not just before God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Doing what is right is another governing aspect related to the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. Whatever Is Pure</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word pure in the expression whatever is pure means single in intention and action, without any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be pure in this way is to have no pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Purity is also a governing aspect of the life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>E. Whatever Is Lovely</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet another governing aspect of such a life is whatever is lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word lovely means lovable, agreeable, endearing.</S>
