   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MIND SET ON THE THINGS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After this there is the third item, that is, the mind set on the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The things which you are praising for become your enjoyment and become a base, a ground, for you to set your entire soul on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to set your mind on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Don t set your mind on your checking account or on your new car.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes after brothers and sisters have bought a new car, their mind has really been set on the car for at least a month.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They muse on the car.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They like to look at it and to touch it and to consider it and to wash it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is to set your mind on a car.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to turn your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you are washing your car, forget about the car.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Set your mind upon the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the wrapping up of all the things of God with your inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Firstly, your spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit of God; then it is wrapped up with all these things of God concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If your mind is set upon all these wonderful things of God concerning Christ, you would surely be a wonderful person filled up with Christ and saturated with all the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are the three items of the second group.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE LAW, THE SPIRIT, AND THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now let us come back to the first group of items.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first group is very mysterious and even somewhat abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All three of these are somewhat abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are not so substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ONE PERSON IN THREE ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I must point out to you again that all these three things are one Person in three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, the Spirit is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should not consider the Spirit as a power or as an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must consider the Spirit as the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same principle the law and the life also must be a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit is a Person, the life is a Person, and the law is also this same Person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is one Person with three aspects within you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One Person is in you with three titles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is called the Spirit, He is called the life, and He is also called the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are not three Persons, but one Person in three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit must be the Spirit of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ, the Second of the Trinity is life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Epistles we also are told that Christ is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No doubt life here refers to the Second of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What about the law?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The natural law always brings us to the source.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is a law, that natural law goes to the source.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who is the source?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So the Father is here as the source of the spiritual, natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Father is the source of this automatic, working law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So with the law of the Spirit of life, we have the Father, the Spirit, and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have these Three working in us as the Spirit and as the law and as the life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Triune God as a complete Person is working within us as the law, as the Spirit, and as life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>APPLYING THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How can we apply this?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Don t forget that the law is just the Triune God Himself working within us in an automatic way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Within us there is a kind of work going on automatically, not by activity and not by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we come into this building and need lights, we go to the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we touch the switch, the light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we keep the switch on all the time, light will be shining all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not an activity, nor is it an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is according to the working of the law of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The electricity was installed into the building according to the law of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is something that regulates the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That something is invisible, abstract, and mysterious, but it is so real.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The electricians have to install the things properly because they have a law to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Actually, what is installed into the building is not only electricity, but also a law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>An electrical law has been installed into this building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If someone fulfills the law of electricity, the electricity in the building works, not by activity nor by accident, but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our Triune God today within us is such a law.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes Christians trust too much in their prayer in a superstitious way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is like someone coming into the building who does not know the law of electricity and does not know where the switch is.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>So he kneels down and prays and fasts and does not sleep for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He prays in this way, Lord, You are almighty; You are omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Lord, You can make this room full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lord, do it!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some put their trust in this kind of superstitious prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Such a prayer could never cause the room to be full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no need to pray like this.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You just need to go to the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Within seconds light will be shining everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is not a miracle; this is the working out of the invisible, untouchable law.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>My burden is to help you to realize that such a thing is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How wonderful that such a thing is in you!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now I would ask, Are you living?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Recently I told a brother that the pray-reading and the calling on the name of the Lord and the singing of the hymns are being somewhat wrongly used.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You think when you call on the name of the Lord Jesus at the top of your voice, that is living.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But that is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then you might argue that we have printed and published some messages saying that you need to call on the Lord s name as loudly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But you have to read the context of these messages to understand what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Suppose you are always a quiet person.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To such a person I would say if you are going to get the Spirit, you must call on the name of the Lord loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You must cry!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>That message was published to this kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After you began to shout loudly, another message came out encouraging you to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Loudness is not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now I would tell you that the Spirit is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You don t need to beat the switches nor do you need to pray loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Learn to be quiet to touch the inner invisible switch.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Sometimes the more the young people were shouting, the more they were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The more they were shouting, the more the life was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The shoutings, the callings, the pray-readings, the singings became a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It was not the automatic working of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You have to realize that within you there is such a law.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is a law like the law of digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After you eat your meal you don t need to kneel down and pray concerning the digestion of your food.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In fact, if you pray in this way you might get stomach trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After a meal you had better simply take a short walk.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You don t need to pray concerning your digestion because within your stomach there is the law of digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Likewise, within your spiritual being there is a law that works all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This law works within you automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This law is nothing less than the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>To have your spirit mingled with God s Spirit is a great matter, but to have such a law working in your inner being is something even greater.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This law is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Father as the source is working within you as a law.</S>
