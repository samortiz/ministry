   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>15.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Tripartite Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometime before 1925 Brother Nee saw man's three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, he wrote The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among all the Chinese writings of Christians, I do not believe that there has ever been a book written with such a clear vision concerning the spirit, soul, and body of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The main point of the truth concerning the tripartite man is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>16.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sanctification by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also before 1925 Brother Nee saw the truth concerning sanctification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He pointed out that John Wesley's teaching of holiness was actually not holiness but the desire for sinless perfection, human perfection without any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He also pointed out what the Brethren had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They pointed out what the Lord said in Matthew 23 concerning the temple sanctifying the gold and the altar sanctifying the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The common gold was made holy positionally by changing its position from a common place to a holy one v. 17 . When the gold was in the temple, it was sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord also pointed out that the altar sanctifies the gift v. 19 . The common animals offered on the altar were sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a positional sanctification by changing the gift's location from a common place to a holy one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Brethren also pointed out that the food we eat is sanctified through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is according to 1 Timothy 4:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Brethren saw the truth concerning positional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Nee went on to show us that sanctification is not only positional but also dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The dispositional change that takes place from sanctification is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His dispositional sanctification the Lord saturates us with Himself, adding Himself as the new element into our being to transform us into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>17.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Inner Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through Brother Nee's ministry, we were brought into the vision and experience of the inner life in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mystics in the seventeenth century saw something concerning the inner life, but they did not see as much as the Lord has shown us today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>18.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of the church's degradation, many Christians have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the Lord calls some to be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This truth is seen in the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the degradation of the church, the Lord sounds out His call for some of His lovers to be overcomers.</S>
