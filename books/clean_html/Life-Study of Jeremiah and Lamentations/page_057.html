<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Word Spoken by the Prophet<br>for the People of Israel</H2><P>In 10:19-25 we have a word spoken by the prophet for the people of Israel. In verse 19 Jeremiah speaks about his hurt, wound, and affliction. In verse 21 he says that the shepherds, who are stupid, have not sought Jehovah and therefore have not prospered. All their flock is scattered. In verses 24 and 25 he spoke to Jehovah, saying, "Correct me, O Jehovah, but in measure, / Not in Your anger lest You bring me to nothing. / Pour out Your wrath on the nations / Who do not know You/And upon the families/Who do not call on Your name;/For they have consumed Jacob, yes, consumed him and brought him to an end,/And they have made his habitation desolate."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. JEHOVAH'S FEELING CONCERNING<br>ISRAEL'S SUFFERING OF HIS CORRECTION</H2><P>In chapter nine we see not only Jehovah's correction to Israel, His hypocritical worshippers, but also His feeling concerning Israel's suffering of His correction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking Up a Weeping and Wailing<br>for the Mountains and a Lamentation<br>for the Pastures of the Wilderness</H2><P>Jehovah said that for the mountains He would take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness, a lamentation. He would do this because they had been burned up so that no one passed through, and the sound of cattle was not heard. Both the birds of the sky and the beasts had fled and gone (9:10). Then Jehovah said, "I will make Jerusalem heaps, / A habitation of jackals; / And I will make the cities of Judah / A desolation without inhabitant" (v. 11). This indicates that although Jehovah was punishing Israel, He was still sympathetic toward them. On the one hand, He was punishing Israel; on the other hand, He was sympathizing with His punished people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Saying That the Mourning Women<br>Should Come and Take Up a Wailing for Us</H2><P>"Thus says Jehovah of hosts, / Consider, and call for the mourning women to come, / And send for the skillful women to come; / Let them hasten and take up a wailing for us, / That our eyes may shed tears / And our eyelids may pour forth water. / For a voice of wailing / Was heard from Zion: / How we are ruined! / We are utterly put to shame! / For we have forsaken the land / Because they have cast down our dwellings" (vv. 17-19). Here Jehovah proposed that the mourning women, professional wailers, come and wail "for us." In these verses the words us and our indicate that Jehovah joined Himself to the suffering people and was one with them in their suffering. The sympathetic God who punished was also among His punished people. He joined Himself to them and stayed with them. Eventually, those who wailed were wailing not only for Israel but also for Jehovah. Jehovah Himself was weeping in sympathy for His people. He was like a mother who, while spanking her child, weeps along with her child.</P>
