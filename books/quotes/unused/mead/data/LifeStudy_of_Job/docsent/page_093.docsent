   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THIRTY THE FINAL OUTCOME, UNDER GOD'S CONSUMMATION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PROGRESSIVE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE NARRATION OF THE STORY OF JOB Scripture Reading: Job 42</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider chapter forty-two of the book of Job This chapter reveals the final outcome, under God's consummation, of the progressive divine revelation in the narration of the story of Job</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. JOB GAINING GOD IN HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND ABHORRING HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear,/But now my eye has seen You;/Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent /In dust and ashes" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that Job gained God in his personal experience in addition to knowing God in his vain knowledge by tradition and that he abhorred himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Seeing God equals gaining God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To gain God is to receive God in His element, in His life, and in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, this not only makes us one with God it even makes us a part of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I prefer not to use the phrase "one with" in describing our relationship with God because to be made a part of God, to be constituted with God in His life and nature, is more than being one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We see God that we may be constituted with God, yet we do not have any share in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified people will see God's face Rev 22:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Seeing God transforms us 2 Cor 3:18 , because in seeing God we receive His element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we receive God, a new element comes into us, and the old element is discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This metabolic process is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To see God is to be transformed into the glorious image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This makes us a part of God that we may express God in His life and represent Him in His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Job said not only that He saw God but also that he abhorred himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to our experience, the more we see God and love God, the more we abhor ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we know God, the more we deny ourselves.</S>
