   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ITS DIMENSIONS, ITS TEMPLE, AND ITS LIGHT Scripture Reading: Rev 21:15-16, 22-24a; 22:5; Deut 33:27; Psa 90:1 ITS DIMENSIONS The Number Twelve</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The dimensions of the New Jerusalem are stressed in Revelation 21:15-16.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem and that the height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits which is twelve times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 21:16 tells us that the length, breadth, and height of the city are twelve thousand stadia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Twelve thousand, of course, is one thousand times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ten is a number of completion in the Scriptures, but it is not as complete as a hundred or even one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Psalmist tells us that a day in the Lord s courts is better than a thousand Psa 84:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The number one thousand is a complete unit, and in God s eyes one thousand years is equal to one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that one thousand is the ultimate completion in God s figuration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God s administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy of Holies</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The measurement of the New Jerusalem shows us that it is a cube with three equal dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the entire New Jerusalem is straight, perfect, and complete, without any defect, bias, obliqueness, or shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and the temple, are equal in length, breadth, and height Exo 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, that the length, the breadth, and the height of the New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Measured with a Golden Reed</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The city is also measured with a golden reed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reed is for measuring, and measuring signifies to take possession Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>40:5; Zech 2:1-2; Rev 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since gold signifies the divine nature of God, the golden reed signifies that the measuring of the city, its gates and its wall, is according to God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anything that does not match the divine nature of God does not belong to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The whole city, with its gates and wall, can pass the measuring and testing of the divine nature of God; hence, it is fitting for God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A reed is not that strong, but the nature of the measuring reed for the New Jerusalem is golden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The holy city is not measured according to man s concept, idea, philosophy, or qualification, but according to God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Square City</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The city lying foursquare Rev 21:16a , signifies that the New Jerusalem is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight, without any obliqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s divine nature is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God s divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On this earth today there is no government which is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every government is full of defects, bias, and crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In God s eternal, divine administration, however, there is nothing but perfection and completion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The governments of this earth are full of politicians, but in the church we have to learn one thing do not play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church, when we say yes we mean yes, and when we say no we mean no 2 Cor 1:17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we say black we mean black, and when we say white we mean white.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church there is no gray color.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The holy city is not a round city but a square city.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be round means to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you told me that I was a round person, I would feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need to be square persons who are so frank, straight, and open.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The city s being equal in three dimensions as a cube means that the city is perfect to the uttermost with no defects, bias, or obliqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The city s being square has a very spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here there is no politics, no crookedness, and here is God s frankness, faithfulness, and openness.</S>
