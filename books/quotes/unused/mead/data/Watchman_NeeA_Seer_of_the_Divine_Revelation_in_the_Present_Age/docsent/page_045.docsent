   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was born and raised in a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I considered myself a good person who had no need of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During my first year in the Girls' Normal College in Wuchang, I experienced some fear of sinning against God, although at that time I was not sure there was a God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After passing through some years of schooling and acquiring more knowledge, I became careless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later I taught in a school in Tientsin, established by a relative.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My maternal uncle was a believer, and I respected his character and learning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet I considered him somewhat superstitious.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In March 1918 while sailing on the Yangtze River, I was enjoying the scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time I realized that there must be a Supreme Being superior to mankind, who was wise and almighty, as mentioned in Romans 1:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day one of my colleagues, a Miss Cheng, opened her Bible and called my attention to Romans 2:28-29.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She also read Romans 3:29.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time I realized that there was a God and that He was also my God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the end of April, Miss Cheng invited me to a luncheon held at the home of Miss Mary A. Leaman, an American missionary, where I discovered that my friend had been praying for me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After lunch Miss Leaman admonished me to believe in the Lord and asked me to kneel down and pray with her.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From then on I read a few verses of the Bible every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day I knelt down and prayed that if God was true and if the Bible was true, He must enable me to believe the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After rising up, I was able to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I then desired to learn how to pray and how to sing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I secretly asked one of my Christian students to copy the words and music of a hymn for me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How wonderful when I sang the first stanza of the hymn: "O happy day that fixed my choice on Thee, my Savior and my God!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I determined to believe that Jesus was my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I sang the chorus, "When Jesus washed my sins away," and rejoiced exceedingly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I felt that God had told me that Jesus had washed my sins away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On that day I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later the light of God came to me again.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From that time on, whenever I remembered having wronged anyone, I would confess it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, in my daily life and in my inward desire, there was a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day I read Luke 12:8.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I determined to confess before men that I believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, I simply did not have the nerve to confess the Lord before men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I struggled with this for a long time and was greatly troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day I heard a voice within me saying, "Are you willing to forsake everything and follow Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At first I did not know what it meant, but later I knew.</S>
