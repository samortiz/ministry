   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Holiness as a Constitution</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God not only gives us His holiness as a gift, but He also wants us to partake of His holiness through His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wants us to be constituted with His holiness; He wants to wrought holiness into our being little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Carnal persons like us require years of discipline from God before His holy character and nature can become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need all kinds of blows, situations, guidance, frustrations, urgings, and chastisement before we can partake of God's holy character.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a great matter!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God does not merely give us holiness as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This holiness must be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has to constitute us with His holiness!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is one distinctive feature of salvation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God first gives us something, and then He works the same thing into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He constitutes us with the same thing little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we have both aspects, we have full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One is a gift from Christ, and the other is a constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a distinctive feature of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One is a gift, and the other is a constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among all the crucial things in the New Testament, there is this clear statement: God is making us partakers of His holiness through His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PEACEABLE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>YIELDED THROUGH DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 11 says, "Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here the apostle draws special attention to the words at the present time and afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a fact that one does not feel happy at the time of discipline, but grievous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not think that suffering is wrong when you experience God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Discipline is surely a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It says rather that the cross is affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The cross brings us suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord despised the shame for the joy set before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy; the cross is not a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is always a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not wrong to grieve and feel afflicted when we are disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we must learn obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only through obedience can we partake of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Discipline indeed is not a matter of joy "at the present time."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, it is grief to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not surprising; it is in fact quite normal for us to feel this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our Lord did not consider the trials a matter of joy when He passed through them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, we can make it a matter of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter said that we can exult in various trials 1 Pet 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, they are a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other hand, we can reckon them to be a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How we feel is one thing, and how we reckon is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can feel grieved, but at the same time, we can reckon it to be a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A. Yielding the Peaceable Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A child of God should fix his eyes not on the present but on the future.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Pay attention to this sentence: "Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not look at the suffering you are going through now.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, look at the resulting peaceable fruit of righteousness.</S>
