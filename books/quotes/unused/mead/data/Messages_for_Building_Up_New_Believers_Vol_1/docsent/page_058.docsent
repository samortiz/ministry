   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Believing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A condition on the positive side for having prayer answered is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Faith is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without faith, prayer is ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The story in Mark 11 speaks loudly of the need for faith in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus said, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them v. 24 . We must believe when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we believe that we have received what we are praying for, we will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope that as soon as a person has received the Lord, even a week after his conversion, he will know what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord said, Believe that you have received them, and you will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not say, Believe that you will receive them but, Believe that you have received them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should believe that we have received what we asked for, and we will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The believing that the Lord speaks of here is followed by its predicate you have received.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Faith is believing that we have received what we have asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians often make the mistake of separating believe from its predicate you have received.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They place it before the expression you will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They pray to the Lord thinking that it is a matter of great faith to believe...and you will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They pray to the Lord that the mountain be taken up and cast into the sea, and they believe that it will be so.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They think that this kind of faith is great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, this is to move believe away from you have received and to place it before you will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible says that we should believe that we have received, not that we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The two are definitely not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only do new believers need to learn this, but even those who have been believers for many years need to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Faith is the assurance that God has answered our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not the conviction that God will answer our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Faith is when we kneel down to pray and say in an instant, Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has answered my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to believe that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person may kneel down and pray and may rise and say, I believe that God will definitely hear my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The expression will definitely hear is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how hard he tries to believe in this way, he will not see any result.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose you pray for a sick person and he says, Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am healed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His temperature may still be high; there may be no change in his symptoms at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But his problem is over because he is clear within himself that he is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if he says, I believe the Lord will surely heal my sickness, he will probably need to try harder to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus said, Believe that you have received them, and you will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not say that you will receive if you believe that you will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you turn this around, it does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen the key?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Genuine faith lies in the phrase It is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Genuine faith is thanking God for having already answered your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to say a few words more about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Consider the matter of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can find some solid examples of faith in Mark s Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are three sentences in the Gospel of Mark which bear special significance to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first relates to the Lord s power, the second to the Lord s will, and the third to the Lord s act.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s Power God Can</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us look at Mark 9:21-23, which says, And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And he said, From childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And Jesus said to him, You say, If You can.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All things are possible to him who believes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The father said to the Lord Jesus, If You can do anything...help us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus repeated his word and said, If You can.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord s if You can is a quotation of the father s if You can.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus was repeating what the father said.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The father said, If You can do anything...help us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus said, If You can.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All things are possible to him who believes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was not a question of if You can, but a question of whether or not he could believe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When man finds himself in difficulty, he is usually full of doubt; he cannot believe in the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the first thing we need to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It may seem at times that the power of the obstacle is greater than the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord Jesus rebuked the father for doubting the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Bible we seldom find the Lord interrupting a person as He did in this case.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It seems that the Lord was angry when He said, If You can.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord rebuked the father when the father said, If You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What the Lord meant was, How can you say, If You can ?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All things are possible to him who believes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is not a matter of if I can, but a matter of whether or not you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How dare you ask if I can!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When God s children pray, they should learn to lift up their eyes and say, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You can.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Mark 2 records the incident of the Lord healing a paralytic.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven v. 5 . Some scribes reasoned in their hearts, saying, Why is this man speaking this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except One, God? v. 7 . In their hearts they thought that only God could forgive sins and that Jesus could not.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They regarded forgiveness of sins as a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But the Lord said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord was showing them that to man it was a question of whether or not one could do it, but to God it was a question of which was easier.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For man, it is impossible for anyone to forgive sins or to ask the paralytic to stand up and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, the Lord showed them that He could forgive sins as well as make the paralytic rise up and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Both forgiving and making the paralytic rise up and walk were easy for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord was showing them that God can.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In our prayer we need to know that God can and that nothing is too difficult for the Lord.</S>
