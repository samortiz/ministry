The first aspect is the meaning of the church; the second, the course of the church; and the third, the organization of the church
The course of the church means the progression of the church, or what we normally call the history of the church
When we speak of the course of the church, we are referring to the origin and the progression of the church, and we must begin with eternity
The church came out from God's eternal plan; therefore, in eternity past, before the creation of all things, God's intention was the church
In other words, even though God wanted the church in eternity past, He did not tell anyone-not even the angels-anything about the church
God created all things in order to build the church; His creation was directed toward the church, and the church was its goal
The Old Testament never directly speaks of the church; rather, it contains only implications and types instead of plain words
Christ's mysterious story is in the church; it can be said that without the church, Christ would no longer be a mystery
God did not make the mystery known to men in the age of Adam, in the age of Abraham, or even in the age of the prophets
Not even Isaiah and the other prophets, who foretold the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, knew about this mystery, the church
In other generations God never made the church known to man 'as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit'
From eternity past through the Old Testament age up until the apostles and prophets of the New Testament, this mystery was hidden
In other words, this mystery was hidden from eternity past until the apostles and prophets received the revelation
Colossians 1:26 says, 'The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints'
We need to make a distinction between these two: the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church
Christ, the Head, is the mystery of God, and all the stories of God are in Christ as the Head and related to Christ
On the other hand, the church, the Body, is the mystery of Christ, and all the stories of Christ are in the church as His Body
All the stories of God are in Christ, the Head; all the mysteries of Christ, the Head, are in the Body, the church
If we would know the mystery, story, and matters of God and man, man and God, then we must know Christ and the church
Christ is a part of the mystery, the first step of the mystery; the church is another part of the mystery, the second step of the mystery
God did not tell anyone; He did not even reveal it to the angels who serve before Him every day, including the archangel Michael
Apart from the characteristics of being eternal, heavenly, and spiritual, the church also has the characteristic of being mysterious
The Lord revealed the church in Matthew 16, because at that time Christ as the mystery of God had been manifested
After Christ was manifested, the mystery of God was no longer hidden, but not until Matthew 16 was this mystery openly known by man
At that time the Lord Jesus was in Caesarea Philippi, and He asked His disciples, 'Who do men say that the Son of Man is'?
In Luke 15 the joy is small; in Matthew 16 God's joy is greater because on that day God's mystery in the universe was known by man
In the original language, blessed and joy are the same word; there is no way to distinguish between blessing and joy
The mystery of God-Christ-was recognized by man; in other words, the first aspect of the mystery was known by man
Only when the apostle Paul wrote the book of Ephesians did this revelation become completely and fully subjective
In Matthew 16 the mystery of God was recognized by man, so the Lord could use the way of prophecy to further reveal the mystery of Christ
The first aspect of the mystery is the mystery of God, which is Christ; this aspect had the first step of revelation in the Old Testament
The church was never clearly revealed in the Old Testament and was not revealed in prophecy until the Lord spoke about it in Matthew 16
Matthew 16:18 is the prophetic revelation of the second aspect of the mystery, which was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost
The revelation of the fulfillment of this aspect of the mystery was not given until Paul wrote the book of Ephesians
In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would build His church, and in Ephesians Paul wrote that the church had come into existence
When we speak of the producing of the church, the fulfillment of the church, however, we must begin with the day of Pentecost
On the day of Pentecost the church was not only in God's thought, but it had actually come out from within God
God clearly showed the church to the universe; therefore, all creation knew that the mystery in God was the church
In the beginning, when God created the heavens, the earth, and all things, all the angels seemed to wonder, 'What kind of story is this?
When God created Adam, called Abraham, and even inspired the prophet Isaiah, no one understood the real meaning of the universe
The angels did not understand, humans did not understand, God's chosen people did not understand, and even God's prophets did not understand
It was not until Matthew 16, when the mysterious, incarnated One was recognized, that the second aspect of the mystery was revealed
On the day of Pentecost however the church was properly produced and the first aspect of the mystery became the second aspect of the mystery
The first aspect of the mystery is the mystery of God, Christ; the second aspect of the mystery is the mystery of Christ, the church
The Son revealed the prophecy because the enlargement of the incarnated Christ, the church, had not yet been fulfilled
After the incarnation at Bethlehem, the mystery of God was manifested among men, but most people saw the mystery without understanding it
The people did not know that they were seeing the enlargement of the mystery of God, which had become the mystery of Christ
The mystery of God was fulfilled at Bethlehem, and the mystery of Christ was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost
Christ is the expression of God, and the church is the expression of Christ; these two are two parts of one mystery
People have not seen that the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation speaks only of this mystery in two aspects
In our living, we do not need to exhort people to have patience; when they see the mystery, they will have patience
Neither do we need to exhort people to love one another; when they see this mystery, they will have love within them
We are not able to be patient and holy or to have love and power in ourselves; everything rests with this mystery
In this way our living our service our work and our administration of the church will be unspeakably high weighty and full of rich content
We absolutely believe and deeply feel that what the Lord wants to do in these last days is to build up the Body of Christ
The church was not only hidden in God in eternity past; it was also revealed in time, produced at Pentecost, and spread on the earth
After the church was produced at Pentecost, it has been constantly spreading for the past two thousand years and has spread everywhere
God's intention is that there would be a church in the universe; He does not want the church to be in only one locality
In other words, the church that God wants is a church in the whole universe and not simply a church in one place
Even though the church has representative manifestations in many different localities, it is universal, not local
The church can be produced in one place, but it is impossible to continue the church in one place forever and force it to grow only there
If a local church does not spread, the nature of that church is too low, and it will lose its universal and eternal character
Not long after the church in Jerusalem was raised up, God caused His children to be scattered to various places by persecution
If we were to say that there was a people on the earth who were closed and sealed up, we would say it was the Jews
Peter was the top apostle who saw the vision of the mystery of God and heard the prophecies of the mystery of Christ
Despite the fact that he received the revelation, he almost brought the church into the limitations of Judaism
It does not matter to us when other localities are in the middle of a great drought as long as our locality has the autumn and spring rains
Because it is not easy to break through the regional concepts within people, the church needs to spread even more
From Acts we see the process of the spreading of the church, and by this we know the church's course on the earth
Samaria lies between Judea and the Gentile lands, and the Samaritans were a racial mixture of Jews and Gentiles
The Samaritans considered themselves to be Jews, but the Jews repeatedly rejected them and did not acknowledge them as Jews
After the Samaritans were saved, the saints in Jerusalem were very surprised and sent the apostles to visit them
When the apostles came and prayed for the Samaritans, the Holy Spirit immediately descended; thus, God Himself confirmed this spread
The Jews never thought that God would call the Gentiles to hear the gospel, receive salvation, and become the church
One day an angel of the Lord came and spoke to Philip, saying, 'Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza'
On the way he saw the chariot of an Ethiopian eunuch, and the Holy Spirit said to Philip, 'Approach and join this chariot'
He not only preached the gospel to the eunuch and led him to believe in the Lord and be saved, but he also baptized him
Church history tells us that from that time onward the gospel spread to Ethiopia in Africa which is the Cush spoken of in the book of Isaiah
In Acts 8 the gospel spread to Africa; however, it was not a white Gentile who received the gospel but a black one, a descendant of Ham
These peoples were despised by the Jews, but the Holy Spirit caused some from both groups to be saved and to become the church
It does not matter whether a race has a low culture, is morally corrupt, or is poor in character; we cannot despise them
After Ananias received the revelation and went to visit Saul, the Holy Spirit descended to confirm this matter
The gospel being preached to the Samaritans was tolerable to the Jews because the Samaritans were a people of mixed Jewish and Gentile blood
Even though Paul had opposed the Lord, he still was of the tribe of Benjamin and considered to be an Israelite
Peter did not have the concept that the church is universal and did not think that the church needed to spread
All kinds of things were in that sheet, both the things that Peter considered clean and the things that Peter considered unclean
God showed Peter this vision because He wanted to tell him You Peter a Jew must be mingled with Cornelius a Gentile to become one church
After Peter and the other six brothers returned to Jerusalem, the saints in Jerusalem still did not understand
The Holy Spirit fell on the members of the household of Cornelius just as He fell on the Jews in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost
On the day of Pentecost he opened the door for the Jews; however, in the house of Cornelius he opened the door for the Gentiles
In order for the church to eliminate its problems, it must spread; once the church spreads, problems will disappear
Their narrow view, prejudiced hearts, regional concepts, and things not up to the standard of the Body were eliminated
On the other hand, we must be clear that the church needs to spread, and we must do our best to raise up churches in every place
The basic principle of the church is that it is eternal and universal; the church must constantly spread on the earth
The fourth was Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch; Manaen was a noble, and not necessarily a Jew
In the church in Antioch there were no distinctions; all these people were not merely in the church but were leaders in the church
Among them were Jews and Gentiles and people of different races; the church in Antioch was a church without divisions
After being sent out by the Holy Spirit, the apostles went to Seleucia and from there they sailed to the island of Cyprus
Even though Cyprus was a Gentile place, the apostles used Jewish synagogues to preach the word when they first arrived
Before the Lord Jesus was born God scattered Jews all over the earth and in every place that there were Jews they built social organizations
Their social organization was centered around the synagogues, just as it centered around the temple in Jerusalem
On the apostle Paul's first trip to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to establish churches among them, he went to Cyprus
If we read Acts carefully, we can see the Holy Spirit's intention to spread the church, not only geographically but also to different races
They could only declare the things that God had done with them and that God had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles
In contrast, any person or place that allows the church to have a way will receive a special blessing from God
We must be saved from all the problems within us to allow the church to spread continually without any limitations
Of all the churches in Macedonia, Philippi was the healthiest and the best; the next best was the church in Thessalonica
He may have wanted to go to Antioch, but before he was able to make the trip, he was arrested by the Jews in Jerusalem
The believers in Judea were Jews who still kept the traditions of Judaism; they looked at the church from a Jewish viewpoint
On the one hand, we should obey the Bible, walk in its light, and comply with the teachings of the truth; this is proper
On the other hand, however, we must ask ourselves whether our Bible knowledge and our light of the truth are dead or living
The brothers and sisters coordinate together in the Body according to God's ordained arrangement, each functioning in his or her place
When there are brothers in the meetings, the sisters should stay in their position and not say anything in the way of teaching
We often say that if we do not have the confirmation of the church, we should not do things alone; we must always act in the Body
If there actually is a need we should not allow our inability to have a confirmation to cause us to delay this is to be living and not dead
We must be willing to be broken and dealt with and also to act in the fellowship of the Body; this is right and proper
If anyone considers the examples in Acts to be dead ordinances for the church to keep, he will kill the church with dead letters
Not only do they take the Old Testament ordinances as ordinances, they also take the principles of the New Testament in this way
Orthodox believers are always in danger of taking the truth as a doctrinal ordinance for the children of God to keep
He was weak and did not rise up to keep the church's testimony of not differentiating between the Jews and the Gentiles
James said, based on the truth, that it was not right to harass the Gentile believers and force them to keep the Jewish laws
Although he was deeply influenced by the Jewish religion, under the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit, he shut Judaism out of the church
Acts 15 opens the eyes of the church and allows the church to escape the bondage of Judaism and the rule of Jerusalem
In his Epistle to the Ephesians he wrote that God wanted to make both Gentiles and Jews into the Body of Christ
After the problem of the Jewish religion was resolved, Paul and Barnabas immediately went out to the Gentile lands to preach the gospel
Barnabas wanted to take Mark to visit the brothers, but Paul felt it was not suitable, and an argument arose between them
As the Holy Spirit works to spread and build up the church Satan follows to damage the Spirits work of spreading and building up the church
Next, Satan instigated some from Jerusalem to bring Jewish thought, law, circumcision, and ordinances into the churches in Gentile lands
When religious ordinances were limiting the spread of the church, God first sent Paul to Jerusalem and won a victory
Satan works in our environment to damage the spread of the church, and he also works among us to damage the building up of the church
Paul wanted to stay in Asia Minor where he had labored previously, but the Holy Spirit forbade him to remain there
The Holy Spirit wanted him to go out to spread the church, but he did not understand the leading of the Holy Spirit
As he vacillated between going forward or going back, a dream came to him in the night telling him to go to Macedonia in Europe
Old relationships, old affections, and old inclinations keep us from going to another place; they make us unable to move
At the end of Acts 15 there is the problem between Barnabas and Paul; in Acts 16 there is a problem within Paul
For the church to spread, the bondage of the Jewish religion, human opinions, and the self with its old concepts must be broken
The first problem is outward, the second is between the workers, and the third comes from the self and old human feelings
In the early days, the church spread to Europe and gained a foothold there because the Holy Spirit broke through in these three areas
The Holy Spirit broke through religious regulations and ceremonies, and He broke through dead letters, human opinions, and human feelings
Consequently, the thought of making such a trip would not be common for Paul; it surely was the work of the Holy Spirit within him
Before the apostles went to Macedonia, there were no churches there, but there was a church in Rome before Paul came
Many Bible scholars acknowledge that the church in Rome came from the Roman pilgrims in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost
On his third journey Paul did not merely fail to spread the churches; he did not carry out the feeling he had concerning the spreading
Paul was sympathetic with the weakness of others and thought that by going to the temple to make some offerings the problems would pass away
On the one hand, he wanted to return to Jerusalem, but on the other hand, he had the inward feeling to go to Rome and Spain
When Paul went to Jerusalem, it seems that it was not according to the Holy Spirit; rather, it was Paul's own idea
It is difficult to say for certain, but it is certain that the work of the Holy Spirit encountered problems with men
In studying church history, we should apply what we learn to ourselves, for today the same problems hinder the spread of the church
As an apostle to the Gentiles, he went backward, returning to his own country on behalf of his kinsmen according to the flesh
With James and all the elders present , Paul was persuaded to participate in things that he had condemned in the book of Galatians
If Paul had not been seized at that time, his offering of sacrifices would have confused the Gentile brothers when they heard about it
Paul did not need to return to Jerusalem, he did not have any great purpose in going there, and there were sufferings awaiting him there
Thank God that He did not allow His children to go back to the Old Testament, nor did He allow the church to be mixed with Judaism
From the time of its destruction, the Bible does not record anything concerning Jerusalem, nor is it given much position in church history
After his weakness in accommodating Judaism led to his arrest, Paul had to use his wisdom in his interrogation by the Sanhedrin
The orthodox Jews immediately took Paul's side, and began to argue with the Sadducees, who did not believe that there is a resurrection
He even might have done more while in Rome, but from this time onward, Paul's movements were greatly restricted
In spite of the inconvenience of his imprisonment, Paul learned a deep lesson and wrote many precious Epistles while in prison
Although he had said that he could be all things to all men , in Acts 21 he was too much in his accommodation of Jewish traditions
In reality, one cannot be all things to all people; if someone worships idols and we follow him in his idol worship, we have gone too far
His practice in this case was against his revelation and against the teachings he had given to the churches; what he did was too much
Suppose a brother goes for a walk with his friend, and when they reach the door of a movie theater his friend wants to go in and see a movie
Paul was weak when he was in Jerusalem because he was not in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit was not with him
Because Paul was always in the hand of the Lord, the Holy Spirit could use His disciplining hand to send him to Rome
The problem of Judaism was considered at the conference in Jerusalem in Acts 15, but it was not completely resolved
The fact that many among them still made vows shows that they were zealous both for the spirit of the law and the ordinances of the law
Old relationships, ordinances, methods, and even truths become entanglements to servants of the Lord and hinder the spread of the church
If all of us move in a straight line without going in circles, the churches would multiply and be built up in every part of Taiwan
Some of the Corinthian believers said that they were of Paul, and others said that they were of Apollos, Cephas, and Christ
The Corinthian believers were critical of the apostle Paul, who took the lead and built up the church among them
In 2 Corinthians 11:13 Paul says, 'Such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ'
The desolation of the church, which began in the church in Corinth, has continued throughout the past two thousand years
If we consider Taipei, we see that in only one section of the city there are more than ten different chapels for church meetings
59, only a little more than twenty years after the church was produced on the day of Pentecost, its condition was already abnormal
He spoke prophetically when he said to the elders in Ephesus After my departure fierce wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock
In Galatians 2:11-14 there was a small problem with Peter, but he was not a fierce wolf coming in among the flock
Timothy does not speak much about the desolation of the church, but 2 Timothy is almost entirely on this subject
Among the Epistles that touch the desolation of the church, the 'second' books have much more to say than the 'first' books
Although Paul had been an apostle for a little more than twenty years, the church was corrupted to such an extent
In speaking of heresies, 2:1 mentions the problem of the false teachers, and verse 15 mentions the problem of Balaam
The other epistles, especially the one to the church in Thyatira, show that the church was degraded to the uttermost
Anything in the Bible concerning the desolation of the church, even a brief reference, needs all of church history for its explanation
When we asked them who they were worshipping, they said they were worshipping the fathers, but before them would be a picture of Peter
The statue of Peter in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome has been kissed so much by worshippers that one of its feet has been worn away
In the church today many people think that the improper, desolate situation of the church is its normal condition
As those who live during the desolation of the church, we need to realize that the desolation manifests our condition
Corinthians 11:19 says, 'For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you'
During the desolation of the church, the different kinds of confusion, errors, and corruption function to manifest the ones approved by God
Without desolation, confusion, errors, corruption, and darkness, we would not be able to see each individual's condition
When the church is peaceful and secure, everyone is the same; we do not feel that we are any different from others
Very few brothers and sisters stood firm during that storm; only a handful passed through the storm and were approved by God
The storm was like a flood, sweeping away many and leaving only a small number who passed the test and were approved by God
A good conscience concerning which some thrusting these away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander
In both 1 and 2 Timothy Paul emphasizes the conscience because it is very much related to the desolation of the church
Paul's commands to Timothy concerning holding a good conscience are stronger than his words concerning holding the faith
Some deviated from the faith, and some spoke differently from the apostles, because they did not care for the feeling in their conscience
He cannot hold a good conscience without holding the faith, because if he does not hold the faith, his conscience will condemn him
During the desolation of the church, the function of the conscience is crucial, just as lights are crucial in a time of darkness
In all things we need to ask ourselves about our conscience; only the voice of our conscience can be our standard
One of the main factors in the desolation of the church is that the brothers and sisters have problems with their conscience
Because they did not care for the sense in their conscience, some veered off from the faith, and others opposed the apostles
If we follow a certain interpretation, we will be shaken; if we follow a certain argument, we will be confused
We may be wrong in certain matters, but if our conscience has no feeling, our responsibility toward God in these matters is not as great
It does not matter whether it is right or wrong; rather, it is a matter of whether or not our conscience allows us to do it
If we practice this and lead others in this way, then we will learn not to criticize others or to override their conscience
In the midst of the desolation of the church we should hold a good conscience and should not override the conscience of others
If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these he will be a vessel unto honor sanctified useful to the master prepared unto every good work
In the preceding verses Paul speaks of those who preach heresies and damage the work of God, like Hymenaeus and Philetus
We were all earthen vessels, but we have been redeemed and have had a change in nature inwardly to become vessels of silver and gold
In this great tree, that is, in Christianity, there are all kinds of preachers and workers, such as Paul, Timothy, Hymenaeus, and Philetus
We should decide which one to follow, not based on the doctrine they preach but based on the way and result of their work
With respect to ourselves, we need to care for our conscience; with respect to others, we must discern their nature
Rather, it means that once we recognize the wooden and earthen nature of dishonorable vessels, we stay away from them
We may not like the phrase cleanses himself from, because when we cleanse ourselves from people, we must stay away from them
Some people speak of oneness and tell others not to be divisive, but the real oneness is in the golden life and the silver redemption
In the desolation of the church there are different kinds of workers with different kinds of natures and methods
If we do not allow God to work in us, we will be unable to discern the nature of the workers, because we will be the same in nature
Timothy 2:22 says, 'Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
Such persons may be zealous and obtain good results, but when we examine their motive, we see that their hearts are not pure
Some local churches are right in the truth, in their standing, and in their practice, but their motive is not pure
Our standing, truth, doctrine, and practice may be right, but we may not be pleasing to God, because He searches our heart to see our motive
David's followers acknowledged Saul's position and standing as God's anointed, but they also recognized his motive before God
Just as a king cannot sit on the throne with a wrong motive, we cannot use our position in the church as a shield
Saul did not have a pure heart; those without a pure heart may have the right position, but in a short time they will lose that position
If we do not have a pure, single heart for God in our service, we should not expect to find co-workers like David
Putting a person who has a pure heart with a person who has an impure heart is a terrible mixture; it is Babylon the Great
Since their heart has been dealt with, they are able to discern the condition of the heart of those they contact
In the denominations there are many vessels unto dishonor and items of mixture; therefore, we must cleanse ourselves from them
God is not pleased with those who make divisions over doctrinal issues, such as pre-tribulation versus post-tribulation rapture
We should be accommodating in other matters, but the Bible does not require us to accommodate anything of dishonor
If a clump of mud is beneath our feet, it is not simply a matter of lowliness, because mud is dishonorable by nature
If something is dishonorable it is mud instead of gold although we may elevate mud to a high and glorious position it is still dishonorable
If we leave the denominations merely for the sake of doctrine or practices, our action has little value in God's eyes
In God's house there are only vessels unto honor and vessels unto dishonor; we cannot use politics to gain companions
Prayer also means that we are not for ourselves but for the Lord and that we do not follow our own will but the Lord's will
In the same principle, if we are ones who pray to the Lord out of a pure heart, we cannot be joined to someone who does not
In Exodus 32:26, after the Israelites worshipped the golden calf, Moses, as God's representative, said, 'Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me'
Cleansing ourselves from the vessels of dishonor as mentioned in 2 Timothy 2:20-21 is a matter within the church
In the desolation of the church we need to cleanse ourselves from the vessels unto dishonor who are within the church
In order to be vessels unto honor, we need to reject the dishonorable ones; we must cleanse ourselves from them
The desolation mentioned in 1 John involves those who go beyond the teaching of Christ in their preaching and thus become antichrists
John 1:3 says, 'That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us'
As believers, we are joined to the apostles because we all have the same eternal life, and the apostles are joined to God and to His Son
In the desolation of the church the basis of our joining with anyone who calls himself a Christian is the inner fellowship of life
John says that saved Christians cannot have fellowship with those who do not believe in Christ as the Son of God
We may have the thought that if we allow those with whom we cannot fellowship to go their separate ways, it will result in more divisions
Regardless of outward similarities, if there is no fellowship of life between two people, they cannot be joined
There are many saved ones in the Catholic Church; if we go with them to burn incense and kiss the feet of idols, we might gain some of them
If we bring people to our meetings but do not bring them into the fellowship of God's life, whatever we do is accursed
We should never play politics in our dealings with people; rather, we should exhort them to meet where they can receive help
Our hope should not be that people would come to our meetings; rather, our hope should be that we could touch the fellowship of life
In a sense, the increase is not important; what really matters is whether or not we touch the fellowship of life
We cannot have our own choice, and we must learn to live in and to sense if others are in the fellowship of life
If we live in the fellowship of life, we will be able to supply those whom we meet, and they will be able to obtain the supply from us
We need to supply others with life, and we need to receive the supply from them; this is to fellowship in life with one another
John 2:27 speaks of the anointing, and the context indicates that this word is related to being separated from antichrists
John tells us that there is a group of people called antichrists and that we should deal with them by the anointing
We can clearly see in the Epistles that the focus during the desolation of the church is not on doctrinal issues but on nature and motive
The anointing is the operating of the Holy Spirit, which causes us to sense God's presence and feel watered, fresh, bright, and living
In the desolation of the church we should not decide which Christians to meet and work with based on doctrinal considerations
We must also learn to reject the natural man and the flesh by receiving the dealing of the cross in order to live before God
The final seven epistles from the Lord to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 speak very clearly regarding the desolation of the church
Different grounds, doctrines, and ways are worthless, because having the proper ground, doctrine, or way does not make a person an overcomer
The Bible shows that since God's people came into existence, there has been a group of people called the overcomers
From then on the Levites were the overcomers among God's people ; they were responsible for the Ark, which was in their midst
When they entered Canaan, all the Israelites should have fought for the kingdom of God, but they lost their position as warriors
A very small group of people, particularly Gideon and his three hundred mighty men , fought for God in place of all the Israelites
Others maintained and recovered God's testimony in the face of Gentile idols after the captivity to Gentile lands
The entire church should be standing as a testimony, fighting for God; however, it is not, and most members of the church have fallen
The woman signifies all of God's people; she is the aggregate of all those whom God has saved through the ages
The overcomers are the saints who take the place of the defeated believers to fulfill God's intention in the church
The Lord does not want us merely to preach the truth or stand on the proper ground of the church; He wants us to overcome
If we do not overcome, there is a problem with the truth we hold, the way in which we walk, and the ground upon which we stand
According to the order of the seven epistles, the desolation of the church began with losing the first love for the Lord
At a certain point in time, the church lost its first love for the Lord, although it was still zealous in works and labor
Because the church lost its first love, it had a problem in life, and the light of its testimony was no longer clear
A nanny feeds children in the course of her profession, but a mother feeds her children out of love instead of professional duty
The losing of the first love in the epistle to Ephesus is the same as the Israelites' losing the love of their bridal days for the Lord
When the elders administrate the church, they should pour themselves out for the saints because they are constrained by the Lord's love
What makes God's heart the happiest is the building up of His church; God loves and treasures the church more than anything else
When others contact us, they should sense that we have a fresh love toward the Lord and that we have freshly tasted the Lord's love
When such a person gives a message, he will sense not so much that Jesus is the Lord but that He is the lovely One
The first requirement for overcoming is to have a fresh love for the Lord and to maintain the first love for the Lord
Everything we do in our service, work, and meetings should have the flavor of the loving virgins in Song of Songs 1:3
The serving ones should cause others to touch the love of Christ, and they should touch the saints' love for Christ
Because they have a strong conflict between their interest and the Lord's interest, people do not remain faithful
The young brothers and sisters must pay special attention because in many matters they have not learned the lesson to be faithful
If a sister would be as faithful in her service as a mother who cares for her children, she might be the most faithful one among us
In this epistle the Lord does not speak of sin and the world; He touches only the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans
In order to overcome during the desolation of the church, we must not participate in human teachings or organizations
The fruit of the tree of life signifies Christ as man's life, and the hidden manna signifies Christ as man's food
They will have Christ as their life supply, but the flavor of that supply will be the hidden manna, which others do not know
Their words are very persuasive, and if we were like Balaam, they would be like the bait on a fishhook to catch us and carry us away
Anyone who leaves Catholicism and rejects the things of the Roman Catholic Church will be able to receive authority from God
In the face of such desolation, we should leave everything that is apart from the Lord and everything related to Catholicism
According to the fourth epistle, a basic requirement for overcoming is to abandon the worldly things brought in by fallen Catholicism
The principle of idolatry is to desire something other than God; the principle of fornication is to be united with something other than God
The fifth epistle, to the church in Sardis , does not cover the matters for which Pergamos and Thyatira were condemned
A person who touched a corpse or anything dead was defiled and had to be separated for seven days before he could be cleansed
Strictly speaking, sin is not necessarily a defilement, because it is a matter of breaking God's law; death is the real defilement
Sometimes we taste the flavor of Sardis in the bread-breaking meeting; the hymn singing and prayer are not strong, and nothing is complete
Sometimes we taste the flavor of Sardis in the fellowship meetings; the testimonies and even the announcements are weak
The church in Sardis does not have idols the teaching of the Nicolaitans fornication or the deep things of Satan but whatever it has is weak
Sardis has the table meeting, the prayer meeting, the message meeting, and the gospel meeting, but they are all weak
People do not touch weakness and death in him; instead, they touch something of life, something full and without lack
The believers kept the Lord's name and His word in love, and their situation was expressed in the love among the brothers
If we are satisfied because we have the light of the truth and blessing on our work, we are in the condition of Laodicea
The light of the truth and blessing on our work cannot replace the Lord; on the contrary, they may be a frustration to the Lord
The promise to Laodicea says, 'I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me' ; this, too, is a matter of being with the Lord
The first four epistles show that the root of the desolation of the church is the losing of the first love for the Lord
At the beginning of the seven epistles it speaks of the Lord's love, and at the end it speaks of the fellowship in love
We should not take these epistles in a doctrinal way; rather, we should apply them to ourselves, examining and judging ourselves
In order to have a thorough knowledge of the course of the church, we need to know what conveniences and problems it has encountered
In analyzing the course of the church, it is easy to see that it has been assisted and hindered in certain ways
These things are not only part of the history of the church but also are a factor in the situation of the church today
Since the church comes out from humanity and exists among human beings, it cannot avoid having a relationship with humanity
The fact that the church comes out of the human race is typified by Rebecca , and its existence among human beings is typified by Asenath
The church came into existence in humanity, and although it is called out from humanity, it is kept by God among human beings
We must research the story of humanity in order to understand the assistance and hindrances that the church receives from human beings
The Jews built synagogues for the reading of the Old Testament in all the places to which they had been scattered
On the northern shore was Europe, to the south was Africa, and on the eastern shore was the western part of Asia
Students of history know that culture follows water, first by a river, then to the sea, and finally to the ocean
When the church was produced, the oceanic culture was not yet in existence; there was only the culture of the Mediterranean Sea
The New Testament was written in Greek rather than Hebrew, despite the fact that most of it was written by Jewish apostles
By the time the church came into existence, the Roman Empire governed the entire region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea
In a sense, the church came out of Judaism; at least, the first group of people in the church came out of Judaism
From a historical viewpoint, the early members of the church received most of their knowledge of God from Judaism
From a spiritual viewpoint, the revelation they received came from the Old Testament, which was originally in the hands of the Jews
The 'manger' that produced the church was the Jewish temple in Jerusalem; the temple was the place in which the church was produced
Paul did not need to print Bibles; he could simply enter a synagogue and read the Bible, and everyone could understand
After the Sino-Japanese War, the situation changed; we could speak the Mandarin dialect wherever we went-even in Hong Kong
Imagine how difficult it would have been in the age of the apostles if writing and speech were not in one unified language
Before the church was produced, Greek writing and speech had become prevalent in the region around the Mediterranean Sea
Greek was the unifying language of the peoples surrounding the Mediterranean Sea; this was a great convenience to the church
Under the iron-fisted policies of the early Roman government, the apostles were in a large realm that was safe and peaceful
Because the regions around the Mediterranean were under one governing authority, travel was safe, and there were few murders
At the time of the apostles, however, the regions around the Mediterranean Sea all belonged to the Roman Empire
God did a preparatory work in these three areas even before the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost
Human culture became a tool to assist the church once it was established on the earth at the fullness of God's time
Since persecution did not destroy the church, he brought Judaism with its traditions and content into the church
When persecution is unsuccessful, Satan changes his tactics, bringing religious things into the church and bringing the church into religion
In John 16:2 the Lord said, 'An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God'
When religious piety is brought into the church, it is equivalent to bringing in the law of good and evil from Mount Sinai
The principle of Judaism is outward ordinances; the principle of the church is the inward leading of the divine life
We can meet in the desert, not caring about the building or music, because the church is a matter of life and not of anything outward
The church has been chosen out of the world; therefore, the church should not be mixed with the elements of the world
The Roman Catholic Church came into being because elements of Judaism and Gentile religions were brought into the church
The teachings of Confucius cannot be classified as a religion because only worship of God constitutes a religion
Greek philosophy is an amalgamation of world philosophies, which made it a strong influence on the early church
With regard to human life, Greek philosophy speaks of how to behave as a man, and with regard to religion, it speaks of how to worship God
Greek philosophy is superficially similar to the truth of the Bible, which makes it easy for the two to be mixed together
Because they were not yet saved in their thinking, they spontaneously brought concepts from Greek philosophy into the church
In Galatians the apostle makes it clear that the Spirit has replaced the flesh and that Christ has replaced the law
Any teaching or philosophy that departs from Christ reflects 'the elements of the world,' not a revelation from God
We need to see that human things, such as religion, literature, and philosophy, can easily be mixed into the church
In the church there is only Christ; we should take Christ not only as our worship to God but also as our daily living
Before their salvation, without the life of Christ, children must be taught principles of human conduct or else they will become wild
Next, we must use the Bible to show them how to live in Christ and love God and their neighbors according to the life of Christ
We need to consider whether our concepts regarding the church are according to the heavenly pattern or our own design
When we deal with problems in the church, we cannot look only at what appears on the surface; rather, we must determine the source
Do the saints' problems with the responsible brothers issue from the heavenly vision or from 'Greek philosophy'?
May the Lord open our eyes to discern what is of man and what is of God, what is of the old creation and what is of the new creation!
The Roman Empire soon began to persecute the church; we do not know how many Christians were killed by the Romans
In the fourth century, the emperor Constantine changed tactics, ended the persecution, and united the Roman Empire with the church
Many elements of the Roman Empire and the church were intermixed, producing an illegal union of the church and the Roman Empire
Throughout church history the church has constantly faced this kind of problem and has shown a tendency to be mixed with politics
Many European countries have made Christianity their state religion and have not separated the church and the state
Politics and the church are united; this mixture is even more serious than mixture with Judaism or Greek philosophy
The church has fallen from the heavens to the earth and from the hands of the Holy Spirit into the hands of political authorities
The union of the church and politics reached its peak in Catholicism, as seen in the fact that countries send ambassadors to the Vatican
The apostles had driven away Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and the Roman Empire, but the Roman Catholic Church joined herself to them
Whether good or bad, the Lord wants us to discard all things that are not of Christ, because the church is just Christ
Even Judaism, which was treasured by His people, cannot be mixed with the church, much less other things such as politics and philosophy
Whenever we bring human things into the church, its nature is changed, it loses its standing, and it cannot bear its responsibility
The church is a vessel for Christ and the Body of Christ, and everything in it is out of Christ and for Christ
The transmutation of the church refers to the church being altered in its organization and administration, that is, in its government
We cannot say that Clement was the first to bring this system into the church, but his epistle does mention it
When Paul called for them to come, he referred to them as elders, but when he spoke of their function, he referred to them as overseers
He made a great mistake in separating the elders and overseers into two groups, making overseers higher than elders
He became bishop of Carthage, which was a large and highly cultured city in northern Africa on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea
At that time the most cultured city in northern Africa was Alexandria, but Carthage was the second most cultured city in the region
The other bishops were not controlled by the bishop of Rome, but the consensus was that the bishop of Rome held a slightly higher position
Cyprian used the term catholic church to refer to the universal church in the sense of one unified church for the whole world
260 the organization and administration of the church had completely veered away from the pure condition of the apostolic age
During the time of the apostles, the churches had spiritual fellowship with one another without any organizational unity
There were elders in each local church, bishops overseeing several churches in an area, and great bishops supervising larger districts
Cyprians central point was the unification of the church under the control of a unified episcopal system this was his most serious proposal
From its inception on the day of Pentecost, the church was united only through the Holy Spirit, without being organized by human hands
The apostle Peter did not do such a thing, nor did the apostle Paul; none of the apostles used human hands to unify the church
He advocated the unification of the church, arguing that the church could not continue in a scattered, disorderly condition
At the end of the second century some believed that regardless of whether a person believed in the Lord, if he was baptized, he was saved
The social class of those whom we baptize does not matter, but whether they have been regenerated is a real concern
Before the end of the second century the heresy of salvation through baptism was already prevailing in the church
Only a special group of people who attended to matters of service to God could distribute the bread and the cup
The organization, administration, and constituents of the church were transmuted before the end of the third century
It is entirely different from the church on the day of Pentecost and from what was practiced in the early church
Several of those who were responsible for the transmutation of the organization of the church were even persecuted and martyred for the Lord
The Roman Empire persecuted the church through the end of the third century, that is, for at least two hundred and fifty years
Originally the Roman Empire persecuted Christianity, but after Constantine accepted Christianity, the Roman Empire changed its tactics
He introduced elements of Christianity into his government and also extended his political power into Christianity
After his reign, emperors had the power to send bishops away or recall them; the bishops were under the power of the emperor
Those who promote transmutation claim that it protects the truth; none of them believe that they are speaking heresy
They believe that their actions are in accordance with the truth; whether they are actually in accordance with the truth is another matter
Although many Christian groups have veered off the proper course, they defend themselves by saying that they are keeping the truth
These groups have lost the pure, simple nature of the truth and become a complicated and abnormally large mixture
Matthew 13:31-32 indicates that the church should be a small mustard plant, but shows that it has been transmuted into a great tree
Although the church in Jerusalem baptized several thousand believers at one time in Acts 2 and 4 it did not become a great tree as a result
Before the end of the third century, the organization, administration, and basic constituents of the church were transmuted
The churches in all the localities should keep their administration local; they should not be unified organizationally
The administration of the church should not have classes or hierarchy, and the organization of the church should not be unified
The church should not be a catholic church, nor should all the churches on the earth be unified; the churches should be entirely local
The real issue of this history is the effect that the Roman Empire's acceptance of Christianity had on the spiritual condition of the church
Later, Theodosius ordered the destruction of all idol temples in the empire and the abolishment of all pagan religions
Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, and the church was completely united with the Roman government
The union of the church and the Roman Empire completed the transmutation of the administration and organization of the church
It was about two hundred and eighty years from the day of Pentecost to the churchs complete transmutation in administration and organization
They stood apart from the corruption and transmutation; thus, they were not part of the unified, catholic church
In the second century he brought the Jewish priestly system into the church; this system of priests was like a seed sown in the church
The formal beginning of the Roman Catholic Church dates from when the highest bishop was designated as the pope
At that juncture the church had a pope and archbishops; under the archbishops were the bishops, and under the bishops were the priests
These five regions surrounded the Mediterranean Sea and covered all the areas under the jurisdiction of the Roman Empire
Although the four eastern regions did not submit to Rome, Rome still wielded power because it was the capital of the Roman Empire
The popes who succeeded Gregory the Great set in place the Roman organization, system, practices, and authority
In the early stages of the union of the church and the world, worldly customs entered the church in an informal way, not an official way
After the Roman Empire accepted Christianity as its official religion, many Roman customs were brought into the Roman church
Since they are accustomed to celebrating these festivals, when the time comes for the Mid-autumn Moon Festival, they eat moon cakes
The goddess Artemis, whom they worshipped, became the 'holy mother' Mary; Artemis is the Greek name for Diana in the Roman myths
These customs had come into the church prior to the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, but people did not pay much attention to them
Once the office of the pope was introduced, the popes officially recognized these customs and ordered the whole church to follow them
In 1854 Pope Pius IX issued a papal bull proclaiming that Mary was without sin; this is the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception
It is hard to believe that the church has been transmuted to such an extent that it has no life at all and is entirely wicked
As they were dying, they would beg their children to use some of their money to buy masses for them in order to atone for their sins
Spiritually speaking, it is no longer the church, because the heavenly, spiritual nature of Christ is completely gone
Once the transmutation started, those in the church who lived before the Lord began to differ from the majority in their thought
Those who accepted the transmuted organization of the church organized themselves into the catholic church in approximately A
After the catholic church was formed, the sectarianism within the church was clearly manifested, and two lines developed within Christianity
These hidden people lived before the Lord, did not announce themselves to outsiders, and did not live according to the fashion of the day
Later, even the emperors had to kneel before the archbishops and kiss their hands in a gesture of respect and honor
In such a situation the believers who were pure in heart were troubled both by the Roman government and the catholic church
In general, the Roman government at that time was not opposed to Christianity; on the contrary, it welcomed Christianity
Although the Roman government could influence the catholic church, the catholic church could also influence the government
Although the Roman government accepted Christianity, which it had formerly opposed, its acceptance was conditional
Originally, there were five patriarchs, one in Rome in the West and four in the East-in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria
The patriarch of Rome had many clergy under him; these clergymen were called cardinals and had the authority to elect the patriarch
The pure-hearted believers did not want a unification of the whole earth, and they did not accept the hierarchy
The division of the catholic church between the East and the West eventually also developed into two distinct lines
The first was in the West with Rome as its chief city; the churches allied with Rome were called the Latin or the Roman Church
These two major sects of the East and the West have never been rejoined, and they have even attacked each other
At that time, Nestorianism in China, the Ching Religion, was centered in Changan, which is modern-day Xian in the Shaanxi Province
According to Chinese history, the Ching Religion flourished and was received by many of the nobles in the emperor's court
700 was divided into four main groups the Western church the Eastern church the Nestorians and the believers with pure hearts for the Lord
The pure-hearted believers did not have any organization; they simply met in one accord in each locality and served the Lord
The Protestants were not confined to one country; rather, many people all over Europe took action simultaneously to produce Protestantism
The remaining four groups were the Roman Catholic Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Protestant churches, and those with pure hearts
Some nuns let their hair grow, and others shave their heads; their veils and the color of their habits vary as well
The Catholic sects separate themselves rigidly from one another; some emphasize scholarship, and others are interested only in works
In Baguio in the Philippines, we met an American missionary who said he was from the Church of the Nazarene; we had not heard of that group
Some scholars of church history would classify such groups with the pure-hearted believers; some have even been called Puritans
They do not set up churches or join any church; rather, they stay at home reading the Bible, praying, and worshipping God
Once young people are among them, the Catholics use every available method to entice and encourage them to join the Roman Catholic Church
If a student converts to Catholicism, his education will be more convenient in terms of his grades and the treatment he receives
To the Roman Catholic Church, it does not matter whether they are true or false believers as long as they are Catholic in name
Those in their schools who are good students or come from rich families are unable to escape once they are noticed
Their love, care, and sympathy toward these young people are for the purpose of gaining their heart so that they also might become priests
In order to gain young girls, the nuns love and care for the female students to such an extent that they even trim the girls' fingernails
Everyone has emotions, and the Catholics' heart to care for and sympathize with people is much better than ours
Revelation 17 through 19 speaks of MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT God calls Come out of her My people that you do not participate in her sins
Of course, we should not neglect the fact that in the Roman Catholic Church there are a small number of saved, godly people
The only way to escape classification is to not be a Christian; as Christians, we must fall into one of the five major classifications
Many years ago in Nanking, a member of the Uigur tribe from the Sinkiang Province heard the gospel and received the Lord
His aunt met in a church without a name or a pastor; when they came together to meet and sing hymns, it seemed as if no one was leading
We may think that we go to remote areas to preach the gospel because the people in those areas have not heard the name of Jesus
We must seriously ask the Lord where we should be in light of the degraded condition of the church in this age
After the church had been transmuted and became the Roman Catholic Church, in a sense it could not be transmuted or fall any further
Whatever could be transmuted had been transmuted, whatever could fall had fallen, and whatever could be corrupted had been corrupted
With the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, the transmutation and degradation of the church were complete
590, when Gregory the Great established the papal throne, the Roman Catholic Church was fully established in the world
It was more than nine hundred years from that time until Martin Luther was raised up at the beginning of the sixteenth century
During those nine hundred years, the Roman Catholic Church did its best to corrupt, degrade, and defile the church in order to transmute it
The Chinese have a famous proverb that says, 'As soon as a thing reaches its extremity, it reverses its course'
Martin Luther was a central figure in the Reformation, but he was not alone; the Reformation began long before Martin Luther was raised up
Almost every household had some kind of relic; people worshipped the relics and asked the relics for peace and healing
Those who followed Luther to come out of Catholicism were not sufficiently pure and thus were still somewhat confused
Protestantism is still complicated and impure because it was built on a confused and complicated foundation and was not inwardly pure
Although the doctrine of justification by faith was clear, many other aspects of the truth were still in confusion
At one point he helped the landowners suppress a peasant revolt this put him under the powerful hands of the governments that supported him
In Revelation 3 the Lord says to the church in Sardis, 'You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead
After Luther, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, there were many spiritual people in the Roman Catholic Church
Madame Guyon's position was similar to that of the mystics, but the line of the mystics did not begin with her
Protestantism recovered justification by faith, but those in the Roman Catholic Church recovered the knowledge of the inner life
They paid attention to the inner fellowship with God and to living before Him; historians call them the mystics
Although Muller never asked for donations, he would send out a yearly report to let the believers know the situation with his orphans
While she did have some knowledge of life, there were many things from her Catholic background that should have been eliminated
Although Luther reformed the church, it seems that God left the recovery of the knowledge of life within the Roman Catholic Church
Throughout the centuries, God's work has been in reaction to man's move; if we do something improper, God will react to what we have done
We should never think that all the overcomers are in the Protestant churches; there are overcomers in the Roman Catholic Church
The recovery of justification by faith was a great thing; the recovery of the knowledge of life was also a great thing
In the sixteenth century the Reformation was fully formed, and in the seventeenth century the knowledge of the inner life was prominent
A hundred years later, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Moravian Brethren and Count Zinzendorf were raised up
The Moravian Brethren had many special characteristics, such as loving one another and having a condition of one accord
Just prior to or around the same time as the formation of the private churches, the matter of baptism was recovered
At that time the winds of revolution were sweeping through Europe, and they could have swept through England as well
There was no need for such a revolution; a bloodless revolution occurred that saved England from the misfortune of much bloodshed
Although they did not understand the true meaning of holiness, they still exercised to be holy and to have a holy living
At William Law's time, the teachings of the mystics were not able to spread, but after his changes, their teachings became more practical
Many of Andrew Murray's teachings were derived from the writings of William Law and therefore from the mystics
John Wesley could not escape from the influence of the mystics; thus, many aspects of his doctrine of holiness contain a mystical viewpoint
It is not absolutely wrong to state that regeneration is equivalent to sanctification, but there are some problems with such a statement
If sanctification is regeneration, then have those believers who live a defeated life been regenerated or not?
The Wesleys and Whitefield did not preach the gospel to unbelievers; rather, they preached the gospel to Christians
We should not question whether this was from the human element or the divine element; we do not need to analyze it
Some of the Brethren were titled nobility, but they wrote respectful letters to the English monarch renouncing their titles
If we were to compare our situation today with their situation one hundred years ago, we would be far behind them
Probably no other group of Christians in church history has matched the Brethren in the matter of practical living before the Lord
The proper truths taught in Protestantism today are nearly one hundred percent from the truths recovered by the Brethren
Although their knowledge of a few truths concerning overcoming was incomplete, their knowledge of most truths was very proper
The Scofield Reference Bible is popular among Christians today; it is a reference Bible that many preachers cannot do without
Scofield was not an original writer; he passed on material taught by the Brethren, which he collected and edited
Sweet is the confidence Thou giv'st, / Though high above our praise; / Our hearts resort to where Thou liv'st / In heaven's unclouded rays'
We must note here that when Brother Watchman Nee translated this hymn into Chinese, he improved upon the original English
Before the Brethren were raised up, many people thought they were clear in their knowledge of the truth, but they were actually confused
More than ninety-five percent of the work to cut straight of the word of the truth was accomplished by the Brethren
The thought in the Synopsis is deep; Darby's view is broad, and his knowledge of the Bible is something few have attained
A believer, earnestly pursuing the truth, would still have to study this work for ten years in order to understand it
Brother Nee said that if Darby had not become a servant of the Lord, he would have been famous in the world because he had a great soul
In all of church history it is difficult to find a group that can equal the Brethren in the matter of material offering
From the time the Brethren were raised up the recovery work for the next one hundred years was almost entirely in England this was marvelous
Luther did not recover this matter, and although it was partially recovered with the Moravian Brethren, it was not recovered in a clear way
They relied on God, and God looked upon their faith and answered their prayers of faith by specially caring for them
Prior to Hudson Taylor, every mission board used human methods to obtain offerings in support of their foreign mission works
If a person could not pray, overcome sin, or preach the gospel with power, it was because he had not consecrated himself
In principle, when there is a recovery, the Lord's presence is there initially, but as time goes on, the spiritual level gradually falls
Jessie Penn-Lewis rose up to preach the believers' co-crucifixion with Christ, which is the truth of the cross
In all of church history, not many people have known and developed the matter of resurrection as much as the periodical put out by Brother T
The gospel went out to the entire globe, following developments in world politics, military affairs, commerce, and culture
In addition, the missions founded many hospitals; however, this proves that their work was quite complicated and transmuted
Because the Nestorians did not lead people to experience Christ as life, Nestorianism died out when the dynasty changed
Even during the Ming Dynasty, Nestorianism had not completely disappeared; there was still a small number of Nestorians in northern China
Because he knew much about astronomy and the making of calendars, the Chinese imperial court was very courteous to him
He owned a great deal of land in Shanghai's Hsu Chia Hui district, most of which he later donated to the Roman Catholic Church
When the Western missionaries first came to China, they met with difficulty because the Chinese considered all foreigners as enemies
The first Western missionaries to northern China came to Penglai, but it was difficult for them to rent a house
The Chinese people decided that whoever sold land to a foreigner would not be allowed into the ancestral temples or shrines
Later, the foreigners asked the imperial court of the Ching Dynasty for land, according to the provisions of their treaties
The treaties clearly stated that foreigners could preach the gospel in China and that the imperial court had to protect them
The imperial court ordered the local officials to gather the landowners together to discuss and solve this problem
As a result, the Presbyterian Church obtained an old Buddhist temple in Penglai, which they remodeled into a chapel for Western missionaries
Much of his translation work was done in Macao, which is close to Canton; Morrison spent some of his time in Canton and some in Macao
Robert Morrison employed various reasons to remain in Macao, but his real task there was the translation of the Bible into Chinese
The conservative, closed attitude among the Chinese was especially strong in the northern part of China; it is truly beyond description
God is really God; He is over all things and controls all situations, causing all things to work together for His gospel
The Chinese were opposed to foreigners, but according to the treaties, the government was supposed to protect Westerners
The Boxers' slogan was 'Support the Ching Dynasty; destroy the foreigners,' and they had the approval of the Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi
The movement eventually led to the Boxer Rebellion in northern China, in which Western missionaries and Chinese believers were killed
The Boxers called foreigners 'primary devils' and Chinese believers 'secondary devils'; they targeted these two groups for slaughter
The greatest number of martyrs was among the missionaries of the China Inland Mission in Pingyang Fu of Shansi Province
There the church in China encountered its greatest persecution; it was also the greatest purification for the church in China
Many Chinese had joined the Christian religion out of an impure motive; however, many loved the Lord with a pure heart
During this time of persecution, many Chinese believers shed their blood and tears to maintain a good testimony for the Lord
Before that time no one in China had ever clearly risen up to testify for the Lord and there had not been any manifest servants of the Lord
These changes were environmental and although we do not emphasize them they were undoubtedly a factor in the spread of Gods church in China
Others like Hunter Corbett and Calvin Wilson Mateer loved the Lord and suffered for the gospel even to the extent of giving up their lives
These precious missionaries sacrificed their all for the gospel and were purely for the Lord, without a heart for anything else
Because Brother Hudson Taylor sent missionaries into the inland regions of China, the gospel spread to many places, even Szechwan Province
Anyone who heard him preach can testify that he had the Lord's presence and that there was light and power in his speaking
Not long after the Lord raised him up as a young man, he was leading a Bible study for Western missionaries in Shanghai
She was from Ningpo in Chekiang Province, and although she was a traditional woman with bound feet, she received a modern education
On the way to England, when the ship docked at Marseilles in France, she decided to leave the ship and return to China
When she arrived in Shanghai, her family thought that she had gone crazy and could not understand what had happened
The Lord raised up many others with Sister Dora Yu, from both northern and southern China; they loved and pursued the Lord constantly
It is evident that the Holy Spirit was working because He raised up groups who loved and pursued the Lord in all places
He had light when he read the Bible, and he began to meet with a group of believers who were also well-educated
Some of the brothers among them took off their collars and made particular preparations to be martyred for the Lord
With only a few minutes left before the appointed time, a telegram came from the Ching imperial court saying that they were pardoned
Nonetheless, they were not released from prison until after the overthrow of the Ching Dynasty and the establishment of the republic
Of course, the group in Lin Village was off in some ways because they lacked the fellowship of the Body and had not read church history
When she was in her fifties, in about 1920, she went to Foochow and held a gospel meeting in the Hall of Heavenly Peace
Between 1920 and 1925 the Lord worked in marvelous ways in northern and southern China to raise up at least twenty or thirty young people
Because her co-workers were jealous of her, they fabricated charges against her and presented them to the English mission board
After another period of time, she felt that she should return to China, and the Lord opened a way for her to go
Another hymn she wrote is 'He faileth not, for He is God' ; this hymn is familiar to many people in Christianity
He said that every time he went to see Miss Barber, as he sat in the living room waiting for her, he would sense the presence of the Lord
Not long after his salvation, he and his mother met Miss Barber, and they went together to her home and were baptized by immersion
Brother Nee's mother frequently played mah-jongg prior to her salvation, even though she was a member of the Methodist denomination
After he was rebuked he did not feel uncomfortable; on the contrary, the more he was rebuked, the more he felt the benefit
Brother Nee and one of the other brothers were the most gifted among the young people of their generation; they were the best preachers
Brother Nee thought that Miss Barber would have him do the baptizing because he had preached the gospel and led the person to the Lord
When Miss Barber passed away in 1930, she left almost all her spiritual books, writings, letters, and Bibles to Brother Nee
Brother Nee said that if anyone were to write a biography of Miss Barber, he would be the best person to do it
After Sister Dora Yu went to Foochow to preach the gospel, a group of young believers was raised up in Foochow
In 1923 they held a gospel meeting in the home of one of the brothers and invited Sister Ruth Lee from Nanking to be the speaker
Sister Ruth Lee was still a young person; she wrote very well and was the editor of The Spiritual Light paper in Nanking
The gospel vests were gospel banners; some people hung them on their front while others hung them on their back
Woodbury, a missionary from the Christian and Missionary Alliance and the person in charge of the Truth-Keeping Chapel in Shanghai
The main point was that prior to the desolation of Israel, the Ark was in the tabernacle, and the Ark and the tabernacle were one
When Israel was in desolation, the Ark was separated from the tabernacle; the tabernacle was in Gibeon, but the Ark was in another place
Because of the desolation of the church, the testimony of Christ and the outward appearance of the church were separated
Brother Nee was in Nanking when he was excommunicated; therefore, many of the brothers in Foochow felt that this action was not fair to him
When the boat arrived at Mawei, the brothers from Foochow came in a group to meet him; they spoke only of his excommunication
He felt before the Lord that he could not argue about the excommunication, and he saw that it was a big problem
Many brothers were on his side and thought that he had been treated unfairly; he invited everyone to meet that very evening
Brother Nee knew that any discussion of the excommunication would be very explosive; he was clear that they could not discuss it
In 1923 Brother Nee began to publish a magazine entitled The Present Testimony; in Chinese it is called Fu-shing, which means 'revival'
The greatest encouragement came from Brother Nee's meditations on the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3-Meditations on Revelation
Almost all the lovers of the Lord among the Chinese young people had a copy of this publication in their hands
In the beginning there was one brother and a few sisters, and they broke bread in the home of Sister Peace Wang's father
As a result of this conference, churches were raised up in numerous places in the northern part of Kiangsu Province
In Pingyang County in the southern part of Chekiang Province, many brothers began to serve and meet between 1928 and 1930
Between 1927 and 1930 churches were established in Shanghai, in the northern part of Kiangsu, and in the southern part of Chekiang
Although the churches in the north were established after those in the south, the churches in the north were raised up in big cities
Peking and Tientsin were the first and second largest cities in northern China, and Tsinan was the third or fourth largest city
These meetings included people who were not only influential in the church but also very powerful socially and economically
The Christian organizations in China, especially the Western missionaries, were shaken and rose up to oppose us
By the end of 1934 there were churches in each of the four largest cities in the northeast in ManchuriaChangchun Fengtien Harbin and Dairen
On the one hand, there were severe attacks from the outside; some people printed tracts opposing us and even started rumors about us
Brother Nee was in a very difficult situation because the co-workers left, one by one, without telling him the reason
They did not leave because there had been a difference of opinions; it almost seemed as though they left against their will
Only one elderly sister who had not been subject to outside attacks and did not have any opinions stayed with us to deal with the situation
Regrettably, however, her father was imprisoned and became ill in prison, so she needed to leave to care for him
Eventually, the co-workers came back, one by one, because they had the grace of God and learned some lessons of spiritual life
About ten brothers and sisters, myself included, invited him to Hangchow to study Song of Songs; this was still in 1935
Brother Nee recovered the inward freshness and dropped his plan to go to England; instead, he returned to Shanghai
The central messages released that summer in both Chefoo and Shanghai emphasized Christ as the overcoming life
The co-workers wanted to go out to help the churches in all the localities and to strengthen the meetings in every place
Brother Nee specifically pointed out that a servant of the Lord should not stay in one place for a long time but should go out
Brother Nee hoped that a few brothers could bear some responsibility to release the light of the truth in many places
On the one hand, they moved because of government policy, and on the other hand, they feared being massacred by the Japanese
In November Brother Nee called a co-workers' conference in Hankow and spoke again, this time more formally, on the principle of Antioch
The messages given in the conference in Hankow were edited into the book Rethinking the Work in the fall of 1937
In 1938 Brother Nee visited England again and fellowshipped with Brother Sparks; he returned to China in the summer of 1939
Because the area outside the foreign concession was under Japanese authority, we were cut off from fellowship with the rest of the country
In August 1939, after Brother Nee had returned to China, he held a conference, hoping that many people would be able to attend
By that time there were many localities throughout China, and the church in Shanghai was a very large church with several hundred members
As a result of these troubles from within and without, the meetings in Shanghai were formally discontinued in the second half of 1942
After the Japanese occupied China, the country was divided into two regions, the northern region and the southern region
Although churches had been raised up in the inland areas, it was still not easy for localities to fellowship with one another
The daily lives of the brothers and sisters returned to normal, and communications were opened between the north and the south
For six years, from 1942 to 1948, Brother Nee had not been able to formally minister, so that conference was the resumption of his ministry
Brother Nee continued his burden from the Shanghai conference at Kuling in Foochow, where he held the first co-workers' training
The fire of revival, the spirit of the gospel, the zeal for the service, and even the material offerings reached unprecedented levels
The work also ordained at that time that some young brothers and sisters who were learning how to serve would also go to Taiwan
In September 1949, after the training at Kuling ended, Brother Nee returned to Shanghai to help the church there
The churches in mainland China have been completely entrapped in difficulties and persecution; we cannot describe their sufferings in detail
Chang Wuchen Sun Fenglu Liu Hsiaoliang and Chao Chinghuai had been sent by the coworkers in mainland China to Taiwan at the end of 1948
Because the church in Taipei was small and weak, the co-workers asked these four brothers to take the responsibility to lead the church
At the end of 1948 Brothers Chu Hsun-min and Cheng Ta-chiang came to Kaohsiung from Tsingtao and Shanghai respectively
There were two relatively strong churches in Taiwan, one in the northern part and one in the southern part of the province
The church in Hsinchu began through Sister Chu Chih-pu and some other sisters who went to Hsinchu to teach health education
Later, Brother Cheng Pao-chih graduated from teachers' college and went to Hsinchu to teach school; this strengthened the church in Hsinchu
According to our statistics, about four hundred brothers and sisters came to Taiwan from mainland China in the earliest group
These brothers and sisters were seeds sown by the Lord, and they raised up churches in locality after locality
All these churches were raised up through working brothers and sisters who moved to various places for their jobs
On August 1 we formally began the work with the first conference; that conference was the official beginning of the work in Taiwan
Since the work is still in the early stages, all of our trainings have been short-term, but they have helped the churches
Despite the fact that our trainings are short-term, they have been helpful to those bearing responsibility for the service in the localities
The sequence of these spiritual recoveries is very meaningful, just as it was with God's recoveries in Protestantism
The gospel was preached in China for many years, and many lovers of the Lord gave themselves to sow the seeds of the gospel
He said that no good Christian could know with certainty whether he was saved until the judgment at the great white throne
The struggle for this truth continued until Japan invaded China; the Sino-Japanese War began before this truth prevailed
Initially, the battle for this truth was severe; many pastors rose up and accused us of being too bold and too proud
Luther recovered the way of salvation through justification by faith, but he did not recover the assurance of salvation
Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment ranks third in sales worldwide after only the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress
Although people were saved in the past, they did not know that they were saved, and they did not have the joy of salvation
After they were clearly saved and saw in God's Word the truth of baptism by immersion, they went to fellowship about it with Miss M
She brought this recovery concerning baptism to Foochow, and Brother Nee was baptized by immersion there in March 1921
The work of the Holy Spirit caused people to be baptized by immersion it is not an outward ritual but the result of the inward sense of life
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
There are several examples of salvation in the book of Acts, and in each case the ones who were saved asked to be baptized by immersion
Despite the superstition in the Roman Catholic practice, Protestants continue to use the term holy communion, which is an error
Only the Lord and His disciples were present at the Lord's supper; there were only two groups of people, not three
During the Reformation, not only did Roman Catholic terminology remain in use, but the same general way of doing things was also kept
If a certain congregation wants to have the Lord's supper when their minister is out of town, they cannot distribute the bread
Thank God that the gospel, the truth, the Bible, the Lord, the Lord's name, and His salvation came to China through the Western missionaries
When a person receives the gospel and is baptized among a particular group, he becomes a member of that organization
Regrettably, they did not have enough light; thus, a problem arose among them when a brother wanted to be ordained
In 1934 the move to leave the denominations reached a high tide; we saw people everywhere leaving the denominations
Students could preach the gospel after classes, and other saints could preach the gospel whenever they went out
Sister Dora Yu had this experience to some extent, but there was not a solid testimony of living by faith until we were raised up
In Harbin, a congregation was recently raised up; they offered to hire Pastor Ting Li-mei for two hundred silver dollars a month
Many among us were members in a denomination; therefore, we are aware of the general situation in Christianity
In 1922 a few brothers were raised up, and they began to love one another and have fellowship with one another
Before we were raised up by the Lord, being a preacher was considered a profession; it did not matter if a person had been called by God
John's University all have theological seminaries; moreover, there are many schools that teach theology exclusively
Although there were many recoveries in the beginning in 1920, we still had not recovered the matter of spiritual warfare
The messages in that conference were on God's eternal purpose, the kingdom of God, and the way to deal with God's enemy
In early 1934, in the third overcomer conference, Brother Nee shared on Christ as God's centrality and universality and on God's overcomers
The messages in this conference were very high, and they released a great recovery to the brothers and sisters in China
Whenever the church preached the gospel, it involved all the saints moving together; that was a living and strong recovery
The best time period was in 1942 and 1943, when the entire church preached the gospel; everyone opened his home for the gospel
The entire church served in all aspects of the gospel work, including inviting friends, visiting people, and leading people to be saved
The recovery of experiencing the indwelling Christ began after 1942 and continued through the end of the Sino-Japanese War
Many brothers and sisters pursued the inner fellowship with the Lord and learned to experience the indwelling Christ
If it had not been for the war between China and Japan, more than three hundred brothers and sisters would have migrated to the northwest
The first migration to the northwest included more than seventy people; another thirty went to Korea and to the border of Manchuria
The brothers and sisters who went to the northwest in the spring of 1943 raised up meetings in more than forty places in less than one year
May the Lord have mercy on us and make us humble, because after we have recovered a spiritual item, it cannot be kept in oldness
We must live every day in newness, and we must renew our vision daily in order to be able to continue the former things
It would require special grace from the Holy Spirit to remember everything that happened; we really had the Lord's presence
When a person is graced with being part of one of God's special moves on this earth, it is the greatest blessing of his life
It is a great blessing for a person to be able to participate in the flow of God's work, the flow of revival, at least once in his lifetime
If we want to know what attitude we should have toward today's Christianity, we must understand God's attitude toward Christianity
The light and prophecies in the New Testament show God's heart's desire and His attitude toward Christianity in this age
God condemns divisions, mixture with the world, human organization by human will, falling into Babylon, and affording opportunities to Satan
On the other hand, although God condemns these things, He does not intend to eliminate these things in this age or even to forbid them
The number of sects in Christianity will increase over time, and Christianity will become more and more worldly and confused
If we receive mercy from the Lord, we should not participate in the confused, deformed situation in Christianity
Although God does not eliminate or forbid such an improper condition, He does say, 'Come out of her, My people'
When we preach the gospel, give messages, and visit or fellowship with people, we should not mention Christianity
On the positive side we should learn to know life and the Lords way how to live in Gods presence and how to be practically joined to God
We should give our all to go everywhere spreading the gospel of God under the leading and by the power of the Holy Spirit
The Lord does not want us to speak of Christianity; instead, He has commissioned us with the gospel and with life
In this age the Lord has commissioned us to preach the gospel and minister life; He has not asked us to touch the situation in Christianity
Where people meet and how they serve the Lord are entirely between them and the Lord; we cannot intervene in these things
We do not have any intention of competing with or comparing ourselves to others; the thought of competition is fallen
Many severe misunderstandings and persecutions have arisen in the past because we do not refuse to receive anyone
When we meet a sinner we should do our best to preach the gospel to him when we meet a child of God we should do our best to minister life
The practices of some Christians bother our conscience; the way they do things makes it impossible for us to maintain a pure conscience
The believers should love one another, but we do not love one another merely because we serve the Lord together
On the positive side, we should take every opportunity to preach the gospel to unbelievers and to minister life to believers
We should not expect that there will not be any criticism or opposition; the only thing that we should care about is our standing before God
It is wrong for some brothers to seek to draw others into our meetings; other brothers are afraid of criticism, and this also is wrong
The proper attitude is to live as though Christianity does not exist and know only of the Lord, sinners, and Christians
We must learn the lessons of life before the Lord and learn to receive grace to seek opportunities to minister life to others
