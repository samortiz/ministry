<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
THE SOUNDING OF THE TRUMPET<br />
FOR THE ARMY TO GO TO WAR</h2>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s word to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 14:8, he was referring to the matter of speaking in tongues with a definite interpretation. He said that if there is not a definite interpretation of a person&rsquo;s tongue-speaking, this is like sounding the trumpet with an uncertain sound. We may think an item like tongue speaking is too small for our consideration. As we have seen, another item that has been sounded is that there are two lines in the recovery. We may think that these are small things which are not related to the Lord&rsquo;s Person, to His deity, to His divinity, or to His Godhead. Speaking in tongues with or without a definite interpretation and some feeling that there are two lines in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery may be considered by some as minor things which are not related to the major items in the divine revelation. They have nothing to do with the Lord&rsquo;s headship or with the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive work. They are not something modernistic which deny the authority of the Bible or deny God&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Some of the so-called workers, the leading ones, like to think that they can take another line, not following the one line in the ministry. They may consider this and speaking in tongues without a definite interpretation small matters which we do not need to pay attention to. To some extent I myself have had this kind of thought in the past. Although I gave such a serious word that my toleration is over, some brothers may feel, not in a negative way, but in a very positive way concerning me, that they love me and do not think that I need to be that serious about little things such as these. I had the same kind of thought in the past, but through my study I realized that in the New Testament the illustration of a trumpet being sounded to prepare others for battle is only used in 1 Corinthians. This illustration in 1 Corinthians is not used in relation to the person of Christ in His Godhead or to the crucial, eternal redemption of Christ. This illustration is used concerning a minor point, the interpretation of tongues.</p>
<p>Let us read 1 Corinthians 14:6-8 to see the context of this illustration: &ldquo;But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching? Even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, in giving a sound, if they give no distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp? For if indeed the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle? So also you, unless you give by the tongue an intelligible word, how will it be known what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.&rdquo; It is concerning the matter of speaking in tongues, something which we consider to be so small, that the Apostle Paul inserted this verse with the word &ldquo;battle&rdquo; in it. No one among us would consider a battle a small thing. An army that is fighting a battle needs the morale, a fighting unity. In order to maintain this morale even a little dissension concerning the smallest matter has to be killed. If that little dissenting talk is not killed, the morale will be annulled. There will be no more morale, and surely the army will lose the fight, the battle. This warns me concerning the seriousness of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is like the sounding of the trumpet for the army to go on to war (Num. 10:9; Judg. 7:18). The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is a matter of a battle (2 Tim. 2:3 and note 3<sup>1</sup>&mdash;Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FIGHTING ARMY</h2>
<p>We have to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s church today is a fighting army. We are doing something more serious than any battle on this earth. We are fighting against God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. The church is God&rsquo;s army, and this is fully revealed and illustrated in many aspects in Ephesians 6. Ephesians is a book on the Body of Christ, the church. It tells us that the Body of Christ, the church, is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:22-23). It also tells us that this church is the new man created in Christ on the cross (2:15-16). Furthermore, this church is the kingdom of God, the household of the very God (2:19), and the wife of Christ, His counterpart (5:24-25). Paul eventually tells us in Ephesians that the church, the Body of Christ, with such a tremendous status, is a warrior to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy. Whatever Christ is and whatever Christ has done should be used and applied as aspects of the armor of God. We have to wear Christ as our breastplate (6:14) and as our shield (v. 16). We have to have our loins girded with Christ (v. 14), and we have to wear Christ as a pair of shoes for our standing to fight the battle (v. 15). The church is not a mere group of people collected together. The church is a universal and divine army fighting for God in the universe against His enemy.</p>
<p>In modern history there have been two world wars, but we must realize that the church today is undertaking a universal war. The space of our war is much larger than today&rsquo;s space studied by scientists. Most of their study is confined to a single galaxy, but many, many millions of galaxies and beyond form the space in which we are fighting. We are fighting the enemy in the heavenlies, in the universal space. Our battle is great beyond measure. We are not undertaking a small battle merely for the United States or for the world. Our battle is universal. In Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the matter of interpretation of tongues, he considered that it was related to this universal battle that we are undertaking. In his talk concerning the interpretation of tongues, he used an illustration&mdash;the sounding of a trumpet for the battle.</p>
