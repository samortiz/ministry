He questioned Christ in this way in order to provoke Him to deliver him. He knew that Christ was the Coming One, and he had strongly recommended Him to the people (John 1:26-36). After that, John was put into prison (Matt. 4:12), where he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him. However, Christ did nothing for him, although He did much to help others. When John heard of this it might have been that he was about to be stumbled (v. 6). Hence, he sent his disciples with such a question to provoke Christ.</p><p>In…the Lord’s answer to John…[He] mentioned the blind’s receiving of sight, because there had been no such miracle in the Old Testament. By this He gave clear evidence to John that none other than the Messiah could have done such a miracle (Isa. 35:5). In the spiritual sense also, the blind’s receiving of sight comes first. In the Lord’s salvation, first He opens our eyes (Acts 26:18); then we can receive Him and walk to follow Him. The lame signify those who cannot walk in God’s way. After being saved, they can walk by new life (9:5-6; John 5:8-9). The cleansed lepers signify those who have been saved from their rebellion (leprosy) to become the kingdom people. The deaf signify those who cannot hear God. After being saved, they can hear the Lord’s voice (John 10:27). The dead signify those who are dead in sins (Eph. 2:1, 5), unable to contact God. After being regenerated, they can fellowship with God by means of their regenerated spirit. The poor signify all who are without Christ and without God and who have no hope in the world (Eph. 2:12). Upon receiving the gospel, they are made rich in Christ (2 Cor. 8:9; Eph. 3:8). [Matthew 11:6] implies that John the Baptist might have been stumbled…because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way.…In the Lord’s recovery we need to learn this lesson. Whenever the Lord does something positive for us, we are excited. But many times the Lord will not do anything for us. The reason He did nothing to rescue John from prison was that if John had been released from prison his ministry would have been in competition with the Lord’s ministry.

All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come. The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ. Hence, John was greater than all the prophets. Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him. The kingdom people do. John could say only, “Here is Christ,” but the kingdom people can say, “To me, to live is Christ” (Phil. 1:21). Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he. Whether a person is greater or lesser depends on his relationship to Christ. Christ is the deciding factor. The closer one is to Christ, the greater one is.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 377-379, 381-382; Hymns: #415, #395</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
