<p>Christ did not come into being after God created heaven and earth, the angels, and man. Before heaven and earth were, Christ is. Christ existed before heaven and earth were created. Therefore, Christ precedes all creation. He is the Firstborn, the first One, of all creation. As such, He has the first place in all creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Firstborn from the Dead</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:18 says, &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; First, Christ is the Head of the Body; He has the first place in the church. Second, He is the beginning of all things. Third, He is the Firstborn from the dead; He is the first to have resurrected from the dead. Therefore, He can have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:20 says, &ldquo;Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; The word <em>firstfruits</em> shows that Christ was the first to resurrect from the dead. It is one thing for Christ to be the Firstborn of all creation, and it is another for Him to be the Firstborn from the dead. The word <em>creation</em> refers to that which was created. Christ is the first among God&rsquo;s creation. To resurrect from the dead means that the original creation died, was destroyed, and has come out of death, out of destruction. Christ is the first to have been raised out of death. Thus, Christ is the first in the original creation, and He is the first among those who have died and resurrected. Christ is the first in the old creation, and He is the first in the new creation. Christ is the first. There are only these two creations in the universe, and Christ is the first, the Firstborn, in both.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Head of the Church</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:18 says, &ldquo;He [Christ] is the Head of the Body.&rdquo; Since He is the Head, the church as His Body belongs to Him. Therefore, the church is upheld by Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Head over All Things</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Head of the church but also the Head over all things. All creation takes Him as the Head. Ephesians 1:22 says that God &ldquo;gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Lord</h2>
<p>Jesus is Lord of the universe. None of the founders of various religions have dared to call themselves Lord. Only Jesus, in whom Christians believe, is Lord. In the whole universe, only Christ is Lord. First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;To us there is...one Lord, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Verse 3 of chapter 12 also says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 4:5 says, &ldquo;We...preach...Christ Jesus as Lord.&rdquo; These verses declare that Christ is Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being All Things</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:11 says, &ldquo;Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>all</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;all things.&rdquo; Since Christ is all things, He is all, and He is in all things. The sun speaks of Christ as our light, shining on us. Our need for food and drink speaks of Christ supplying us as our food and drink. Every positive thing in the universe speaks of Christ and declares the significance of Christ. Clothing speaks of Christ as our covering, and sleep speaks of Christ as our rest. We can comprehend the significance of Christ even by hearing birds sing and seeing flowers bloom. Every positive thing that we contact should turn us to Christ. Christ is in all things, and He is all things.</p>
<p>When a sister puts on her clothing, she should be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank and praise You because You are my clothing. You cover my shame, and You are my beauty and glory.&rdquo; Every young sister likes to wear beautiful clothes. However, no matter what she wears, she should always say, &ldquo;Lord, You are my beauty and my adornment. You cover me more than these clothes do.&rdquo; This should be the prayer of every Christian.</p>
<p>When a brother eats a rich meal, he should say, &ldquo;Lord, You are my delicacy. May I enjoy You more than I enjoy food.&rdquo; Even when he goes boating, he should say, &ldquo;Lord, You are more secure than this boat; I will let You carry me through every wave.&rdquo; If we would know the Lord, we will discover that He is all things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being in All Things</h2>
<p>Christ is all things, and He is also in all things (v. 11). This means that Christ is the reality of all things and that He is in all things. We can see Him in all things. We should appreciate this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Filling All Things</h2>
<p>Christ is not only in all things, but He also fills all things. Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is &ldquo;the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; It is one thing for Christ to be in all things and another for Him to fill all things. Christ is the One who fills all in all, and the church is His fullness, His expression.</p>
<p>There are some common elements in all things that signify aspects of Christ. The first common element is energy; there is energy in all things. For example, everything has atomic energy. The second common element involves principles; there are principles in all things. The third common element is an operating law; everything operates according to a law. The fourth common element is light; there is light in all things. These elements signify aspects of Christ. Christ is the energy, the principle, the law, and the light in all things. As the reality of all these elements, Christ fills all things.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How God Becomes Man's Enjoyment &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
