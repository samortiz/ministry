WALKING ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</H2><P>[Even a young student has to learn how to experience Christ in the study of his lesson books. He may pray, "Lord, here is the lesson book, and tomorrow will be the final. Lord, prove that You are one spirit with me. Lord, read this book with me." If he does this, I assure you he will experience Christ as his understanding and as his wisdom to take in all the secrets of his lesson book. He will even experience Christ as his good memory. Then the next day when he takes the exam he does not need to be so pressed and so trembling. He just needs to pray, "Lord, I am one with You, and even one spirit with You. Not only in speaking, Lord, even today in the classroom, taking the exam, I am one with You, Lord. Lord, make it so real. Make it so real to the angels. Make it so real to the entire universe that I am one with You." I assure you that he will experience Christ as his wisdom and quite often as his answer. This is the way.]</P><P>[Day by day we should cleave to the mingled spirit and do everything according to this spirit. Whenever we walk according to the flesh we are sinners, no matter whether we regard ourselves as good or bad. But we need not walk according to the flesh, for we have the option of walking according to the spirit. When we do this, we enjoy all the riches of Christ.</P><P>We daily need to practice having our being according to the spirit. We need to apply this in our talking, in our thinking, and in everything we do. For example, suppose a young one is wondering whether he can participate in a certain kind of athletic activity. My advice to him would be that if he can participate in that athletic activity according to the spirit, then he should go ahead and do so. As Christians, we should not decide matters according to right or wrong; rather, we should decide them according to the spirit.</P><P>The Spirit who is mingled with our spirit and according to whom we may have our very being is the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God. Such a Spirit, the realization and application of the Triune God, is now mingled with our spirit.] It [is no longer a matter of simply the divine Spirit nor of just the human spirit, but it is a matter of the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit. Hallelujah for this marvelous mingling!]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>We the believers are one spirit with the Lord. We are in Him and He is in us. The Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is mingled, blended organically with our spirit. In the mingling of divinity with humanity, the original natures are not lost and no third nature is produced. The Spirit witnesses with our spirit testifying that we are the children of God. Every day we should walk according to the mingled spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS </H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is one of the greatest verses in the Bible showing we are one spirit with the Lord?</li><li>Why does the word translated "spirit" in Romans 8:4 present a problem to translators of the Bible?</li><li>What do we mean when we say the life-giving Spirit "mingles" with our spirit?</li><li>Does the mingling produce a third nature?</li><li>Why does the Bible say the Spirit of God witnesses "with our spirit," and not "in our spirit"?
