   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For Receiving Others, Caring for Others,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Speaking the Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next, we need to have someone there to receive people every day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From morning to evening, if anyone comes to ask about something, there should always be someone there to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, you need to tell the local brothers and sisters to serve not only in other matters but also in the business office.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the service office should devote a great deal of time every day to helping the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the viewpoint of some people, this is not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can answer by saying that David said that he would rather be a doorkeeper in God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not be spiritual to such an extent that we could not keep the door of the Holy of Holies well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not consider that the Levites and the priests are different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both are important!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without the Levitical service, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May we all have a heart to serve two or three hours in the church taking care of God's affairs, serving God, and serving His people so that the entire Body will go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Never make the work your own work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need the entire Body to work there and to learn there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we need brothers and sisters to come and be on duty to take care of the affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are many church affairs that require face to face discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, how do we make arrangements for brothers from out of town?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some brothers coming to your place do not know the way, so you have to pick them up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or how should you take care of orphans and widows who are passing through your place?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There may be some people coming to your place to look for certain brothers and sisters, but because they do not know their way, they need deacons to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many things that the church needs to do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Seek out some who have the time to help those in need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Often there are accidents, family problems, and sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church should be notified of these things immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The brothers who are deacons need to find brothers at once who can help these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people find their way to the church meeting place to hear a message, and there are many who knock on the door and want to come in to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You cannot say that the owner is not home, that you do not know how to speak, or that you are a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When people come to the door, either you yourself take care of him or find a brother to come right away to preach to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the future, if God grants us grace and we distribute tracts in an adequate way, many people will come knocking on the door of the meeting hall to hear the gospel as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You cannot say it is not yet time for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to speak to them, or perhaps ask them to take a seat while you find another person to come to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will happen very naturally that people will want to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, I hope you will pay attention to this service office; you need a place and you need deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For Recording Various Works</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>and Keeping a Name List</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Third, you need to always remember the principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The deacon on duty needs to record all of the matters in the business office, with the exception of things that happen incidentally or things that still need to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, except for the slips of paper underneath the glass on the table, the rest of the matters, which are those that have already been carried out and are finished, need to be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The procedure that was used to carry these things out should be written down, and the record kept there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, when the need arises to check the facts, they can be known.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These records are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of the people baptized in a meeting must be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of the people received in a meeting must be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All of the people who have had hands laid on them in a meeting must be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All of the letters of recommendation sent out from a meeting must be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, copies of all the letters of recommendation must be kept on file.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In every meeting place there must be a record of the names of all the brothers and sisters, their address, age, date of salvation, and any other important information, such as the date of their spiritual turns or their present spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everything must be written down completely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All those who have signed their names in the gospel meetings need to be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need to have the new believers go to visit those who came to the gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever number of people came to hear the gospel, that many new believers are needed to go and visit them and care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These new believers need just as many older believers to care for them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These new believers are there, one generation after another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You need to record their affairs in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through this you will know the present situation of those who are being cared for by the ones whom you have sent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The arrangement of the work of the priests also needs to be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We assign them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How many are placed in this work and how many are placed in that work are all recorded at the same time.</S>
