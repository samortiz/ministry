After we are saved, the more we walk according to our own will, the more suffering and the less joy we will have
The more we walk according to the new life and the more we obey God's will, the more peace and joy we will have
We should have the assurance that not only do we want to obey God's will, but God Himself also wants us to obey His will
These three things are: arrangements in the environment, the leading of the Holy Spirit, and the teachings of the Scripture
When the testimonies of these three things are in agreement with one another, we can be assured that we know God's will
No one knows how many hairs he has, and no one can count his own hairs, but God has counted and numbered our hairs
If God takes care of a seemingly worthless creature such as a sparrow, how much more will He take care of His children!
A new believer may not be that experienced in the leading of the Spirit, and he may not know that much of the teaching of the Scripture
God not only guides us through the environment but also speaks to us and guides us from within through His Spirit
My Spirit' refers to the Spirit of God, whereas 'a new spirit' refers to our spirit at the time of our regeneration
If we did not have a new spirit within us, God would not have given us His Spirit, and the Holy Spirit could not have dwelt within us
Man has to receive a new spirit through regeneration before he can be in the position to receive Gods Spirit and before God can dwell in him
Not only is he able to discern God's provision in the environment, but he also now possesses an inward knowledge and inward assurance
We should learn to trust not only in God's sovereignty in the environment but also in the leading of the Holy Spirit within
Whenever we sense any unrest, we should realize that the Holy Spirit within is displeased with what we are doing; He is grieved
If he has enough light, everything will be clear to him spontaneously, and he will not need to waste his energy on such analysis
His will is revealed through the various experiences of men of the past, and all these things were recorded in the Bible
We need the Spirit's enlightenment to understand biblical principles, and we need the Spirit's leading to receive biblical promises
Whether or not it is God's will for you to go to a certain place to preach the gospel depends on the leading of the Spirit
When the Holy Spirit puts a certain phrase or verse within you in a powerful, fresh, and living way, you have a promise from the Spirit
Sometimes, the arrangement of the environment comes first, followed by the leading of the Spirit and the teachings of the Bible
Sometimes, the Spirit's leading and the teachings of the Bible come first, and afterward, the confirmation in the environment
If your inward feeling is different from the testimony of the Bible, it proves that your inward feeling is not reliable
If it is God's will, what you see outwardly will surely line up with what you see inwardly and what you see from the Bible
If your inward sense, the teaching of the Bible, and the environment are all clear, then God's will for you will also be clear
These ones know God's Word more, their flesh has been dealt with somewhat, and they are under the direction of the Spirit
They will consider your condition in the church, and they will sense whether or not they can say amen to what you have seen
An individuals personal feeling understanding of the Scripture and knowledge of the environment may be wrong they may not be that accurate
If the other members of the church think that the 'guidance' you have is not reliable, you should not insist on your opinion
If a brother sins against another brother, the offended one should speak to the offending one while they are alone with each other
Because the church is God's habitation and the beacon of God's light, we need to believe that God's will is revealed in the church
The church can render an accurate and divine confirmation because it has become the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit
The church must be spiritual, and it must allow the Spirit to preside over it before it can be used by the Spirit to be God's mouthpiece
The confirmation of the church does not mean a discussion among all the brothers and sisters in the church together
Only then can there be accurate judgment, and only then will the Spirit give accurate confirmation through them
They think that it is sufficient for them to be clear by themselves and that there is no need to fellowship with the church
Because we are the party involved, we are clouded by our own interests and subjectivity when we seek God's will
The confirmation of the church should not be regarded in the same way as one regards the words of the prophets
In seeking God's will, we must not fall into an abnormal state where the mind is blank and the will is passive
Hebrews 5:14 speaks of those 'who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil'
In Romans 12:2 Paul told us to 'be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is'
In the New Testament there are also visions and dreams, but God does not use them as an essential means of guidance
We need to point out once again that when these three things are in line with one another we can have the confidence that we have Gods will
Many times my heart aches over the fact that many people are looking for methods to know Gods will but they have no desire to obey Gods will
If you have an intense and absolute desire to do Gods will God will make known His will to you even when you know nothing about the methods
Since God has humbled Himself to make His will known to man, we must seek to know His will, and we must worship, treasure, and do His will
