   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Recovered by Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1924 I transferred to Nanking University and came under the influence of modernism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My faith was shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time Watchman Nee was staying in a brother's home in Nanking, recuperating from an illness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I frequently visited him for fellowship, and he helped me escape the influence of modernism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After his health improved, I was able to make arrangements for him to preach the gospel at Nanking University.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result of his preaching, two of my classmates were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Edified by Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1928, when I was about to leave the university, I considered serving the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I did not want to be a preacher on salary, but I did not know how to live by faith, so I went to Watchman Nee for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time he was quite lonely and greatly in need of co-workers who would be of the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I raised this matter, he did not encourage me in a careless manner to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was neither influenced by his need for co-workers nor by the personal relationship between us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He simply told me not to wait until the Jordan waters opened, but to step into the water by faith then the way would open before me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that I lacked this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was waiting for the outward circumstances to change before beginning to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fifty years ago in China it was difficult to find anyone serving the Lord by faith like Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, I laid aside the thought of serving the Lord full-time and taught college for eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the spring of 1934, Watchman Nee held his third overcomer conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the morning he spoke on the centrality and universality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the afternoon he spoke on God's overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through his messages in this conference, the Lord gave me revelation which brought about a great turn in my spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, I stood up in the conference and for the first time consecrated my entire life to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time I was still teaching school.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1935 in Chefoo, Brother Nee experienced anew the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After this, he held a conference in Chuanchow, Fukien, and asked me to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There many were helped to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, with the result that they had power and boldness to witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He also preached on the secret of the overcoming life, which is to let Christ live in our stead, according to Paul's testimony in Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This conference brought in a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Confirmed and Assigned by Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In October 1936, Watchman Nee conducted a co-workers' conference in Kulangsu, Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He cabled me and invited me to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By that time I had become clear concerning the Lord's call and was prepared to resign my teaching job to live by faith and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While I was seeking the Lord for His guidance, I received Brother Nee's invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I immediately realized that it was the Lord's will for me to attend the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I thank the Lord that at this conference I was given the rare opportunity of listening to Watchman Nee's testimony, which I was later able to publish as three articles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end of the conference, Brother Nee and the other co-workers assigned me to begin the work in Canton and later in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1937 Watchman Nee began the Lord's work in the southwest part of China in the city of K'un-ming in Yunnan province.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After establishing the church there, he invited me to come and work in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I picked up the burden and moved my family there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I worked there for three years, until my return to Hong Kong in 1940.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Following World War II, whenever Watchman Nee visited Canton or Hong Kong, I took the opportunity to seek his fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I usually planned to ask him a number of questions, but after having some fellowship with him, it was unnecessary to ask the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In our fellowship I always received an abundant supply of life.</S>
