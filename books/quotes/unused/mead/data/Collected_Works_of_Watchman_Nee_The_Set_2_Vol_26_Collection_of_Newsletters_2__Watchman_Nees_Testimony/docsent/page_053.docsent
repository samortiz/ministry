   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>and all the brothers and sisters:</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We really thank the Lord that in these last days He Himself has worked in P'ing Yang to manifest His truth and cause us to deeply feel the sin of sects, which do not have the real worship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that He raised up a small number of brothers and sisters to leave the denominations in spirit even though we still met with them at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the Lord's Day evening there are six brothers and sisters who break bread in one accord before the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have done this since the spring of 1934, when the Lord led us to completely separate from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the first Lord's Day of the third month of the old calendar, we began to have meetings in the Lord's name in Brother Ma Hsien Yi's home.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Five brothers and five sisters partook of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After we had a meeting like this to worship the Lord, we were attacked and persecuted by the denominations.</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord, He freed Brother Su to worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only Sister Lin cannot be completely free now.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Please pray for her.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the seventh month of the old calendar, Brother Ma met with great difficulty.</S>
