<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee at a conference in Sacramento, California, on November 22-25, 1963. These messages have not been reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR NEED TO KNOW THE INNER LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20; John 10:10b; 1 John 1:2; John 1:4; Rom. 8:2; Heb. 8:10-11; 10:16; Jer. 31:32-34</h1>
<p>In recent months, the Lord has arranged for me to visit many groups of Christians of various backgrounds. After all these visits, I realize that believers today have a need for the real knowledge and experience of the inner life, a life which is Christ Himself. According to my realization, exceedingly few brothers and sisters know what life is, fewer have the real experience of life, and nearly no one knows the right way to experience the inner life. In all of my recent travel across the United States, this has been my unique impression.</p>
<p>I have also discovered that it is rather difficult to help Christians know the proper way to experience the inner life. Although we may talk about the inner life and read articles about it, it is very hard for us to realize the proper way to experience the inner life. By knowledge, I do not mean knowledge in a general way, which is very easy to attain. For example, we may know very clearly that Christ is life and that what we need is not knowledge but life. We may furthermore know that the life we are discussing is not outward but inward, that is, the inner life. Such a superficial knowledge may be common to many of us, but the real meaning of knowing Christ as our inner life is a mystery to many believers. We may know the words, but we very well may not know the proper way to experience Christ as the inner life. It is relatively easy to receive spiritual gifts, but it is very difficult to bring a brother or sister to know the proper way to experience the inner life. As we progress through these chapters, let us pray to receive a definite and much needed vision by which we can both see and experience the central matter of the Christian faith, the Scriptures, and the Christian life&mdash;Christ as our inner life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE&mdash;TO BE LIFE TO MAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire and ultimate intention is to work Himself into us so that we may express Him and represent Him. However, there is only one way that this can be accomplished: God must come into us to be our life. Today there is a great need for Christians to see that God&rsquo;s intention is to make Christ life to us. We are vessels, containers, to contain God, and God is the content that should come into us. If God is going to be our content, He must be life to us. The life that we possess through our natural birth from our parents is not the real life. That life is but a figure, a shadow, that points to the real life, which is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Let us use the illustration of a glove to clarify this point. Although a glove has fingers, its fingers are not real fingers. Real fingers are the fingers of a hand, not the fingers of a glove. Even if a glove has many fingers, those fingers are empty. In the same way, the life with which we were born physically is not the real life; it is but a vessel to contain the real life, which is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit. This is why we need to be born again (John 3:3, 7). We do not need to be born again simply because our human life is sinful. Even if our human life were not sinful, we would still need to be born again. This is because it is not enough that we have the human life; we need the divine life. As human beings, we already have the human life. Now, as those who are fashioned by God to contain Him, we need the divine life, which is God Himself. The ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s salvation is that we take God as our life. Although this is a fact, if we ask most Christians what the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s salvation is or why God saved us, we will realize that not many are clear concerning this. We must all realize that God saved us for a purpose. This purpose is that we would take Him as our life. God&mdash;the almighty, infinite, omnipotent God&mdash;intends and even desires to come into us as life to live in us.</p>
<p>Hence, there are a number of passages in the Scriptures that present this truth. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The phrase <em>Christ who lives in me</em> means simply that God is life to us. We know that Christ is the embodiment of God (John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:9). Consequently, if Christ lives in us, that means that God is life to us. The Lord Himself told us that He came that we may have life and may have life abundantly (John 10:10b). He also told us that as He lives because of the Father, we must live because of Him (6:57). The meaning of these verses is that God has come to be life to us. My burden is that in these days each of us would pray one thing: &ldquo;O Lord, open my eyes that I may see one thing in a definite way&mdash;that You are my life.&rdquo; We all must see that the Triune God is life to us. We must see this as God&rsquo;s goal and as the central matter in the Christian life. The central matter in the Christian life is not the acquisition of holiness, power, or any other spiritual matter. The center of the Christian life is our having God in Christ as the Spirit living within us as our life.</p>
 <p>This is not a matter that we can cover in a quick way. We all stand in great need of God opening our eyes to show us His desire. His desire is that He would live within us and that each of us would take Him as life. The unbelievers have missed the mark of God&rsquo;s intention. They do not know God&rsquo;s intention for either the universe or human beings. Not only have the unbelievers missed the mark, however; even we Christians do not know God&rsquo;s desire, much less have a clear vision concerning it.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s intention, He made man in a certain form yet without content. In God&rsquo;s creation, man is simply a form, a vessel, a container. God intended that the content of this vessel be Himself as the divine life. God&rsquo;s intention is therefore to make Himself one with man. First Corinthians 6:17 states this clearly: &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; When we believed into the Lord and were regenerated, God as life came into our human vessel, and we and the Lord became one spirit. Today our body is a vessel and our human life is our content. If the human life were not in our body, our body would be empty. In the same way that our body is a vessel meant to contain our physical life, so too is our entire being&mdash;body, soul, and spirit&mdash;a vessel that is meant to contain something. God intends that we be filled with Himself as life. Once we are filled with Himself as life, He intends that we live by Him. God&rsquo;s salvation, on the one hand, is to recover us and cleanse us because we as created vessels have been damaged and dirtied by Satan, sin, and the fall. This, however, is not the positive side of God&rsquo;s goal in saving us. God&rsquo;s positive intention in His salvation is that after cleansing us He put Himself into us. Christ&rsquo;s redemption and cleansing prepares us as vessels to receive God as life. God&rsquo;s ultimate and positive intention in His salvation is to come into us as life.</p><h2 class="head1">A LACK OF CLARITY REGARDING<br />
THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Many Christians realize that at the time of their regeneration they received forgiveness, peace, joy, rest, and satisfaction. However, very few believers have the central concept that in addition to these things, we have received God Himself as life. As those who have been regenerated by God, we have God Himself as life living in us. I am afraid that although many of you enjoy peace, joy, rest, and satisfaction, you do not know that God, who is life, is now living within you. Even if you know this fact, I doubt whether you know how to experience God as life or live by Him. This is a great problem among the Lord&rsquo;s children today.</p>
<p>We all know that Christ is the bread of life to us (John 6:48). We also know that the Lord said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57b). But who knows the way to eat Christ? Although we know that Christ is the bread of life, many of us do not know <em>how</em> to eat Christ. God is life to us in Christ as the Spirit. But what is the way for us to live by Christ? What is the proper way for us to experience the inner life which is Christ Himself? I wish to challenge you with these questions. You may say that the proper way to experience Christ as life is by experiencing the Body, but I in turn would ask you by what way we can experience the Body. Again, you may answer that we experience Christ as life by prayer or by contacting the Holy Spirit. Although both prayer and contacting the Holy Spirit are good, these answers are somewhat vague. This matter of experiencing Christ practically as life is a real problem among Christians today. In Christianity today very little is ministered concerning Christ as life to man. Although there is an abundance of lectures, sermons, messages, teachings, doctrines, and talks that are delivered in Christianity, very few of them take Christ as life as their topic. On occasion, Christian teachers will speak something concerning Christ as life, but it is very difficult to find a message that tells us the actual way to experience this inner life. Throughout the past year, in which I have been speaking much about Christ as life, I have come to find out that many saints do not know the way to experience the inner life.</p>
<p>So I would ask the question again: What is the way for us to experience Christ as our inner life? Perhaps you would again attempt to answer this question, saying that in every situation in life, we must recognize that first He is our life and that second we must contact Him in our spirit and draw our strength from Him. Then in every situation, instead of our acting by ourselves, Christ will act through us. This, you may continue, is Christ flowing Himself through us to minister Himself, instead of our trying to minister in ourselves. This would be an excellent answer, but it is still not specific enough.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to be clear on this matter. Although many of us may have insight into this question, it is very difficult to answer with clarity and specificity. I have been perplexed very much about the lack of clarity among the saints concerning the proper way to experience the inner life and have spent considerable time before the Lord considering our situation. Although you may be clear in a limited way, you are not clear to the extent that you can make yourself understood to others concerning the proper way to experience Christ as life. Hence, I would repeat the question once more: What exactly is the proper way for us to experience the inner life?</p>
<p>My burden is not to give you many messages; my burden is simply to help you to be clear about one secret. This secret is worth more than one million dollars, but I would like to give it to you freely as a gift. Secrets are always very simple&mdash;for if something is not simple, it is not a secret. This secret is like a key that gives simple access to something that is otherwise difficult to penetrate. If we have the key, the door is open to us. If, on the other hand, we do not have the key, even if we do many things, the door will remain closed to us. The secret I would like to share with you in these chapters is the key whereby we can enter into the practical experience of Christ as the inner life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE, THE LIGHT OF LIFE,<br />
THE LAW OF LIFE, AND THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Before I give you the key, however, we have to be clear concerning four matters. First John 1:2 says, &ldquo;And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the eternal life. The apostle John tells us that he saw, handled, and declared that life to us so that we may have fellowship. If we want to know the proper way to experience the inner life, we must know the fellowship of life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; In this verse we have the light of life. Then in Romans 8:2 we have two additional matters of life: the law of life and the Spirit of life. Hebrews 8:10-11, 10:16, and Jeremiah 31:32-34 all speak of the Lord imparting a law into us and writing this law upon us. The law spoken of here is the law of life. Hence, we have four matters: the fellowship of life, the light of life, the law of life, and the Spirit of life. These four matters, taken together, are the key of the inner life. If we are to know the proper way to experience the inner life, we must know these four matters. If we do not know them, we do not have the key to experience the inner life. I am concerned that many of you do not know these matters and consequently do not have the key. I am furthermore concerned that even if some of you do have this key, you do not know how to use it.</p>
<p>In the following chapters, we will begin to see something concerning the fellowship of life, the light of life, the law of life, and the Spirit of life. These matters, taken together, are called the law of the Spirit of life. This is a line of ministry that requires much prayer and fellowship on our part. I beg of you to read the above portions of the Word carefully and pray concerning these matters desperately. If you do this, you will have a foundation upon which you will be able to take in the fellowship in the following chapters. I believe that once we become clear concerning these four matters, we will have the key to the inner life and become clear concerning the proper way to experience Christ as life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE<br />
AND THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:4; 14:19-20; 6:57; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4; Gal. 2:20a; John 8:12; 1 John 1:1-7a</h1>
<p>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. (John 1:14)</p>
<p>This verse clearly states that the Lord Jesus, who is life to us, is the light. The life is the light.</p>
<p>Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. (8:12)</p>
<p><em>Light of life</em> is a very special term in the Scriptures. The previous verse says that the life is the light; this verse tells us that the light is the light of life.</p>
<p>First John 1:1 says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life.&rdquo; &ldquo;That which was from the beginning&rdquo; is the Word of life. We know this because this Epistle was written by the writer of the Gospel of John, who wrote in the first verse of that book, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; In the beginning of his first Epistle, it seems as if John was telling the believers, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which I wrote about in my Gospel, is the Word of life.&rdquo; In the second verse, he adds a parenthetical: &ldquo;And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us.&rdquo; The word <em>life</em> here is a proper noun and could be capitalized: &ldquo;And the Life was manifested.&rdquo; Again, from John&rsquo;s Gospel we know that life here is the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. John continues in verse three: &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; To convey the sense that John had in writing these words, we can paraphrase his words: &ldquo;We declare to you the life, but you will have the fellowship. What we declare is the life, but what you will have is the fellowship. If you receive the life, which we declare to you, you will have the fellowship.&rdquo; Hence, the fellowship comes from the life. In verse 4 John says, &ldquo;And these things we write that our joy may be made full.&rdquo; John continues in verses 5 through 7a: &ldquo;And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.&rdquo; In this opening word from 1 John, we see four matters: life, fellowship, joy, and light. According to these seven verses, when we receive the divine life through the apostle John&rsquo;s fellowship, we have the fellowship of life, which causes us to be full of joy and brings us into the light.</p>
<p>The life spoken of in this passage is the Word that was in the beginning and has been manifested to us. Concerning this life, John writes that the apostles first heard it, then saw it with their eyes, then beheld it, then handled it with their hands. After handling it, the apostles declared it to the saints. This shows us how real and available this life is to us. Once we receive this life, we have the fellowship of life. If we have the fellowship, we will be full of joy. Not only so, because this life brings us into God, who is light, we will be in the light. If we are in the fellowship of this life, we are in fellowship with God, and if we are in fellowship with God, we are in the fellowship with the light. In other words, if we have this life, we have fellowship, joy, and light. In this message we will consider the significance of these four matters.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p>I have a very heavy burden that you who love the Lord would realize the proper way to experience Christ as the inner life. It is not easy to have this realization. You may know that Christ is life to you, and you may know that Christ lives within you. Moreover, you may love the Lord and know that you have to pray to Him and contact Him. You may know all these things, but the truth of the matter is that it is rather difficult for me to help you realize the proper way to experience Christ as the inner life in a very real and practical way. It is possible for people to be helped to know that Christ is life to them yet not be helped to know the proper way to experience this life. It is not easy for me to help you in this matter. It is very difficult for physicians to give a clear and understandable explanation of the life in the human body; it is more difficult still to help you have a clear realization concerning Christ as life and help you experience Him in a practical way. For this reason, I have looked to the Lord much, seeking Him that He would grant me a simple way or a clear word whereby I could present this matter to you. What is this simple way? If you are going to experience the inner life, Christ Himself as the divine life, you have to know what the fellowship of this life is. In his Gospel, John stresses mainly that we can have this eternal life but spends little time telling us exactly how we can experience it. It is in his first Epistle that he tells us the right and proper way to experience the eternal life. The way to experience the divine life is simply to know the fellowship of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Flow of Life</h2>
<p>The apostle John declared this life to us so that we may have the fellowship of life. It is rather difficult to arrive at a proper definition of this term, <em>the fellowship of life.</em> One day, after I had spent much time seeking the Lord and referring to books concerning this matter, the Lord pointed something out to me. There are at least two physical things that we can use to illustrate the fellowship of life. The first is an electrical current. Let us say that we are in a room that has been installed with electricity and electric lights. In such a room, we have not only electricity but the current of electricity. This electrical current illustrates the fellowship of life. An electrical current is simply electricity flowing. When the lights are turned on, we have the flow of electricity, the electrical current. However, if the lights are not on, although we still have electricity, we do not have the current, the operation, of electricity. We can also illustrate the fellowship of life with the circulation of blood in our body. The circulation of blood is actually the blood itself circulating. These two illustrations help define the fellowship of life. The fellowship of life is simply the flow of the divine life.</p>
<p>We can bear witness to this in our experience as believers. When we were regenerated, something began to flow within us. This is because as regenerated persons, we have a flow, a current, within us. This flow is the flow of life. The more we love the Lord, spend time with Him, and contact Him, the more this current courses through us. If we check with our experience, we will realize that before we were saved, we did not have this kind of flow within. It was only from the time that we opened ourselves to the Lord and received Him as our Savior and life that this flow began within us. I can still recall the day this flow began in me. One day I went to a gospel meeting. Before the meeting I was not saved, but during the meeting I was regenerated. When I left the meeting, there was something within me that made me want to sing and praise the Lord. I realize now that that &ldquo;something&rdquo; within me was actually the fellowship of the divine life. It was the current, the flowing, of the spiritual &ldquo;electricity.&rdquo; We have this experience repeatedly as Christians. Suppose we spend some time with the Lord and enjoy Him. During that time, do we not feel something flowing within us, burning within us, and even energizing us? This is the fellowship of the divine life. We as believers have the &ldquo;current&rdquo; of the divine life within us.</p>
<p>The proper way to experience Christ as life is to have this flow within us. If we do not have this current flowing within us, something is wrong. Just as a room may be installed with electricity but may not have the electrical current in operation, we may have Christ as the divine life but lose the fellowship of the divine life. If we check with our experience, we will realize that this is truly the case. Having the flow is just like breathing: the air is all around us, but unless we breathe, there is no way to take it in. The way to know whether we are in the fellowship, living by Christ, and experiencing Christ is simply to check whether there is a flow within. Do we have the current within us? If we do not have the flow or if the flow is ebbing, we must cry out to the Lord and open to Him.</p><h2 class="head2">The Fellowship of Life Resulting in Joy</h2>
<p>When you have the flow of life, you will have joy. When I see you with a long face instead of a shining face, I know that you have lost the inward flow. If you have the inward flow, regardless of your situation, you will be full of joy. Indeed, your having joy means that you are in the flow, in the fellowship of the divine life.</p>
<p>Christians, as a rule, must be joyful persons; they must be persons who are full of joy at all times. Sometimes we are so full of joy that we feel we will burst unless we shout &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; Sometimes we are so full of joy that our silence must cease and we must bubble over by speaking. As Christians, we should not be so silent. Because we are so full of the current, flowing, and bubbling of the divine life within us, instead of being quiet, we must shout and speak. You will find that the more you express what is flowing within, the more the fellowship of life will flow within you. This is what it is to be a Christian in the fellowship of the divine life.</p>
<p>We should never quench the fire that is burning within us (1 Thes. 5:19; Rom. 12:11). In other words, we should not smother the flow of the fellowship of life within us. Let us say that we have a fire burning in our fireplace. If we close the flue on the chimney and close all the doors and windows, the fire will go out. If we want the fire to burn, we must give the fire ventilation by opening the chimney&rsquo;s flue and throwing open the doors and windows. When we let the air come in and ventilate the fire, the fire will burn brightly, even to the point of consuming our entire house! If we allow the fellowship of the divine life to flow in us, that is, if we allow the &ldquo;fire&rdquo; to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; in us, this proves that we are living in Christ and taking Christ as our life practically. This is what it is to experience the flow, the fellowship, of life.</p>
<p>As a person who is not especially emotional, I do not like to be too emotional. However, many times when I pray, I find that I must call, &ldquo;O Lord! Hallelujah!&rdquo; If you are careful not to quench the Holy Spirit and if you allow the Spirit to flow, you will most certainly do the same thing. On the one hand, we must be careful not to do this too often in the meetings lest it disturb others. On the other hand, if sometimes the saints do this in the meetings, we should not be disturbed, for this is something in the spirit. Second Corinthians 5:13 says, &ldquo;For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.&rdquo; For others&rsquo; sake we must be sober. However, before God we very often have to be beside ourselves.</p>
<p>If you are a Christian and yet have never been beside yourself, you are not a normal Christian. You have to be a Christian to such an extent that, because there is a current within you, you are beside yourself. I believe that some of the brothers and sisters may have this experience from time to time. However, we must all have these experiences with greater frequency. We have to be in the fellowship, in the current. When we are in the flow of life, we will be full of joy and full of an inward, energizing power. When we are in the flow, it will be very easy for us to experience the Lord&rsquo;s presence and know His mind and will.</p>
<p>This is the simple secret to which I was referring in the previous chapter and the answer to the question that I posed in it. By what way can we practically experience Christ as life? We experience Christ as life by maintaining the inward current of life within us all the time. If anything, anyone, or any place causes us to lose the inward flow, that is a sign that we are wrong. Whenever we have some struggle, quarrel, or strife with the Lord, the inward current stops. Even if we only struggle a little bit or argue with Him briefly, the flow ceases. The flow is not stopped only by disobedience toward the Lord; it is stopped even by the slightest argument or struggle with Him. When the flow abates, we must realize that we are wrong, and we must stop whatever it is that we are doing and cry out to the Lord.</p>
<p>Today if you ask me how I know that I am living by Christ, I will tell you that the answer is simple: I have the flow. I have the current flowing within me. This is very practical and very real. Any time that we do not have the flow within us, we are not living by Christ. In these days, we need to spend time to realize this matter and enter into this kind of practical experience. We have to be in the flow. We have to possess the inward current of the divine life flowing within us all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Shining of the Light of Life</h2>
<p>Not only do we need the fellowship of life; we need to experience the light of life. Whereas the fellowship of life is the current, the flow, of Christ as life within us, the light of life is the shining of the divine life within us. We should not separate the light from the life and think that the life and the light are separate matters. When the life within us shines, it is the light. Here is yet another indication of whether or not we are living by Christ. When we live by Christ, something within us shines, enlightening us within and bringing us into a realm of light. When the light of life is shining within us, there is no darkness in us. We know whether we are living by Christ by checking whether we are in the light or in the darkness.</p>
<p>When we are in the darkness, we can quarrel with the brothers, even to the point of losing our temper, yet not feel that we are wrong. In fact, if we quarrel and become angry yet have no sense of wrongdoing, this proves that we are in darkness and that there is no light within us. In such a situation, not only has the current within us stopped, but the light has gone. Not only is there no flowing; there is no shining. If we are experiencing the shining of the light of life within, when we go to quarrel with a brother, we will realize that we are wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ruling of the Light of Life</h2>
<p>The shining of the light of life not only enlightens; it also governs. Wherever there is light, there is ruling. Light itself is even a ruling power. If tonight the city in which you live were to have no light, confusion would engulf the entire city, and many lawless activities and crimes would take place. This indicates that light is a ruling power. The Lord&rsquo;s light, as often as it shines within us, always rules us and keeps us in order. Our having the flow of life and the shining and ruling of light within is proof that we are living by Christ, that we are in Christ, and that we are taking Christ as our life. It is urgent that we all realize this matter. I pray that the Lord in these days will enable us to realize this and have more experience of living in Christ by experiencing the fellowship of life and the light of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS LIFE<br />
IN A PRACTICAL WAY</h2>
<p>This is the key, the secret, of experiencing Christ as life in a practical way. If we take care of the flowing and shining of life within us, we will have need of nothing else. Of course, we will still need to pray, read the Scriptures, attend the meetings, and fellowship with the saints. But we have to realize that all these proper Christian activities are actually the result of the flowing and the shining. At the same time, all these practices are the instruments, the means, by which we experience more flowing and shining. The basic thing we must realize is that the secret of living by Christ, living in Christ, and taking Christ as our life is to always take care of the inward flowing and the inward shining. If you do not have the inward flowing and shining, you must go to the Lord to deal with Him and be dealt with by Him, for that is a strong indication that something is wrong within. If all the saints among us would take care of this matter day by day, what living, shining, and flowing Christians we would be! Then whenever we come to the meetings, everyone would come with something flowing and shining within their being. The enjoyment of the fellowship of life and the light of life must be our day-by-day and moment-by-moment experience.</p>
<p>I beg of you to practice one thing: take care of the inward flowing and inward shining. As a Christian, you must have the inward flow and shining. If you do not have the inward flow and shining, you are a dead Christian&mdash;one who has lost the fellowship, the inward current, of life. If this is your case, you have to recover the fellowship of life by going to the Lord, dealing with Him, and being dealt with by Him. If you take this way, you will immediately recover the fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: How do we know that we are experiencing the flowing and the shining of life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When you have the inward shining, it is very easy for you to recognize any hint of darkness. From the perspective of the Christian experience, this is very real. As believers, we have something living within us, flowing within us, and energizing and &ldquo;heating&rdquo; us. However, these kinds of experiences have been very much neglected by Christians today. We pay too much attention to other things and as a consequence have neglected this matter. Let us forget about the other things and care for this one thing, that is, for the inward flowing and the shining. When you are going to pray, you have to pray in the flow. When you speak, you must speak in the flow. In the midst of ministering, I have often had the sense that the flow has stopped. Whenever I experience this, even in the midst of ministering, I have to cry to the Lord. I have to be adjusted by Him and be recovered to the inward flow of life.</p>
<p>The divine life, with its flowing and shining, is a living matter. With anything that is living, there is always some amount of registration, feeling, sense, or consciousness. When the Lord within us is flowing and shining, we sense it; we have a deep feeling that there is something flowing and shining within us. We especially have a sensation when we do <em>not</em> have the flow and light of life. When we are surrounded by air and are breathing, we may not have any particular sensation. However, when there is no more air, our sense is awful and very acute.</p>
<p>I stress once again that this is the proper way for us to experience Christ as life. Christ, who is God Himself, is profound, great, and almighty, yet He is so available and real to us. This is a great mercy and grace to us. It is impossible for us to imagine and understand how wonderful this is. The unbelievers do not know of these things. When we talk about the fellowship of life and the light of life with them, they think that we are superstitious. However, we know the reality. We know that the Lord is as real and available as the air. The air is very easy for us to breathe. It needs no preparation for us to assimilate it. If we had to prepare the air in the same way we have to prepare food, we all would have died long ago. There is no need for us to go to the supermarket to purchase air, no need to store it in the refrigerator, and no need to cook it. Wherever we go, the air is ready for us to breathe. The air is vital to our existence, yet it is so obtainable. Our Christ is just like the air that we breathe. This is the simple and practical way for us to experience Christ.</p>
<p>If we all practice this, we will be victorious Christians and spiritual persons, and we will enter into the real church. When we experience Christ in this way, we experience the cross, we are controlled, we are ruled, we are nourished, we are refreshed, and we are strengthened. This is the simple secret whereby we can experience Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Jer. 31:33-34; Heb. 8:10; 10:16; Rom. 8:2</h1>
<p>Jeremiah 31:33 says, &ldquo;But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.&rdquo; The American Standard Version renders the phrase &ldquo;I will put My law within them&rdquo; as &ldquo;I will put my law in their inward parts.&rdquo; This verse speaks of a single law&mdash;&ldquo;My law&rdquo;&mdash;and our inward parts. Hence, God puts His one law into our many inward parts. God also writes this law in our hearts. According to the law that He puts into us, He is our God and we are His people. Verse 34 continues: &ldquo;And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah, for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hebrews 8:10, which is a quotation of Jeremiah, says, &ldquo;For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.&rdquo; Whereas Jeremiah speaks of one law, the author of Hebrews speaks of multiple laws. Hence, the one law becomes many laws. Not only so, whereas Jeremiah states that God will put His laws into our inward parts, the writer of Hebrews says that God will put His laws into our mind. This proves that the mind is one of the inward parts. According to the remainder of the verse, God will be God to us, and we will be a people to Him based on the law that He put into us and wrote on our hearts. The next verse says, &ldquo;And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Hebrews 10 we read a similar passage: &ldquo;This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them&rdquo; (v. 16). Here, as in chapter eight, we read of many laws. However, this time, instead of being put into our inward parts or our mind, they are imparted into our heart. In the next phrase, instead of the Lord inscribing the laws into our heart, they are inscribed upon our mind. Whereas chapter eight says, &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them,&rdquo; chapter ten changes and says, &ldquo;I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them.&rdquo; Verse 17 says, &ldquo;And their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans 8:2 says concerning the law of the Spirit of life, &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO LAWS</h2>
<p>God is a God of covenant, and His relationship with man is based upon the covenants that He has made with him. The law of the old covenant, which is contained in the Old Testament, is the law of Moses, the essence of which is the Ten Commandments. The law of the new covenant, which is contained in the New Testament, is the law of life. God is God to man according to these two testaments, or covenants, with their respective laws. For example, if the children of Israel wanted to maintain a right relationship between God and themselves, they had to make sure that they were right according to the law of Moses. Were the children of Israel to do good things, help people, and even sacrifice their lives for the sake of others, yet be wrong with regard to the law of Moses, they would still be under the condemnation of God. This shows us that the relationship between us and God is based on law.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">A Definition of the Law of the New Covenant</h2>
<p>The law of the new covenant, of the New Testament, is the law of the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). This law of the Spirit of life is actually the law of life. The law of Moses, which was the center of the old covenant, was written on tablets of stone. The law that is at the center of the new covenant is the law of life. This law is written not on stone tablets but upon our hearts. Moreover, the new law, in contrast to the old law, is written not in letters but in the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6). This new law, the law of life, is simply the life of Christ, which is the life of God. The life of God is God Himself. If we have God in Christ, we have the life of God; if we do not have God in Christ, we do not have the life of God (1 John 5:12; 2:23). The life of God and the law of the life of God are thus God Himself in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Definition of the Law of the Old Covenant</h2>
<p>In my youth I was taught to recite the Ten Commandments. However, for some time after I was saved, I did not understand the real definition of the Ten Commandments. By studying the Scriptures, I came to know that the Ten Commandments are the testimony of God (Exo. 31:18). However, if you had asked me at that time for a definition of the testimony of God, I would have been unable to answer. It was after a long time of seeking and prayer that the Lord revealed to me what the Ten Commandments given to Moses as the testimony of God were. As the testimony of God, the law of Moses was a description of what kind of God our God is. The Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses are thus a description of God&rsquo;s character&mdash;even a full description of God Himself. This law reveals to us what kind of God He is.</p>
<p>The laws that people write reveal what kind of persons they are. For example, if robbers make the laws, we will realize by their laws that they are robbers. If people who are just, kind, and full of love create laws, their laws will be full of justice, kindness, and love. On the other hand, if people who are full of hatred and darkness write laws, their laws will make clear that they are people who are full of hatred and darkness. A law is thus the description of the person or persons who made them. Let us suppose that I go to a brother&rsquo;s house and find a list of house regulations that include the following: 1) All the members of this family must rise no later than six o&rsquo;clock in the morning; 2) All the members of this family, from the oldest to the youngest, must keep everything in good order; 3) All the members of this family must learn to be quiet and considerate. Just by reading these house regulations, I know that the brother who made those rules is very strict. If, on the other hand, I read that the members of the family may rest until noon, be untidy, and do whatever they wish, I realize that this brother must be a disorderly, careless, and inconsiderate person. The laws you make reveal what kind of person you are. If you are a good man, you will make good laws; if you are an evil man, you will make evil laws. In the same way, the laws written by God on the two tablets of stone are the description and definition of God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF THE NEW COVENANT&mdash;<br />
GOD HIMSELF WITH HIS ATTRIBUTES</h2>
<p>As we have seen, whereas the old law was the description of God, the new law is God Himself. The old law tells us merely what kind of God He is, but the new law is God Himself coming into us. The old law reveals to us that God is love, that God is holy, that God is righteous, and that God is a God of light, but the new law is the very God of love, holiness, righteousness, and light coming into us to be love, holiness, righteousness, and light to us. The old law was just the description of God. With that law, God remained outside of us. Through regeneration, however, God Himself has entered into us as the law of the new covenant. The new law is thus God Himself within us. God Himself is now within us as our law.</p>
<p>Now we must see the items that comprise this new law. Just as the old law had ten major items (commandments), the new law has a number of items. These items are actually many laws, for this one law, when it is applied to us, becomes many laws. This is clearly seen when we compare Jeremiah 31:33, which speaks of one law, with Hebrews 8:10, which speaks of many laws. These laws are the law of joy, the law of peace, the law of love, the law of humility, the law of patience, the law of diligence, and the law of light among many others. The items of this new law are thus various attributes of God Himself. Because God is holy, righteous, and full of love, the holiness, righteousness, and love of God are items, or laws, of this new law.</p>
<p>Our experience confirms this truth. A brother once went to a store to purchase something. When he paid for the merchandise, the cashier gave him too much change. He was tempted to not say anything to the clerk, take the excess change, and leave. However, at that very moment there was something within him that regulated him in a living way, prompting him to inform the cashier of his mistake and return the extra money. This was the righteousness of God&rsquo;s life as one of the items of the new law regulating this brother.</p>
<p>We can also see the inward regulating function of the law of life in its many items in the matter of shopping. Before we were saved, when we went shopping, we could purchase anything we desired. In fact, the more we purchased, the more we enjoyed shopping. If we experienced any regulation at all, it was the regulation imposed by our financial situation. However, since the time that we were saved, many times we have picked up an item in a department store only to experience something regulating us from within. I believe that many of the sisters have had this kind of experience. Before you were saved, you went to the department store and could buy as you desired. However, now when you go to the department store, you are regulated. The more we love the Lord, the more He will be troublesome to us, and the more strict His inward regulation will be. This inward regulating is the new law, the law of life, which is God Himself in Christ.</p>
<p>I can illustrate this with my own experience as well. In my natural man, I am a very proud person. Before I was saved, I seized every opportunity to boast in myself. Whenever I boasted, I felt glorious and happy. Then the Lord saved me. After being saved, I attempted to continue boasting. However, something was restricting me from within. Notwithstanding the inward restriction, I still managed to boast from time to time. But after I boasted, unlike before, there was no happiness or joy. Things were absolutely different. I myself had not changed. Rather, something was in me that had not been in me before: God Himself in Christ had come into me as the living law to be the regulating element within me.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, we praise people for their humility. Because I liked to be praised by others before I was saved, I tried to be humble, knowing that by being humble, I would receive praise from others. The result of such an attempt at humility, when it was successful, was that I became proud of my humility. In other words, I became proudly humble. After I was saved, when I tried to be proudly humble, I sensed something regulating me within. This inner regulation told me to try neither to be humble nor to be proud but just to be normal. This was the law of life, which is God Himself, regulating me from within. Everyone who has been regenerated by God has within himself this living, regulating element. This regulating element is just God Himself as the law of life. Because we have received this regulating element, God Himself regulates within us all the time. This is the law of life, the law of the new covenant.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE LAW OF LIFE&rsquo;S INNER REGULATION</h2>
<p>The issue of this inner regulation of the law of life is that we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:2, 29). Every day, every hour, in all things, and in every place, this living law, which is God in Christ as the Spirit, is regulating us. The more we are regulated by this law, the more we are transformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<p>We are in the age of the New Testament. In this age, we have one law. This law is the law of life, the law of the Spirit of life. This law is a living law, and it is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit&mdash;the Triune God. The Triune God within us as the living law regulates us from within every moment. On the negative side, His regulating sets us free from all sins (8:2). On the positive side, it transforms us to the image of God. This is the function and the issue of the wonderful law of life.</p>
 <p>As human beings, we are fallen. Our fall was not a matter of merely falling into sin; when we fell, we were mingled with sin. Sin is now within us and mingled with us. This makes us sinners. We are sinful not only in action, behavior, and conduct, but we are also sinful in nature. God&rsquo;s glorious aim and intention, however, is to mingle Himself with us and make us the same as He is. He is holy, so He will make us holy (Lev. 11:44; 1 Pet. 1:16). He is righteous, so He will make us righteous (cf. Dan. 9:14; 2 Cor. 5:21). He is love, so He will make us love (cf. 1 John 4:8; 3:14). He is light, so He will make us light (cf. 1:5; Eph. 5:8). But how can God accomplish this glorious aim within us fallen sinners? First, He cleanses us with the redeeming blood of Christ. Second, as the Spirit, He, the holy Triune God, comes into us to be life to us. As life, God lives in us and regulates us all the time as a law. It is by the operation of Himself as this inner law of life that God transforms us into His image and makes us the same as He is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS LIFE&mdash;<br />
GOING ALONG WITH THE LORD&rsquo;S INNER REGULATION</h2>
<p>The proper way for us to experience Christ as life to us is to take care of the inner regulating of the law of life. Within us there is a continual inner regulating. The more we love Him, the more He will have the chance to operate within us and regulate us inwardly. The more we contact Him, the more the regulating will be active, positive, and forceful. If we would experience Christ as life in a proper way, we must take care of the inner regulating. To take care of the inner regulating means that we go along with Christ, who is life to us. Practically, this means that when we go shopping, we must take care of the inner operation and go along with it. It means that when we talk with the brothers and sisters, we need to take care of the Lord&rsquo;s inner regulating. Even in the smaller matters in our life, we have to take care of the inner regulating. Within us there is the living law, the law of life, which is God Himself. This law, which is living, acting, positive, and powerful, constantly regulates us and makes us the same as He is. Hence, the way to live by Christ is to take care of the inner regulating. Indeed, the evidence that we are truly living by Christ is that we cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s inner regulation. This is the secret and the key to experiencing Christ as life. Because God in Christ as the Spirit is life and the living law that regulates us from within, if we truly live by Christ, we will take care of the inner regulating. If we simply take care of this regulating, we will be refreshed, strengthened, nourished, enlightened, and transformed into His image. Taking care of the inward regulation is the key and the secret to experiencing Christ as the inner life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">INNER REGULATION, INFILLING,<br />
AND OUTPOURING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; 10:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">INNER REGULATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that Jeremiah 31:33 speaks of one law, whereas Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16 speak of many laws. We also saw that Jeremiah says that God will <em>put</em> His law into our inward parts and <em>write</em> His law in our hearts. Therefore, in this chapter we will address two questions: Why does the one law become the many laws, and why does the Lord speak of both putting and writing? These questions and their answers have much to do with our experiences as Christians.</p>
<p>When we were regenerated, the Lord Jesus came into us as the law of life. Because both the Lord and the law of life are life (John 11:25; Col. 3:4), we can say that the Lord Himself is the law of life. When Christ came into us, the law of life was put into us. We now have the law of life within us. Now as regenerated ones, we need the law to be written<em></em> into our inward parts in our daily, moment-by-moment Christian experiences. While it is true that the law of life was put<em></em> into us at the time of our regeneration, if we do not have the proper experiences, we will not have the law of life written<em></em> into us.</p>
<p>When the law was put into us at our regeneration, it was merely one law. However, when we experience this law in our Christian life, it becomes laws. Although there is only one law of life, this one law has many aspects, or items. Every characteristic of God&rsquo;s character and nature is an item of this law. This is true also with the Old Testament law. On the one hand, there was the law as a whole; on the other hand, this one law was itemized into ten commandments, or laws. Hence, the one law of Moses consisted of ten laws. When the law was given, it was given as <em>the law</em>. However, the children of Israel experienced this one law item by item, that is, as <em>laws.</em> It is the same with us. In our experience, the one law of life becomes many laws. When we were regenerated, Christ came into us as life, which life is the law. This was our experience of the law being put into us. When we began to experience this law following our regeneration, we found that this law has many items, including holiness, righteousness, love, faithfulness, and patience. As we have more and more experiences, the law that was put into us at regeneration is gradually written into us item by item. The word <em>write</em> in Jeremiah 31:33 is rendered <em>inscribe</em> in Hebrews<em>.</em> This means that as we experience this divine law, all of its items are worked into our being in an intrinsic way. Through this process of inscribing, something of God&rsquo;s character is mingled with and even woven into our character. This is what it means for the law of life with its many laws to be written into us.</p>
<p>In the prophecy of Jeremiah the law was singular in number. However, when the writer of Hebrews speaks of the law in our experience, he describes it as being plural in number. In Jeremiah the law of life was prophesied, but only in the New Testament age is it experienced. In this experience, the one law becomes many laws. If we go along with this law when it regulates us with regard to the holiness of God, the holiness of God will be woven into our being. Similarly, if we cooperate with this law when it regulates us with respect to God&rsquo;s righteousness, the justice and righteousness of God will be mingled with our character. Then our character, being, and inward parts (our mind, emotion, and will) will be transformed not only in appearance but also in nature.</p>
<p>God in Christ as the Spirit is life to us. This means that the very Triune God is life to us. This Triune God, who is life to us, works within us as a law. The main function of law is to regulate people. When someone is without law, they are without regulation or ruling. On the other hand, when someone is lawful, that is an indication that they are regulated and ruled by law. The law of life works constantly within us, regulating us tenderly, softly, delicately, and subtly, but by no means weakly. If we love the Lord, we will be willing to go along with this regulating and yield to God. The way to yield to God is to go along with the inner regulating. If we do not go along with the inner regulating, this indicates that our yielding to the Lord is not genuine.</p>
<p>By going along with the regulating of the law of life and yielding to God, we will experience Christ as life and grow in life. Not only so, our cooperating with the law of life will cause us to increase in function. The more we cooperate and grow in life, the more our function will be manifested. The manifestation of our function depends upon our growth. We see this in the physical realm. The more a child grows, the more his or her function is manifested. We cannot reasonably expect a child of two years to have a mature human function because he or she has not had enough growth in the physical life. Both our growth and the manifestation of our spiritual function thus depend upon our cooperation with the inner regulating. Be assured that if you do not go along with this inner regulating, although you may attend the meetings, pray frequently, read the Scriptures, and accumulate much Christian knowledge, you will not grow in the spiritual life. You may have many things, but you will not have the growth in life. The growth in life depends absolutely upon our going along with the inner regulation of the Triune God within us as the law of life.</p>
<p>Suppose that I am a man who likes to joke. Even though joking is not sinful or evil, the inner law will surely regulate me from joking. However, because I know that joking is not sinful, it is very easy for me to neglect the inward regulating. If this is my case, I must be assured that my growth in life will be very limited. If I take care of the sense and feeling of the inner regulating whenever I try to joke, I will have to stop joking. As a result of my obedience, I will have much growth in life.</p>
<p>The standard of the inner regulating is much higher than the standard of good and evil. Generally speaking, we Christians do not take care of the inner regulating. Instead, we take care of the standard of good and evil. According to our way of thinking, while we may not speak lies because speaking lies is evil, we are quite comfortable joking because joking is not evil. What is the standard of our daily living? Most of us must admit that the standard we use for our daily living is that of good and evil. We simply take care of the standard of good and evil and pay little attention to the inner regulating of the law of life. As long as a thing is good, regardless of how the law of life is regulating inwardly, we do it. This proves that we live and walk according to the standard of good and evil instead of according to the inner regulating of the law of life; instead of living by the tree of life, we actually live according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>I must testify that in my experience, the reason I do not speak lies is not because speaking lies is evil; I do not speak lies because the inner regulating does not allow me to do so. I do not care about the standard of good and evil. Rather, I pay full attention to the inner regulation. There is a big difference between these two things. If we can differentiate between these two things, we will know the way to experience Christ as life. Conversely, if we do not know the difference between good and evil and the inner regulation of the law of life, we will not know how to experience Christ as life. We may know how to differentiate between good and evil, but we may not know how to experience Christ as our life. The experience of Christ as our life is not in the knowledge of good and evil; it is in the inner regulation of the law of life.</p>
<p>We can illustrate the experience of the inner regulation with a brother getting his hair cut. Let us say that he wants to have his hair cut like a movie star. Even though such a haircut is not evil, if he does not experience the inward regulating within him, that is probably an indication that he is not regenerated. If he is really regenerated by God and has the Triune God within him as his life, there will be some inward regulation that restricts him from getting such a haircut. This inward regulation is not the knowledge of good and evil. Rather, it is one of the many items of the one law of life&mdash;the holiness of God. To get such a worldly haircut is against the holy, sanctified, and separated nature of God. If we go along with the inner regulating, there will be many things that, quite apart from the standard of good and evil, we will not be allowed to do. The inner regulating is the working of the divine life according to God&rsquo;s divine characteristics. As such, it is altogether higher and deeper than the standard of good and evil.</p>
 <p>If you live and walk merely according to the standard of good and evil, at most you will be a good man; you will never be able to be transformed into a God-man. A good man is quite different from a God-man. A God-man is a man who has God living within him and regulating him as life. A God-man takes care of this inward regulating. The more he take cares of it, the more he is transformed by God into a God-man. There are many good men in this world, but we Christians were not called by God to be good men; God predestinated us to be God-men. We become God-men by allowing God to live within us, by allowing Him to regulate us all the time, and by going along with His inner regulating. Only in this way will we be transformed.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:<br />
THE INFILLING AND OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: Would you share with us the difference between the filling of the Holy Spirit and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Spiritually speaking, we received both the infilling of the Holy Spirit (within us) and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (upon us) at the beginning of our spiritual experience, our regeneration. In our Christian life, we may think that these two experiences are separate from each other. However, as we are gradually matured as believers, these two kinds of experiences will merge together.</p>
<p>The infilling, or the inward filling, of the Holy Spirit is for the growth of life. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is for the release of what is within us. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is not merely for power; the outpouring and resulting power are for the release. The more we go along with the inner regulating, the more we are filled, occupied, and possessed by the Holy Spirit within. Yet if we do not have the outpouring, it is very hard for us to release what we have experienced in the Lord&rsquo;s filling of us. Even if we have many experiences of the inner regulating, without experiencing the outpouring of the Spirit, we will be unable to minister to others what we have experienced. When we experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we are released to minister to the saints what we have experienced of the Lord inwardly.</p>
<p>However, in the matter of the outpouring we must exercise some care. The outpouring brings the release, but we must be careful about what we release. What we release depends upon what we have experienced and what is within us. For example, when those who have a bad temper experience the Holy Spirit as their release, they may release their temper. We can see this in the Old Testament. When messengers were sent by King Saul to capture David, they saw a company of prophets prophesying under Samuel. As a result, they themselves began to prophesy. When this was told to Saul, he went to where the prophets were, and the Spirit of God came upon him also. The issue of this outpouring was that he was fully released: he stripped off his clothes and lay down naked all that day and night (1 Sam. 19:20-24), thereby exposing himself. We can only release what we are full of. After some receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, they release many fleshly things. This is because they are full of carnal things. It is thus not sufficient to have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon us; we also need the infilling of the Holy Spirit within us. If we take care of the inner regulating all the time, we will enjoy and experience the infilling. When we are filled with the Spirit, it is very easy for us to receive the outpouring. All we must do is claim the outpouring based upon the inward filling.</p>
<p>When we receive the outpouring of the Spirit, we should not pay much attention to the manifestation, the gifts. Instead, we should pay attention to the infilling. By paying attention to the outward gifts and manifestations, many Christians have been damaged. They have been damaged because, by paying their full attention to the outward manifestation of the gifts but caring little for the inner regulation of the Spirit, they are unable to grow in life. The outpouring is for the growth of life; it is even a help to the inward growth of life. Although the inward growth of life is absolutely a matter of infilling, the infilling needs the help of the outpouring. Hence, there is a need for us to take the infilling and the outpouring in the proper proportion according to God&rsquo;s way. If we do, we will have both the growth of life and the proper manifestation and function of the gifts. If, on the other hand, we pay attention to the outward gifts and manifestations and neglect the inward growth of life, we will suffer damage.</p>
<p>If we pay attention to the inward regulating and have the infilling all the time, we will be able to receive the outpouring whenever we need it. Eventually, we will be persons who always have both the infilling and the outpouring, for in our experience, these two matters will be merged together. We will have the infilling of the Holy Spirit and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, both the growth in life and the manifestation of the gifts. In conclusion, the infilling produces the growth in life, and the outpouring is for the release, the outflow, of what we have received of the divine life through the infilling.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is being filled with the Holy Spirit a process or a crisis?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is both. Spiritual experiences always begin as a crisis but then proceed as a process. Times of crisis cause our experience to deepen. For example, perhaps you were a Christian for years, yet you knew nothing about the inward regulating of the law of life. Then one day the Lord opened your eyes to see this matter. That experience was a crisis that helped you progress. After that crisis, you proceeded in a good way for a certain time. Perhaps two or three years later you came to a point where the Lord showed you something deeper concerning the inward regulation (the inward regulation is a matter of degree). After your first realization, you truly entered into the experience of the inward regulation, but your degree of experience was very low. Although the law of life regulated you in many things, your experience was not especially high or deep. Hence, after a process of several years, you suddenly realized that the inner regulating is much deeper than what you had previously experienced. That realization was another crisis. That crisis was then followed by another normal process. The Christian life is thus a cycle of crisis and process. This is a scriptural principle: first we must enter the gate; then we walk on the way. The walk does not come first; the gate does (Matt. 7:14). This is our experience of crisis and process.</p>
<p><em>Question: Acts 2:4 seems to indicate that the immediate result of the outpouring of the Spirit was a filling: first the saints experienced the outpouring of the Spirit; then they were filled with the Spirit inwardly. Could you please explain this?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must first address how the Greek words for <em>fill</em> are translated into English. The English language has only one word to express the thought of filling, whereas Greek has at least two different words that express it. We may illustrate these two meanings of the word <em>fill</em> with baptism by water. Before a regenerated one is baptized, we must first fill the baptistery with water. Once the baptistery is filled, we immerse the brother into the water. We can also call this immersion a filling, for it &ldquo;fills&rdquo; him with water outwardly. This second filling is a filling that is according to the sense of one of the Greek words. Hence, there are two kinds of fillings. With the baptistery, there is the inward filling, whereas with the brother there is the outward filling. As far as the baptistery is concerned, the water fills it inwardly&mdash;the water is only in it and is not outside of it. As far as the brother is concerned, he is filled with water outwardly&mdash;the water is only outside of him and not inside of him. Both are filled, but in different senses.</p>
<p>Acts 2:2 says, &ldquo;And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.&rdquo; According to this verse, the wind &ldquo;filled the whole house where they were sitting,&rdquo; much like the water fills the baptistery. The Greek word for this inward filling is <em>pleroo.</em> Following this inward filling, verse 4 says that &ldquo;they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The rushing violent wind that filled the house in verse 2 was the Holy Spirit. Now in this verse, the Holy Spirit filled the one hundred twenty disciples. The Greek word rendered <em>filled</em> here is <em>pletho,</em> which indicates outward filling. Suppose the windows of a meeting hall are open and the wind comes in and blows on us. On the one hand, the wind fills the hall inwardly. On the other hand, we are filled with the wind outwardly. As to the hall, the filling is inward. As to us, however, the filling is outward. The filling in Acts 2 is very much like our illustration above concerning the baptistery. The wind, which was the Holy Spirit, filled the house within, much like the water fills the baptistery. At the same time, the one hundred twenty disciples within the house were filled with the Holy Spirit, much like the water fills the one being baptized. The house was filled inwardly; the disciples were filled outwardly.</p>
 <p>By knowing these two Greek words, we can have a clearer understanding of the filling spoken of in the New Testament. When the Holy Spirit speaks concerning infilling in the Scriptures, He uses the Greek word <em>pleroo,</em> and when He speaks concerning outpouring, He uses the word <em>pletho.</em> The word <em>pleroo</em> is used in Acts 13:52 and Ephesians 5:18. The word pletho is used in Luke 1:15, 41, 67 and Acts 2:4; 4:8 and 31; 9:17; and 13:9. A careful study of these verses with a good concordance, such as <em>Young&rsquo;s Analytical Concordance,</em> will render us much help concerning these two words and their different denotations. Again, with regard to the Holy Spirit in our experience, there are two kinds of fillings: one is inward; the other is outward.</p>
<p>Near the city of Nanking, the former capital of China, the businessmen have a custom of going to teashops to drink tea early in the morning. Then in the evening, they go to the bathhouse where they soak in the baths. Hence, they have a proverb: &ldquo;In the morning, the skin embraces the water; in the evening, the water embraces the skin.&rdquo; This is a good illustration of the Spirit&rsquo;s inward and outward filling. We must have both the Holy Spirit filling us within, like the skin embraces the water through drinking, and the Holy Spirit filling us without, like the water embraces the skin through bathing. Through this experience we will eventually be a person full of the Spirit within and without&mdash;full of the Spirit within by drinking and full of the Spirit without by being baptized into Him as the Spirit. We see this in 1 Corinthians 12:13, which says, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This verse shows us that on the one hand, we are baptized into the Holy Spirit and, on the other hand, we have to drink of the Spirit. This verse states clearly what the illustration of the tea and the baths in Nanking portrays. In this one verse we have the two aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit: the inward filling and the outward filling.</p>
<p>Christians today are confused concerning these two aspects of the filling of the Spirit. The so-called Pentecostals promote the outward filling yet neglect the inward filling. Some go so far as to say that if a person has not spoken in tongues, he has not been baptized by the Holy Spirit and is therefore not regenerated. Others maintain that although he may be regenerated, because he has not spoken in tongues, he is not baptized by the Holy Spirit. Many of the Lord&rsquo;s children have been confused by this erroneous teaching. According to the clear word of the Scriptures, we know three things. First, we know that at the time we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we were regenerated by the Holy Spirit (1 Pet. 1:23; John 1:12-13; 3:6b). Second, we know that the Holy Spirit who regenerated us dwells within our spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22). Even if we grieve Him, He will not leave us but will remain within us. Third, since this Holy Spirit who regenerated us now dwells within us, we must yield to Him, go along with Him, and cooperate with Him (cf. Acts 16:6-7). If we do this, He will take the ground to fill us within. The regenerating, indwelling, and infilling of the Holy Spirit are for the inner life. By the Spirit&rsquo;s regeneration, we received the divine life; by the Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling, we are able to be under the ruling of the divine life; and by the Spirit&rsquo;s infilling, we will be matured in life. Although these three items are wonderful, we must go on to experience something else. We must experience the outpouring of the Spirit upon us as power both to release us and to equip us for service.</p>
<p>We can see both the inward and the outward filling with the Lord Jesus. He was born of the Holy Spirit through the virgin Mary (Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:35). This means that throughout His entire life, He was filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly. But when His ministry began at the age of thirty by being baptized in water, the Holy Spirit came upon Him (Matt. 3:16). This does not mean that before this time the Lord Jesus did not have the Holy Spirit. Rather, it means that although He was filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, He still needed to be filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly as the power for Him to preach the gospel (Luke 4:1, 18).</p>
<p>We also see the two aspects of the filling with the apostles. The apostles had already received the Holy Spirit inwardly on the night of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. On that night, the Lord came to them and breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). This breathing was for life. But forty days later, the Lord told them to stay in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit would come upon them (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8). Then after ten days, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon them (2:2, 4). Again, we see the two aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In John 4 and 7 the Lord likens the Holy Spirit to living water for us to drink (4:14; 7:37-39). However, in Luke 24:49 the Lord likens the Holy Spirit to clothing: &ldquo;Behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high.&rdquo; The American Standard Version renders the last phrase of this verse in this way: &ldquo;Until ye be clothed with power from on high.&rdquo; The clothing in this verse is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit as the clothing for us to wear in Luke is quite different from the Spirit as the water for us to drink in John. On the one hand, the Holy Spirit is the water for our drink within. This is for life. On the other hand, the Holy Spirit is clothing for us to put on. This is for power. I hope that you realize these two aspects of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s filling.</p>
<p>With the outpouring there is the manifestation of the gifts. However, the real function of the gifts depends upon the growth in life, which results from the infilling of the Spirit. If we do not have the infilling, we will not have the growth in life and consequently not have the proper function. The function depends upon the growth in life, and the growth in life depends upon the infilling. The manifestation of the gifts depends upon the outpouring. In other words, the outpouring helps us manifest the gifts. Yet I say again, we may have the power and we may have the gifts, but if we do not have the growth in life, we will not have the proper function. Hence, we need both aspects: the inward filling for the growth of life and for the function, and the outward filling for the manifestation of the gifts and for the power. Then as members of the Body we will be completely equipped to live and work.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPECIAL FELLOWSHIP:<br />
THE MEANING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:23-29; 10:16</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we want to see something concerning the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s table. First Corinthians 11:23-29 says,</p>
<p>For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread, and having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me. Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes. So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.</p>
<p>When the Lord said &ldquo;this do&rdquo; two times, He was referring first to taking the bread and eating and second to taking the cup and drinking.</p>
<p>The King James Version inaccurately translates verse 29 as, &ldquo;For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning <em>the Lord&rsquo;s body&rdquo;</em> (emphasis added). According to the Greek text of the better manuscripts, the word <em>Lord&rsquo;s</em> should not appear in this verse. Hence, the verse should read &ldquo;if he does not discern the body,&rdquo; not &ldquo;if he does not discern the Lord&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BREAD: TWO ASPECTS OF MEANING</h2>
<p>In this passage we are told that the bread that we take at the Lord&rsquo;s table is the body of Jesus, which was nailed to the cross and sacrificed for us. However, in the previous chapter, Paul writes, &ldquo;The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). Hence, the meaning of the bread in chapter eleven is different from the meaning of the bread in chapter ten. In chapter eleven the bread signifies Jesus&rsquo; body sacrificed on the cross for us, whereas in the tenth chapter the bread signifies us as the Body of Christ. We all must be clear concerning these two aspects of the meaning of the bread of the Lord&rsquo;s table. The first aspect of the meaning of the bread is the Lord&rsquo;s physical body that was sacrificed, nailed to the cross, and crucified for us. The second aspect of the meaning is that this bread signifies the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body, the church, which includes everyone who has been regenerated by God.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He had a physical body that He sacrificed for us on the cross with a view to imparting Himself to us as life. This is what we may call the Lord Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;first&rdquo; body. However, after He died and resurrected, He regenerated us and brought us together so that we could become His mystical Body. Now the Lord Jesus has &ldquo;another&rdquo; body. This is not His physical body, which was small, limited, and restricted; this is His universally great, mystical Body, the church. We must see that with the Lord Jesus there are two bodies. One body is the physical body that was crucified for us. The other is His mystical Body which was raised up in His resurrection. The Lord sacrificed His physical body in order to bring forth this mystical Body.</p>
<p>When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table and take the bread, we need to have this full and clear realization. The bread on the table first signifies His physical body, which He gave to be crucified on the cross that He might impart Himself into us as life. The second aspect of the spiritual meaning of this bread is that after we have received Him into ourselves as life, we become members of His mystical Body. Once we have received Christ as life, we become the members who are composed together to be His mystical Body. Hence, when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table and take the bread, we must have the clear realization that the bread signifies, on the one hand, that the Lord&rsquo;s physical body was crucified on the cross that we may have Him as our life and, on the other hand, that we all who have received Christ as our life are the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body.</p><h2 class="head1">REMEMBRANCE AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we must keep two words in mind. The first is <em>remembrance,</em> which comes from a repeated phrase in 1 Corinthians 11:24-25: &ldquo;unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; We eat the bread and drink the cup unto the remembrance of the Lord. The second word is <em>fellowship.</em> The cup we drink is the fellowship of the blood of Christ, and the bread we break is the fellowship of the Body of Christ (10:16). Hence, we have the remembrance of the Lord and the fellowship with all the saints. We come to the Lord&rsquo;s table both to remember the Lord and to fellowship with the saints. When we realize that the bread signifies the Lord&rsquo;s physical body, which was nailed to the cross for us, we remember the Lord. But when we realize that the bread also signifies the mysterious Body of Christ, which is composed of all the regenerated saints, we fellowship with all the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BREAD</h2>
<p>When we take the bread, what is our realization? When we receive the Lord&rsquo;s bread, we must have a realization that causes us to pray, &ldquo;O Lord, this bread is Your physical body sacrificed on the cross for me. Now I take this bread in remembrance of You. Lord, this is also Your mystical Body, which is composed of all the saints, including me and all the dear ones here. When I take this bread, I fellowship with them.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s table is thus not merely a matter of remembrance but also a matter of fellowship.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of us only have the realization of the fact that the bread is the physical body of Christ. We realize only that the bread is the Lord Jesus&rsquo; physical body, which was sacrificed on the cross for us. As a result, we only have one aspect of the meaning of the bread and thus only half of the full realization. Because of this incomplete realization, it may seem that there is only a relationship between us and the Lord but not a relationship between us and all the other saints.</p>
<p>It is because we are Christ&rsquo;s mystical Body that none of us can take the Lord&rsquo;s table in our home for and by ourselves. Simply because we love the Lord and enjoy His presence does not mean that we may prepare a loaf and a cup and remember the Lord by ourselves individually. This is because the Lord&rsquo;s table is not simply a matter of remembering the Lord, but it is also a matter of fellowshipping with the saints. You cannot say that the bread is only you; you can only say that this bread is the Body of Christ, which includes you. To take the bread, which is the symbol of the mystical Body of Christ, we need other saints, the representatives of the Body, to be with us. Whenever we take the bread at the Lord&rsquo;s table, we have to realize that by taking the bread, we both remember the Lord and commune with the saints.</p>
<p>Whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table and partake of the bread, we make a twofold declaration to the whole universe. First, we testify that we have Christ as life and live by Him. Second, we declare that because we have Christ as life and live by Him, we have become members of the Body of Christ. The reason we come together to take the Lord&rsquo;s table is to testify that we live by Christ, that Christ is our life, and that consequently we have become members of His Body. When we come together, each of us must come with the testimony that Christ is our life, that we live by Him, and that we are members of His Body. If this is our individual testimony, it will be our corporate testimony as well.</p>
<p>Yet there is a problem. Do we really live by Christ, and do we really realize that we and the other members of the Body are one? If we do not live by Christ day by day and do not realize that we with all other regenerated ones are one Body, we will not have the boldness to testify concerning these things. We will not be free to testify before the enemy, before the principalities, and before the powers in the heavenlies that we live by Christ and are members of His Body. We must live by Christ day by day and moment by moment. Saints, we must have the deep realization that Christ is our life and that we must live by Him day by day. Not only so, we must realize that as we live Christ, we are members of the mystical Body of Christ. We must furthermore realize that far from being independent, individualistic, and separated, we are one with all the saints as the one Body of Christ. If we have such an assurance and such a realization, as often as we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we will have the boldness to testify, &ldquo;Lord, I am here proclaiming, declaring, and testifying that You are my life, that I live by You, and that I am one with my dear brothers and sisters as one Body.&rdquo; This is the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s table is not a small matter. We should never think that the Lord&rsquo;s table is merely a ceremony or a kind of weekly ritual. The Lord&rsquo;s table is more than simply coming together every Lord&rsquo;s Day to sing hymns, give praises and thanks, eat a little piece of bread, and drink a bit of grape juice. That view is altogether too low. The Lord&rsquo;s table is profound, universally great, mysterious, and very meaningful, for in it we have the central thought of God and the eternal purpose of God: that God gave His Son to us as life so that we would live by Christ and become the members of His Body. We come together and set up the table as a testimony, testifying, proclaiming, and declaring to the entire universe, even to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places, that we are a group of people who live by Christ and who are one in Christ.</p>
<p>If we do not live by Christ and do not realize that we are one Body in Christ, when we come to take the table, we will be weak, cowardly, and timid; we will have no boldness to give thanks or offer praise. However, if we live by Christ seven days a week and moment by moment, when we come together we will be able to declare and proclaim to the whole universe that we, as a group of Christians, live by Christ and are really one Body in Christ. We come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to testify concerning who we live by and what we are. We live by Christ, and we are one Body for Christ. We all must have this testimony. This is the significance of the bread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CUP</h2>
<p>What then is the significance of the cup? Man is fallen. We have become sinful. While it is true that on the cross the Lord Jesus gave up His body so that He could share Himself with us, He also shed His blood to cleanse us from our sins. Our sin separated us from God and even kept God away from us. However, the Lord Jesus on the cross shed His blood, cleansed us from our sins, brought us back to God, and brought God back to us. In other words, it is through Christ&rsquo;s shed blood that the relationship between God and us is recovered. This recovery through His blood is a covenant, a testament (cf. Luke 22:20; Heb. 13:20), which God made with us to assure us that He will always be ours, that we will always be His, that there is no separation between us and God, that we can enjoy God, and that God can have us as His people.</p>
<p>Because sin is a separation between God and us, we need the blood, that is, the cup. Let us suppose we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table with the realization that Christ is our life, that we live by Christ, and that we are one with all the saints. When we have such a realization, the enemy, Satan, will come to us and accuse us, saying, &ldquo;How about your sin?&rdquo; When Satan accuses us in this way, we must respond to him, &ldquo;How about the cup?&rdquo; Surely we need to realize that we live by Christ and are one with others in Christ. But we must admit that many times we are weak and that we fail and make mistakes. For example, we may lose our temper with a brother. Then two days later, we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table. As we are sitting there, we may tell the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, I come to You to testify that I live by You and am one with all the saints as one Body.&rdquo; However, Satan will point to us and ask us, &ldquo;How about your temper two days ago? Now you say that you live by Christ and that you are one with all the saints. But how about the day before yesterday? You lost your temper with a brother.&rdquo; If Satan points this out to us, all we must do is point him to the cup: &ldquo;Satan, here is the cup. I am cleansed from my temper by the blood.&rdquo; Of course, we have to confess before the Lord that we have lost our temper with the brother and, if possible, we must make reconciliation with the brother. Then we will be able to testify that although the sin separated us, the blood has recovered us. This is the cup.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s table we have the bread first and the cup second. The bread speaks of something on the positive side, and the cup speaks of something on the negative side. The Lord&rsquo;s table is very significant, for everything of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption is included in it. Whenever we see the bread, it should remind us that the Lord&rsquo;s physical body was sacrificed on the cross and that today we with all the saints have become the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body. Whenever we see the cup, we should realize that the blood cleanses us of all our failures, faults, and mistakes, causes us to be forgiven by God, and looses us from all kinds of condemnation. This table is a table of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ANOINTING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 8:10-11; 1 John 2:27; Acts 16:6-7</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters, we covered our need to experience Christ as the inner life, particularly as regards the fellowship of life, the light of life, and the law of life with its inner regulation. In this final chapter, we go on to consider another aspect of experiencing Christ as the inner life: the anointing.</p>
<p>Hebrews 8:10-11 says,</p>
<p>For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.</p>
<p>It is by the laws that are put into our minds and written into our hearts that God is God to us and we are a people to Him. The relationship between us and God is based on these inward laws, which are the laws of the divine life. In addition to having these laws within us, we as the people of God have no need that anyone teach us or that we teach anyone to know the Lord. Not only the mature ones but also the young ones will know the Lord.</p>
<p>In his New Translation, Darby writes that two different Greek words are translated <em>know</em> in this verse. The first occurrence of <em>know</em> is in the phrase &ldquo;know the Lord.&rdquo; The Greek word here, <em>ginosko,</em> means a general knowledge. The second occurrence of <em>know</em>&mdash;in the phrase &ldquo;all will know Me&rdquo;&mdash;is <em>oida,</em> and it means the inner consciousness of a person about a certain thing. People can teach us to know the Lord only in a general way, that is, outwardly. However, today we have the Triune God&mdash;God the Father in God the Son through God the Spirit&mdash;within us as life. This very life, which is the Triune God Himself, is the living law within us. By this living law, which regulates us constantly within, we know God and have the inner knowledge and consciousness of Him.</p>
<p>First John 2:27 begins, &ldquo;As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you.&rdquo; Again in this passage we read that we do not need anyone to teach us. The reason that we do not need anyone to teach us is given in the next half of the verse: &ldquo;As His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.&rdquo; Today in the New Testament age, there is no need that any person teach us, because we have the anointing, which abides in us.</p>
<p>Hebrews tells us that we have the law. In the previous chapters, we learned that this law is God Himself as life to us, constantly regulating us within. It is by this regulating that we know God. Hence, there is no need of others to teach us to know Him. But whereas Hebrews speaks of the law, 1 John speaks of the anointing. This anointing, which abides in us and which is distinct from the law, teaches us all things. The anointing is the working of the Holy Spirit. In the Bible, the anointing oil is a type of the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit is within us constantly working, moving, and acting. Hence, we have not only the oil but the anoint<em>-ing&mdash;</em> that which is the working, moving, acting, and living of the Spirit within us.</p>
<p>In a previous chapter, we spoke of a house having not only electricity but also the electrical current, which is the flowing of the electricity. In the same way, the Holy Spirit within us is the living Spirit who is living, acting, moving, and working. Consequently, there is a living work going on within us all the time. This is just like the circulation of blood through our bodies. Within our bodies we have not only the blood itself but also the constant circulation of the blood. Just as the electricity is flowing in the house and the blood is circulating in our bodies, the living Spirit who indwells us is living, acting, and working all the time. Regardless of the condition we are in, He as the anointing is always working and moving.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE AND THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>We have two things within us: the law of life and the anointing. We are clearly told in the Bible that we have these two things and that by them we can know God not only in a general and outward way but in a specific and inward way. By the law of life and the anointing we have a deep, inward knowledge and consciousness of God. Although these two matters are distinct, they are not two separate things. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and ultimate goal is to work Himself as life into us so that He would be our content and expression. In other words, God&rsquo;s intention is to mingle Himself with us. This means that we must take God as our life. We are empty vessels made to contain God. If we do not have God in Christ as the Spirit, we have neither life nor content and are thus empty. As the New Testament believers, God has come in Christ as the Spirit to be life to us. Because both the law of life and the anointing are very much related to God Himself in Christ as the Spirit who is in our spirit, we can be assured that both of these matters are within us.</p>
<p>Whereas the law of life is the divine life, which is Christ Himself living within us and regulating us from within, the anointing is the working of the Triune God within us. We have God in Christ as the Spirit within us as life. This means that the Triune God, who is life, is within us. Because the Father is the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in our spirit, we may say that we and the Triune God are now &ldquo;four-in-one.&rdquo; First Corinthians 6:17 says that &ldquo;he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The Triune God as the Spirit dwells in our spirit, and He is working within us all the time. This working is the anointing. On one hand, this Triune God is within us as the law of life regulating us. This regulating is a function of the law of life. On the other hand, the Triune God is constantly working. The anointing is the working of the Triune God within us. Hence, the law of life is the regulating of the Triune God within us, and the anointing is the constant working of the Triune God within us.</p>
<p>An example may make the distinction between the law of life and the anointing clearer. In the Old Testament there were the law and the prophets. Although the law and the prophets are both of the Old Testament, there is a difference between them. The law was a set of rules that God established. As such, the law is certain and unchanging. For instance, one commandment of the law tells us to honor our parents. According to that law, people must honor their parents. The very fact that we are people means that we are required to honor our parents. There was no need for the Jews to seek God and ask Him whether or not they should honor their parents. The fact that a law was something set up by God obviated any need to seek God as to whether they should observe it. In the same way, if someone wanted to steal something, they did not have to ask the Lord whether it was right or not for him to steal. The law was a set of unchanging rules, and it functioned to regulate the children of Israel.</p>
<p>While the law was constant and unchanging, the prophets gave living guidance that was appropriate to whatever situation was at hand, such as whether one should do a certain thing or go to a certain place. The prophets told the people what the law could not tell them. Whereas the law was a determined set of rules that regulated people&rsquo;s lives so that they would be the same as God, the function of the prophets was to give people living guidance.</p>
<p>The Old Testament law corresponds to the law of life, and the Old Testament prophets correspond to the anointing. As regenerated ones living in the New Testament age, we live not according to the law of letters, but according to the law of life. Strictly speaking, we do not need the prophets either, for we have the anointing within us. Instead of the law of letters, we have the law of life within us, and instead of the prophets and their guidance, we have the living anointing within us. Just as those in the Old Testament age had the law and the prophets, we in the New Testament age have the law of life and the anointing.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE LAW OF LIFE<br />
AND THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>Allow me to illustrate the difference between the law of life and the anointing in our daily experience as believers. First, we can use the example of getting a haircut. In order for me to know whether or not I should go to a barbershop to get my hair cut today, I need guidance. I also need guidance to know whether I should go in the morning or in the afternoon. Guidance is also needed for me to know which barbershop I should go to. Even in small matters such as getting our hair cut, we need guidance. To receive this guidance, I must fellowship with the Lord and remain in contact with Him. It would even be good if I would ask Him, &ldquo;Lord, may I go to the barbershop today? If so, to which one?&rdquo; The guidance here is the anointing. Now, let us assume that I become clear through the inward anointing that I should get a haircut at a certain place. Once I am there, my experience may change somewhat. For example, there is no need for me to ask the Lord whether or not I should have my hair cut according to the style of a movie star. It is unnecessary to pray in this way because I already have the inner regulating that prohibits me from doing that. Even if I have the intention of having my hair cut like a movie star, something within will regulate me and say, &ldquo;Do not do it.&rdquo; This is a matter that we must take very seriously.</p>
<p>We can also experience both the anointing and the function of the law of life in the matter of shopping. Whether or not a sister should go to the department store to shop and when she should go are a matter of guidance, that is, the anointing. But once she is in the department store, there is not much need for guidance because the law of life regulates her from within. If she picks up an article of clothing that is inappropriate because it does not befit a saint, something within will regulate her, the holiness of God being an item of the regulating divine life. Hopefully we have all had this kind of experience. I have experienced this same function of the law of life many times while reading the newspaper: the Lord within regulates me, telling me not to read certain things. Again, this is my experience not of the guidance of the anointing but of the regulating function of the inward law of the divine life. God Himself as life regulates our living, walk, and life so that we may be transformed into His image. Regardless of what we do, say, or think, and regardless of where we go, something within regulates us. If we want to buy an item of clothing that does not match the holiness of God, we experience the regulating.</p>
<p>By means of these examples, I hope we can see that the guidance is from the anointing and that the regulating of our lives is according to the inner law of life. The Triune God is these two distinct matters within us: the law of life, which has the function of regulating us, and the anointing, which functions to guide us.</p>
<p>The Triune God as life within regulates us all the time as the living law. This law, when it is applied to us, becomes many laws. In Jeremiah 31:33 we have the one law that is written into us but in Hebrews 8:10 we have the many laws. This indicates that the one law becomes many laws. This is because, although God as the divine life is one, when He is applied to us, there are many items, including holiness, righteousness, light, love, and patience. That the many laws with their regulating are being written into us means that the characteristics of God&rsquo;s nature are being woven into our being. Jeremiah tells us that this one law was put into our inward parts. Then in Hebrews we are told that these many laws are imparted into our mind. The mind in Hebrews is one of the inward parts spoken of in Jeremiah. This means that these laws, that is, these many items of the one divine law, as they are written into us, transform our mind, emotion, and will into Christ&rsquo;s image. The more we go along with the inner regulating, the more we will be saturated by the Triune God as the Holy Spirit, and the more we will be transformed. When we believed into the Lord, we were regenerated in our spirit, and when the Lord comes back, our body will be transfigured. However, between these two steps our soul must undergo the process of transformation (Rom. 12:2). The Spirit, who is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, lives in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), but He does not want to remain there. He is waiting for the chance to saturate our mind, our emotion, and our will, that is, to transform the inward parts of our being. This is the transformation that is spoken of in Romans 12:2: &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; We are transformed in our soul by the indwelling Triune God as life regulating us in our daily walk and daily living. In both big and small things, this living law regulates us all the time. Every time we take care of this regulating and go along with it, we give the Triune God the opportunity to transform us, that is, transform our soul. This is the regulating of the law of life within us.</p>
<p>While we very much need to experience the law of life, we also need to experience God&rsquo;s guidance. This is in the anointing. In whatever we do, whether in working or in determining whether we should go to a certain place, we need guidance. Acts 16:6-7 says that when the apostle Paul tried to stay in Asia to speak the word, he was forbidden to do so by the Holy Spirit. It also says that when Paul tried to go into Bithynia, the Spirit of Jesus did not allow him. Both the forbidding and disallowing were the guidance that came from the anointing. Just as with Paul, it is by this anointing, this working of the Holy Spirit within us, that we know the will of God. By this anointing, we have God&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
<p>Hence, as believers, we must pay attention to two things: the first is the inner regulating of the law of the divine life, which is God Himself in Christ as life, and the second is the inner anointing, which is the working of the Holy Spirit within us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL WAY TO KNOW THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>How then can we know the inner anointing in a practical way? Knowing the anointing is very simple&mdash;so simple, in fact, that it may seem hard to believe. If we physically anoint someone with oil, that person no doubt feels or senses the anointing. It is the same with the anointing spiritually. The Holy Spirit is anointing us all the time. As a result, we constantly have a certain deep sense or consciousness within. If we take care of this sense, we will sense it. Do not complicate this matter by asking, &ldquo;Is this the mind or is this the conscience? Is this feeling from my American (or Chinese) background?&rdquo; If you ask these questions, an otherwise simple situation will become very complicated. Be simple. Realize that you have Christ as the Spirit within you as the embodiment of the Triune God. Because He as the living One lives within you, He is always working, always anointing. This means that you constantly have a certain amount of inner feeling. If you simply go along with that inner feeling, that will be sufficient. The way to know the anointing is therefore very simple.</p>
<p>Then you may ask, &ldquo;Could I be wrong in understanding this inner sense?&rdquo; It is here that we encounter the problem. If your heart is wrong, everything else will be wrong as well. If your motive is impure, then everything else will be foggy and cloudy. You must love the Lord. If you love the Lord, the inner sense will be very keen. Indeed, the more you love Him, the keener your inner sense will be. For this reason we must purify our heart. Matthew 5:8 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; Only when we have a pure heart will we see God. We must have a loving and pure heart with a pure motive. A pure heart that has a pure motive is a heart that seeks God and nothing else. If you seek something other than God, you will be foggy in your inner sense. If you would like to have a pure heart, simply tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, by Your mercy I seek nothing but You. Lord, be merciful to me. Help me to be pure in my heart and pure in my motive so that I would seek just You and nothing else.&rdquo; If you pray in this way, everything will be clear as crystal. Everything will be transparent. Then it will be easy to sense the Lord&rsquo;s guidance and His will step by step and moment by moment. If this is your experience, there will be no need for others to teach you. You will know.</p>
<p>In 1944 I took a long rest to recover from a serious illness. During those two and a half years, I was kept away from my work and even my family. I consequently became quite lonely and desirous of brothers with whom I could fellowship. One brother who cared for me during this time and would often come to me and fellowship would frequently speak to me at length about his situation. Time after time, he came to me with a certain question. His question was whether or not he should do a certain thing. When he asked me, I was led by the Lord not to teach him. I could only answer him with two words: &ldquo;You know.&rdquo; When I told him this, he immediately responded, &ldquo;Yes. I know.&rdquo; Although the brother came back to me many times and asked me whether or not he should do that thing, all I could say in response was, &ldquo;You know.&rdquo; It is the same in our situation. Is it not true that you already know what you should do? You do. If you have a heart that loves the Lord with a pure motive, you know within yourself the Lord&rsquo;s mind and will. I would say one hundred times that you really know. The way to know the anointing is very simple.</p>
<p>As with all matters of the divine life, the experience of the anointing is quite profound, and no one can fully understand it. Yet in another way, the anointing is very simple. Christ lives within you. On the one hand, He is life to you; as life He is the law that regulates your daily walk and your daily living. On the other hand, He is the One who is always working within you and anointing you. Regardless of what you are going to do or where you are going to go, this inner anointing gives you a sense, a deep consciousness, a deep registration. The only thing you need to do is love the Lord. Should you not have a heart loving the Lord, simply go to the Lord and pray, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me. Grant me a heart to love You.&rdquo; Pray and consecrate yourself to Him not for the work but for Him to move and work within you. In whatever you are planning on doing, you have to be purified in your motive, seeking nothing besides the Lord Himself and His glory. This is all you need in order to experience the anointing.</p>
<p>If you practice this all the time, you will never stop growing. Not only so, you will never cease being filled with the Holy Spirit and being saturated with Him. In this way, your whole being will be mingled thoroughly with the Triune God. Then you will have the image of God. You will be transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18). You will automatically and spontaneously be built together with others. You will walk, you will work, you will live, and you will do things according to the guidance of the Lord and according to His will. This is the proper way to experience the inner life.</p>
<p>I urge you not to take these matters as mere teachings. Teachings do not help. This fellowship is at most a set of directions that point you toward the right way to practice and experience Christ as the inner life. If you go on taking this way, I am fully assured that you will enter into an evermore glorious experience. Regardless of what kind of situation the Lord may bring you into, it will be glorious. Thank the Lord for this simple way.</p></body></html>
