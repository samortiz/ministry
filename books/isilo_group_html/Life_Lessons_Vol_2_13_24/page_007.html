This meeting is divided into two parts, the first part for remembering the Lord and the latter part for worshipping the Father.<h2 class=head1>I. REMEMBERING THE LORD- WITH THE LORD AS THE CENTER</h2><p>1)&#8220;And having taken a loaf...He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me. And similarly the cup after they had dined&#8221; (Luke 22:19-20).<p>The bread breaking meeting is not for anything other than remembering the Lord with the remembrance of the Lord as its center for the Lord&#8217;s enjoyment. Everything in this meeting, whether hymn singing, prayer, Bible reading, or words of inspiration, should take the Lord as the center, speaking either concerning His person and work, His love and virtues, His living or suffering on the earth, or His honor or glory in heaven, that others may consider or realize these things in order to remember the Lord Himself. In such a meeting, we should think of the Lord in our hearts and behold the Lord in our spirit that we would be inspired concerning the Lord. Then we will express our inspiration through songs, prayers, reading of the Bible, or words, that the feeling of the entire meeting would be directed to the Lord and that all would remember the Lord.<h2 class=head2>A. Eating the Lord&#8217;s Supper</h2><p>The three verses quoted in the beginning of this lesson show us that the breaking of bread is to eat the Lord&#8217;s supper and to attend the Lord&#8217;s table. Eating the Lord&#8217;s supper is for us to remember the Lord; attending the Lord&#8217;s table is for us to have fellowship together in the Lord&#8217;s accomplishments for us. In the aspect of eating the Lord&#8217;s supper, we should mainly do the following three things:<h2 class=head3>1. Remember the Lord</h2><p>1)&#8220;The Lord Jesus...took bread...broke it and said, This is My body, which is for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:23-24).<p>According to what the Lord has established, whenever we break bread, there is not only a loaf of bread prepared for us to break and eat, but next to the bread there is also a cup prepared for us to receive and drink. By eating the Lord&#8217;s bread and drinking the Lord&#8217;s cup, we eat the Lord&#8217;s supper in remembrance of the Lord. The bread and the cup are both symbols. According to what the Lord said, the bread signifies His body that He gave for us and the cup signifies the blood that He shed for us. His body was given for us on the cross and His blood was shed for us also on the cross. He gave Himself for us in order to impart life into us that we may partake of Him. He shed His blood for us in order to redeem us that our sins may be forgiven.<p>When we see or receive the bread that we break, we should consider how the Lord became flesh for us, how He died for us in the flesh, and how His body was broken for us and given to us that we may have His life. In the Bible, bread refers to life. The Lord said that He is the bread of life which gives life to the world (John 6:33-35). Whenever bread is mentioned, we must think of life. The Lord&#8217;s body being broken to be given as bread to us means that He gave His body for us that we may have His life. We partake of His life when we receive His broken body. All of this is signified by our breaking of bread and by the bread which we break.<p><B>2)&#8220;Similarly also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:25).</B><p>In the bread breaking meeting, we should consider the Lord and what He did for us not only when we see or receive the bread which we break but also when we see or receive the cup which we drink. This cup signifies the new covenant, which the Lord enacted for us by shedding His blood. Whenever we see or receive this cup which we drink, we should consider how the Lord partook of flesh and blood for us (Heb. 2:14), how He not only gave His body for us that we may have His life, but how He also shed His blood for us that we may have the topmost blessing, that is, to be delivered from sin and obtain God and all that is of Him. By this symbol, we should consider how the Lord bore our sins, was made sin for us, and was judged and cursed for us, shedding His blood, which constitutes our cup of blessing, our eternal blessed portion. We should also consider how we are redeemed, forgiven, sanctified, justified, reconciled, and accepted by God through the Lord&#8217;s blood; how it cleanses us from our sins and washes our conscience that we may come to God with boldness; how it speaks better things before God; and how it resists the attacks from the evil spirits for us that we may overcome the Devil who accuses us.<p>In the Bible, the bread denotes life and the cup signifies &#8220;portion,&#8221; such as &#8220;Jehovah is the portion of...my cup&#8221; (Psa. 16:5). Originally we were sinful and evil, and the portion we deserved from God should have been the cup of God&#8217;s wrath, that is, to go into the lake of fire to suffer the torment of eternal perdition (Rev. 14:10; 21:8). However, God made the Lord Jesus drink the cup of wrath for us on the cross (John 18:11). He received God&#8217;s righteous judgment for us and fully tasted the torment of perdition in the lake of fire; He shed His blood to fully redeem us from our sins and enacted the new covenant for us, giving us instead the cup of salvation (Psa. 116:13) and becoming our cup (of blessing) (Psa. 23:5). In this blessed cup of salvation, God Himself and all that He has has become our portion, our eternal blessed portion, and the portion of our cup.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life Lessons, Vol. 2 (#13-24) &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
