   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Resumed Meetings Kweiyang</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We want to report to you the good news that the meetings in Kweiyang have been resumed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We believe you also will rejoice over this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>About four or five years ago, there were meetings in the Lord's name at 33 Chaoyao Street, Nan Men Wai, Kweiyang.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, they were stopped for some unknown reason.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank the Lord for His grace in bringing a few brothers and sisters here from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to not grieve the Holy Spirit and to serve Him according to His will, we started home meetings on November 21 of this year, and we began to break bread to remember the Lord on December 4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We now have gospel meetings or message meetings on the Lord's Day mornings at 10:00 and the Lord's table meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a prayer meeting every Tuesday evening and a fellowship meeting every Saturday evening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are four brothers and three sisters who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We meet in a sister's home at 222 Zhong-Hua South Road, Kweiyang.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are few in number, but by the Lord's grace, we firmly believe He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We passed through several months of prayer and waiting until we clearly realized that we should rise up to meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that we are very young and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we also know the importance of the commission given to us by the Lord and the holiness of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We feel that we are very unworthy!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we are forced to cry out to you and ask you to pray desperately for our meetings and for the Lord's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through your prayers we will receive mercy so that we may not bring shame to His name!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your weak members in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Time Spent at Ninghai Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The work here in Ninghai consisted of a twenty-day conference for the responsible ones and those who are more advanced in life from all the surrounding localities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We gave them thirty-four of the lessons for the edification of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We showed them the way of pursuing the Lord individually, the way before the church today, the way of the gospel, and the way of the entire Body coordinating in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord opened the eyes of many to see the way, and all were willing to rise up to serve and to leave everything to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the exception of a few who had come from the denominations, all consecrated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With regard to the brothers' and sisters' money, we asked them to give it to their respective local churches to be dispensed by each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We asked the leading brothers and the local churches they represented to make a statement and a pledge to the co-workers in Hangchow, pledging to place themselves and the churches under the authority of the Head and in the hands of the co-workers, and to follow the footsteps of the flock in the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have already sent a report of the situation and their consecrations to Brother Hsu Da-wei in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Presently, all the churches are in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have asked the elders to wait for the co-workers from Hangchow to come make arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will temporarily serve God according to their individual leadings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord has placed the fire of revival in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the localities have risen up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I personally am pursuing the outflow of love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I seem to have a vision of a person who is humble and meek, full of love, kindness, and sweetness, who is seeking for the lost ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is such a beautiful picture!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But I am too far from this picture and can only look to Him for mercy, hoping that one day I will be matured.</S>
