[1]  CHAPTER ONE CONCERNING THE USE OF REFERENCE BOOKS AND OTHER WRITINGS 1
[2]  I believe we have seen in a sufficient way that we need to help the saints to get into the full knowledge of the truth.
[3]  As we have pointed out, the so-called theology in today's Christianity is not just of one school.
[4]  THE NEED OF A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE BIBLICAL TRUTHS
[5]  I also strongly indicated that we should charge our young people to learn the biblical languages of Hebrew and Greek.
[6]  Since I came to the United States, in my speaking I have rarely referred you to some other writings.
[7]  This does not mean that we are exclusive or narrow.
[8]  While I was staying there, Brother Nee did a number of things to put me on the test to find out where I was, what I was, and how much I could do.
[9]  These verses tell us that when the Spirit comes, "He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged."
[10]  We have seen that we should not bring in any distractions or frustrations to the Lord's ministry.
[11]  I do not mean that we do not have the liberty to read the old books.
[12]  You are free to go to any books, but if you go to the books I would say you run a risk, and you will probably waste your time.
[13]  If you ask for my advice, I would say that you had better not go to others' books until you have finished the course of the Life-study Messages and the Recovery Version with the footnotes to get a strong footing and a proper foundation which gives you the best discernment.
[14]  George M ller did not agree with this either.
[15]  He said that you should not consider a brother such as Hudson Taylor a "companion of sin."
[16]  In this chapter we will consider the region of the work and the relationships between the regions and the churches.
[17]  Based upon this, we can see that the Judaizers, the Judaizing believers, tried to overcome the Gentile believers at Paul's time.
[18]  If the Lord's move, the Lord's ministry, the Lord's Body, and the Lord's testimony had not been one, Paul would not have needed to go to Jerusalem, and there would have been no need for them to make a decision which covered not only the Jewish believers but also the Gentile believers.
[19]  In the United States, the Californians can say that they do not need to keep the laws in New York or Texas, and the people in Illinois can say that they would not keep the laws in California.
[20]  According to the decision made at the conference in Jerusalem, however, a principle was established that all the churches should keep the same kind of "law" and bear the same kind of testimony.
[21]  In their administration the churches might be different from one another in their locality, yet their testimony should still be one because they all are one Body under the one ministry and one move of the Lord.
[22]  The reason why I am sharing this at this time is because in the Lord's recovery over the entire earth, there are signs coming out to indicate that there is a certain realization that the churches in different regions under certain kinds of work have the freedom to be different.
[23]  Some may ask whether or not the receiving of a brother is a local administration matter or something related to the Body.
[24]  For a local church to receive a ministry that is different from the general ministry which produces the churches, establishes the churches, and is still edifying the churches affects the entire Body.
[25]  These three illustrations are good enough and strong enough to tell us that it is not right to think that just because we have a regional work with a few churches under this regional work, we have the full jurisdiction to do everything according to our choice without caring for the Lord's universal testimony, universal Body, universal ministry, and universal move.
[26]  Every local church does have its own jurisdiction, but whatever a local church does must be done in a careful consideration as to how this would affect the Lord's universal testimony, universal Body, universal move, and universal ministry.
[27]  I would like to give an illustration of what I mean by relating a situation among us in the past.
[28]  There was a certain local church which I loved and did my best to help and to keep it on the right way.
[29]  The Lord knows and some of the other brothers know how much I did my best to keep that church from going astray.
[30]  They claimed that the church in Los Angeles was just the training center and that it did not have the proper practice of the church life.
[31]  I told him that if he felt that their way was the right way to practice the church life, I would not say anything.
[32]  I also told him, though, that I did not think it was wise for him to go out and particularly to go to Atlanta and tell the saints there that Los Angeles is only good for a training center and does not have the proper church life.
[33]  I told him that it was not wise to tell other churches and other saints that the best way to practice the church was in their locality.
[34]  REGARDING THE ONE BODY TAKING CARE OF THE LORD'S TESTIMONY
[35]  Remember that you are not the only local church on this earth.
[36]  However, we must realize that it would have been wrong for the brothers in Judea to say that they were in one region and that Paul who was with the Gentile churches in another region should not bother them.
[37]  I must testify that I really treasure the Lord's one move through the one ministry to produce the one Body of Christ to bear the one testimony of Jesus, which is of God's New Testament economy.
[38]  The more I consider this point, the more I feel that this is marvelous and excellent that we could have such a reality on the earth today.
[39]  I do not care for position, I do not care for rank, and I do not care for anything; my heart is only for this one testimony.
[40]  CHAPTER FOUR THE REGION OF THE WORK 2 THE LOCAL CHURCH AND THE BODY, THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH
[41]  The Epistle to the Ephesians was not written in a clear way to tell us exactly to which church this book was addressed.
[42]  The tragedy is this: when Christians should pay attention to the local churches they take Ephesians as a refuge, saying that the church is universal; when they should take care of the universal testimony, they "run away" from Ephesians and take Revelation 1:11 as a refuge, saying that every local church has its own jurisdiction.
[43]  ONE MOVE THROUGH ONE MINISTRY TO PRODUCE AND BUILD ONE BODY FOR ONE TESTIMONY
[44]  In the New Testament, however, the revelation is more than clear that these two regions with the Jewish and Gentile churches were one move by the Lord through one ministry to produce and build one Body for one testimony.
[45]  We all must see that regardless of how many regions and how many workers there are, the Lord's testimony must be one because there are not two Lords or three Lords, but only one Lord moving on this earth.
[46]  The churches should not bear the flavor of their region and should not give people the impression that these are churches of a certain region.
[47]  Standing before the Lord and before all of you brothers, I want to give my testimony that I always check with myself in this way "how pure is your heart toward His recovery?
[48]  All the churches raised up by the work are not our churches.
[49]  In the New Testament there is only the church of God 1 Cor 1:2; 10:32 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16 , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33; 1 Thes 1:1 .
[50]  Every church is worth seeing because they are the churches of the Lord.
[51]  CHAPTER FIVE PRINCIPLES FOR THE LEADING ONES AND THE WORKERS
[52]  When you go out to minister, to speak, to visit, or to have fellowship, do not exercise yourself in a way to attract people to you or to your place.
[53]  Do not work and care for your local church or for the local churches in your territory, but for the Lord's recovery.
[54]  Even if you are working in your territory for the recovery, your consideration should always be that you are working for the Lord's recovery.
[55]  The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 5 that when we come to offer something to God, if we recall that someone is unhappy with us, we had better leave the offering there and get ourselves reconciled with the brother who has something against us vv.
[56]  CHAPTER SIX THE RECEIVING OF THE SAINTS 1 RECEIVING ALL THE BELIEVERS
[57]  How we receive all the saints determines whether or not we are a sect.
[58]  I may be a person living in my particular nature and in my peculiar disposition, which is always so straight and so insistent.
[59]  I am very strict about not receiving anyone whom I feel is not genuinely regenerated.
[60]  Romans 16:17-18 says, "Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.
[61]  For such men do not serve as slaves our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and by smooth and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple."
[62]  Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts them out of the church."
[63]  "Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son" v. 9 . If anyone comes to us and does not bring this teaching concerning Christ's deity, do not receive him into your house and do not say rejoice to him; do not greet him.
[64]  In this particular case, we should not greet such a one, we should not receive him into our house, and we surely should not receive him to the church meeting.
[65]  To stop a saint from coming to the Lord's table should not be done unless it is a case related to immorality, to idol worship, or to the heresy concerning the Lord's Person.
[66]  In the previous chapter, we studied portions of Scripture concerning the matter of cutting a saint off from the fellowship of the church.
[67]  "If anyone does not obey our word by this letter, mark this one that you may not associate with him, in order that he may be put to shame; and do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
[68]  According to our natural understanding, Paul charged us to reject this person because he says that we may not associate with him, which to us means that we should have nothing to do with him.
[69]  We have already seen that in Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus only used the word "let him be."
[70]  Matthew 18 shows us that we must do our best to fellowship with a sinning brother.
[71]  Also, I feel that we had better avoid using the word "excommunication" because we must leave the ground, the opening, for the sinning one to come back.
[72]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE POSITION AND FUNCTION OF THE ELDERS THE POSITION OF THE ELDERS
[73]  In this chapter we will have a thorough fellowship concerning the elders' position and function.
[74]  If we would drop the concept concerning rank, it would be easy for us to understand the matter of position.
[75]  Actually, I would say, strictly speaking, that the elders should not consider that they have any position.
[76]  Some who do not meet with us have already greatly misused Brother Nee's book Spiritual Authority.
[77]  When we say the elders have authority, we must not forget that the authority is not official.
[78]  According to 1 Timothy 3 and 5 we can see that the elders, first, have to manage the church just as a father manages his family, his house.
[79]  First Timothy 3:4-5 says concerning the elders, "One who manages well his own household, having his children in subjection with all gravity; But if anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?
[80]  As long as I labor in the Word, render the teaching to the saints, and open up the Word to all the seeking ones, I do not need to secure my position.
[81]  Some of the young ones among us may think that if they could not get a group of believers to work on, they would not have the security of their living.
[82]  If you really mean business with Him, you do not need to take care of your position, and you do not need to think about your living.
[83]  If you do not care for it and care only for the Lord's interest, which includes the healthy condition of the church in which you are and the recovery of the Lord, your position is heavily secured.
[84]  CHAPTER NINE PRACTICAL POINTS FOR THE ELDERS REPROVING A SINNING ELDER
[85]  In this chapter we will cover a number of crucial, practical points for the elders.
[86]  First, we want to look at a charge which Paul gave to Timothy concerning his dealings with the elders in 1 Timothy 5:19-20: "Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses.
[87]  Then there was a further move of the Lord through His lovers.
[88]  Also, we must realize that the small phrase "in love" is used six times in the book of Ephesians 1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15, 16; 5:2 .
[89]  When the elders who are taking care of the church deal with some sinning ones, they should not condemn his family.
[90]  If this brother would not repent after a long, long period of patience on the elders' side and if he would not give up his sinning life, this would force the church to remove him.
[91]  We must always keep in mind that the real, actual, and prevailing function of the elders is to minister life, to feed people.
[92]  I do not mean that we older ones should not help them, but there is a great temptation in helping them in these kinds of things.
[93]  Do not think that just because we are brothers in the church life who love one another that it is all right for us to do business with one another.
[94]  All of us love the Lord, love His recovery, love the church life, and love all the saints, but do not think that merely to have a loving heart is sufficient.
[95]  CHAPTER TEN THE CHINESE-SPEAKING WORK THE IMMIGRATION FACTOR
[96]  Since 1983 we have felt led of the Lord to take care of the Chinese-speaking work in the United States and in Canada.
[97]  When I first came to the United States, I had a clear feeling that I should not spend much time with the Chinese-speaking work in order to concentrate the work for the recovery among the English-speaking saints.
[98]  We need the Chinese-speaking meeting because a number of the immigrants who are the relatives and the parents of the young graduates do not know much English.
[99]  We are hoping that the Lord can raise up a number of young people who are bilingual to go full-time.
[100]  CHAPTER ELEVEN OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD FELLOW-BELIEVERS OUR VISION
[101]  The Lord has really opened up His Word to us since 1920 mainly through Brother Watchman Nee.
[102]  According to what the Lord has shown us through His holy Word, I would say that the Lord's testimony in the New Testament age is Christ as the all-inclusive One.
[103]  PRACTICING TO BEAR GOD'S TESTIMONY AS THE RETURNED REMNANT
[104]  We did not know much, but we saw divisions, organizations, and traditions in Christianity, which we could not follow according to the pure Word of God.
[105]  At the beginning, we did not see the genuine ground of the church, but we still realized that many of our dear brothers did not remain in the proper church life.
[106]  Due to the Japanese invasion of China, many of us were scattered, and I realized that that work was not so profitable to the Lord's recovery.
[107]  Therefore, I changed my concept and I did not go out but stayed in my home town of Chefoo for approximately five years, from 1938 through 1943.
[108]  In Shanghai I met Brother Nee again and presented all that I had experienced and had seen to him, including the things concerning the practical church life.
[109]  We do not deny that there are thousands and thousands of genuine believers scattered among all the denominations; we love them and we would like to share all the truths we have received from the Lord with them, if they would be open.
[110]  PREACHING THE GOSPEL, TEACHING THE TRUTH, AND MINISTERING LIFE
[111]  During these last twenty years, the Lord has established His recovery in the United States.
[112]  This is why we must train all the saints with the precious truths which we have received from the Lord that each one may be qualified and enabled to spread these truths by preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, and ministering life to people.
