<h2 class="head2">Wanting Man to Bear Responsibility&mdash;<br />
to Co-work and Cooperate with God</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:15 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.&rdquo; This verse says that God put Adam in the garden of Eden so that he would be responsible for two things: working and keeping. Adam&rsquo;s working the garden of Eden signifies the growth of life. The parable of the sower in Matthew 13 is in this principle (vv. 1-23). Hence, things growing out of the earth signify the life of God growing in man.</p>
<p>According to Genesis 2, in order for things to grow out of the earth, there must be both rain from heaven and a man to work the ground. Thus, concerning God&rsquo;s creation of man, this chapter says that it had not rained upon the earth and that there was no man to work the ground (vv. 4-6). This means that before man was created, God had not yet caused it to rain upon the earth, because there was no man on the earth, to cooperate with God. Consequently, life could not grow out of the ground. God fulfilled His responsibility when He created man and when the living water flowed out from God to water the earth (vv. 7, 10), but there was still another responsibility related to working the ground. Working symbolizes man cooperating with God so that the life of God can grow. God has His work, and man also has his work. God&rsquo;s work is to cause it to rain, and man&rsquo;s work is to work the ground.</p>
<p>In the parable of the sower the Lord Jesus spoke of man bearing the responsibility to deal with his heart after the seed of God had been sown into his heart (Matt. 13:3-9, 18-23). This dealing is symbolized by working the ground. After the life of God enters into man and the Spirit of God is sent down as rain, man still has the responsibility to deal with his heart. If man accepts this responsibility, the life of God will grow in the man of dust through his cooperation with God. The first responsibility that God wanted man to bear corresponds to the first aspect of His purpose, which is for man to have His life and live in Him in order to be like Him.</p>
<p>The second responsibility that God wanted man to bear was to keep, to guard, the garden. Guarding indicates dealing with the enemy. Man needed to guard the garden because there is a robber, an enemy, in the universe&mdash;Satan. Guarding corresponds to the second aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose. God put man in the garden of Eden to bear the responsibilities of working the ground and guarding the garden so that man would have the life of God, live in Him, be like Him, and deal with His enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Warning Man&mdash;Giving Man a Prohibition</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:16-17 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; Here God gave man a warning, a prohibition. God told man that the tree of knowledge was off limits. Man was not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because if he contacted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would die. Since the tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to everything outside of God, the significance of God&rsquo;s prohibition is that man should contact only God; he should not contact anything outside of God. This prohibition is very severe. If God by His grace enlightens us to see this word, we would prostrate ourselves before Him, and we would no longer dare to touch anything outside of Him, because whenever we touch something outside of God, the result will be death. We must see the seriousness of this warning.</p>
<p>After reading the Bible, some people say, &ldquo;God is too jealous. He does not want us to love anything other than Him. Loving anything outside of Him is death.&rdquo; This is true indeed, because man was not created for anything other than God. Man was created for God; thus, God has the unique authority over man. Man is solely for God; therefore, man should not touch anything outside of God. People today touch many things outside of God. Unbelievers aside, even those of us who are saved touch things outside of God much of the time. Every day we are touching things outside of God; every day we are touching death. No wonder we are all so dead at the bread-breaking meeting. To touch things outside of God is to touch death; only to touch God is to touch life.</p>
<p>Today the universe is like the garden of Eden, containing God and the things outside of God. What will we choose? If we choose God, who is life, the issue will be life. If we choose things outside of God, which are the embodiment of Satan, the issue will be death. Some believers cannot open their mouth to praise or pray in the bread-breaking meeting because they love their children too much. With others their love of knowledge prevents them from opening their mouth. Some love their status, others love their clothing, and still others love their jobs. To love these is to choose things that are outside of God, and the result is to choose death. Hence, God warned man that everything outside of God is off limits. When we touch anything outside of God, we touch death. This is a warning and a prohibition. God prohibited man from touching anything other than Him. When man touches things other than God, he is corrupted and falls into death.</p>
