<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The New Covenant&#151;Its Content<br>and Ultimate Consummation</H2><P>Before He died on the cross for our redemption, the Lord Jesus established the new covenant. At His table He enacted a law to be the new covenant (Luke 22:20). All the New Testament books from Acts through Revelation tell us what the new covenant is. The content of this new covenant is the Triune God within us to be our life, our life law, our life supply, our life capacity, and our everything that we may be constituted with God in His life and nature and thereby become His increase, His enlargement, to be His fullness for His eternal expression. First, this expression is the church; second, it is the kingdom; and eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, it is the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the new covenant of God to express God in a corporate way to the uttermost for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Nations around the New Jerusalem</H2><P>In the new heaven and new earth, this corporate expression will be observed by the nations, which will live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light (Rev. 21:24).</P><P>These items from Genesis through Revelation show us the spiritual sequence in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRITUAL SEQUENCE IN THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH</H2><P>Now we need to see that Jeremiah wrote his book of prophecy according to the sequence of the spiritual things recorded in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Presenting Himself to Israel as the Source<br>and Israel Forsaking Him to Take Their Own Way</H2><P>First, Jeremiah shows us that God presented Himself to Israel as the source, the fountain, of living waters to be their rich supply. But Israel forsook Him to take their own way, to hew out for themselves cisterns of rock (Jer. 2:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Israel Becoming Evil</H2><P>Having forsaken God as the source, Israel became evil, manifesting the wickedness within them and having a heart that was deceitful above all things and incurable (17:9). Not only so, their nature was so evil, wicked, and corrupt that nothing could change it (13:23). They became just like the people whom Jesus met in the four Gospels.</P>
