[1]  Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5:
[2]  There are close to eight hundred saints who are burdened for the work in the schools.
[3]  We rejoice that the saints are burdened to focus on the gospel work.
[4]  We must fellowship and pray together concerning the way to advance in the gospel work in the junior high schools, high schools, and colleges.
[5]  The most crucial matter in a scientific approach is to conduct thorough research.
[6]  We should do research from a number of perspectives to obtain statistics.
[7]  The ideal way for us to improve our preaching of the gospel is to use videotapes and even television.
[8]  It would be wonderful if every household on the island of Taiwan could watch the church preaching the gospel and hear people say, Praise the Lord!
[9]  If we do not know how to be a proper person, we can never know how to do things, and if we do not know how to do things, we can never labor for the Lord.
[10]  A number of saints in the church are serving either part time or full time, and still more saints have a heart to serve full time.
[11]  When the work began in Taiwan, this generation of young people was not born yet.
[12]  We should make a list of the saints in the five categories mentioned above.
[13]  Then every district should make a list of the schools in which our saints are either staff or students and include the names of the saints.
[14]  Propagating the gospel in schools can be compared to fighting on the frontline of a war.
[15]  Many schools are the object of our work, the target of our warfare, so we need to consider how much manpower we can afford to invest.
[16]  If a school looks promising for the gospel work, those who labor in that school should consider moving close to it.
[17]  We can start either a brothers house or a sisters house with three or four students.
[18]  Such an apartment does not need to be large, but it needs to have a living room where we can receive students.
[19]  We need to take the college students to the mountains many times, at least twice a year.
[20]  Question: What should we say if people ask us why we do not participate in a campus-wide fellowship involving other Christian groups?
[21]  Answer: This matter is related to the truth of the church Matt 16:18; 18:17 .
[22]  The Lord Jesus has only one Body in the universe, and this Body is His universal church.
[23]  We therefore may not be able to cover everything thoroughly in a few messages.
[24]  What we have fellowshipped, in principle, is based on many years of observation.
[25]  When we begin the work, there will be many more things that we will need to learn.
[26]  For example, the school administration may exercise strict oversight, and the students may have a very regimented schedule with little free time.
[27]  With such campuses, we must keep the principle of not disrupting the order.
[28]  We need to learn to do everything in the Lord s service without legality.
[29]  This, however, does not mean that we do not have regulations.
[30]  Calling on the Lord s name or pray-reading His Word is not a problem, and it is not necessarily true that those who pray-read the Word are more spiritual than those who do not.
[31]  Those who are burdened to preach the gospel in the schools or in the community must learn the truth of the gospel.
[32]  To learn the truth can be compared to receiving an education.
[33]  A person who has an elementary school education speaks and behaves with the flavor of elementary school; a person who has a high school education speaks and behaves with the flavor of high school; and a person who has a college education speaks and behaves with the flavor of college.
[34]  Another book, Gospel Outlines , contains outlines on specific topics from Genesis through Revelation.
[35]  TRYING OUR BEST TO GET INTO THE MINISTRY BOOKS
[36]  While many seminary students are studying in seminaries, they prepare fifty-two topics that they will use weekly after they graduate and become pastors.
[37]  What we publish in the Lord s recovery contains life and truth, not empty doctrine.
[38]  In one letter the writers said that they spent money to buy books from other places but did not gain any benefit even after reading twenty to forty pages; however, they gained something from the first page of our publication.
[39]  SPREADING THE BENEFIT OF THE LORD S RECOVERY TO THE ENTIRE EARTH
[40]  These examples show that what we are cultivated in influences the next generation.
[41]  What we planted spread from mainland China to Taiwan and even overseas.
[42]  This proves that all the situations in the world today are to facilitate the Lord s move.
[43]  This also shows that the seed of the gospel that we plant, the truth that we release, and the divine life that we supply are of manifold value.
[44]  Concerning preaching the gospel in schools, we still need to fellowship regarding the aspect of life.
[45]  As persons who serve the Lord, we first need to learn and exercise to be persons of prayer.
[46]  Another thing that needs our attention related to prayer is the matter of being watchful.
[47]  The Lord Jesus often put being watchful together with prayer.
[48]  It is a unique view in which a person perceives the need and recognizes what should be done.
[49]  Generally speaking, most people who like to voice their opinions do not have much insight; that is, their view is not clear.
[50]  We are serving the Lord together, we have spent many years in the church, and we have all kinds of meetings.
[51]  The greatest problem in the church life is our opinions.
[52]  Since we love the church and expect our church to be thriving and prosperous, we must bury our opinions.
[53]  After I entered the work of the Lord s recovery, I never chose where to work.
[54]  Most of the time I was sent to a place where the work was experiencing difficulty, but by the Lord s mercy I never made my own choices.
[55]  Even though Peter, John, and James were always together, in John 21 the Lord told Peter, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go v. 18 . In verse 21 Peter asked what John s future would be, and the Lord replied, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me v. 22 . The Lord s response implied that they must not have anything natural among them.
[56]  We need to divide the gospel into four lines.
[57]  We need to encourage every brother and sister in the small groups to open their home.
[58]  We should encourage all the saints, whether they are strong, weak, or only occasionally attend a meeting, to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel.
[59]  We are not promoting the preaching of the gospel in the small groups; we are encouraging every saint in a small group to open his home and preach the gospel in his home.
[60]  According to statistics, the city of Taipei has about one hundred ten thousand college students and two hundred sixty thousand students in junior high school and high school This is a total of three hundred seventy thousand students.
[61]  We should not only preach the gospel to the children but also labor on the children with weekly children s meetings.
[62]  In practice, if the saints open their homes for the gospel, they should invite people with the same occupation.
[63]  This is the way we should take if we want to preach the gospel to working people.
[64]  If we can have thorough fellowship with the working saints in the twenty-one halls in the church in Taipei so that they open their homes to preach the gospel to their colleagues at work, the church will flourish, prosper, and bear new fruit every month.
[65]  All the full-timers and part-timers over thirty years old should take the lead to open their homes.
[66]  If the church assigns the older sisters who are full time to preach the gospel, they should first pray for people, then go and distribute tracts to their homes, and then visit them.
[67]  In the past, according to our concept of the church life, we did not focus on the children s work.
[68]  However, with the development of human society and culture, there has been more social and educational emphasis put on children.
[69]  If children s education is not developed, it will be difficult to have a healthy society.
[70]  God ordained that man be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth Gen 1:28 .
[71]  Thus, man has multiplied, but how do we raise our children?
[72]  Many years ago we did not know that children could be a great potential for the gospel.
[73]  We stressed preaching the gospel but neglected the fact that children could also be the fruit of the gospel.
[74]  When we realized that children could also be considered fruit of the gospel, I fellowshipped with the brothers, asking them to work with the goal of having ten thousand children in Taipei.
[75]  There is not a definite way to take care of the children s work.
[76]  There should be many locations for the children s work, meetings can be held at different times, and we can use different methods to conduct the children s meetings.
[77]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You from the depth of our being.
[78]  Touch each of us in our inward being so that we would be willing to let You have the first place, to exalt You, and to let You possess us completely so that we can be a people on the earth who glorify You and live in Your glory.
[79]  We pray that by Your Spirit of grace You would transmit Your will, heart, thoughts, and even feeling into each of us so that we would have the same heart and the same mind and that we would testify that we have been joined to You as one spirit.
[80]  If the twenty-one meeting halls in the church in Taipei were separate from one another, it would not be difficult to administrate and promote the work.
[81]  However, according to the Bible, even though there are six to seven thousand saints meeting and serving in Taipei, there is only one church.
[82]  Hence, it is not easy to administrate the church.
[83]  Therefore, after spending much time before the Lord in consideration, we feel that the Lord has given us a way.
[84]  It may be possible for older brothers to take the lead in a smaller church with seventy to eighty saints, but in a church as large as Taipei, which has twenty-one meeting halls and many saints in each meeting hall, the older brothers are bound to feel a lack in their physical ability even though they have insight and experience.
[85]  Since we are taking the way of separating the halls and yet administrating together, there is the need to pay attention to the separate aspect and to the together aspect.
[86]  The six current elders, who are older, should bear the responsibility of matters concerning the whole church, whereas the newly appointed elders, who are between thirty and fifty years of age, should concentrate on mobilizing the twenty-one meeting halls.
[87]  Since we have learned the lesson, there will be a number of conditions in our appointing of these elders.
[88]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE SERVICE OF THE ELDERS AND DEACONS IN THE CHURCH 1
[89]  In order for the service and the leading in the church in Taipei to have a new beginning, we want to have some fellowship and leading for the newly appointed elders and deacons.
[90]  We will first fellowship concerning the Lord s move in the church in Taipei as well as on the island of Taiwan.
[91]  Even though we were hindered in some aspects of the work and have not completely followed the Lord s leading, the Lord has kept us so that His testimony has been maintained.
[92]  When we began, our scope in the work was not large, but by the Lord s blessing we now have a rich heritage.
[93]  Therefore, I received a burden from the Lord for the past eleven years to preserve in printed form all the truth and light and knowledge of the Bible that we have received from the Lord so that these precious messages would not be lost.
[94]  We hope that everyone will participate in this new beginning.
[95]  If the saints are strong in the truth and in life, the Lord s recovery will progress, but if the saints are weak in truth and life, the Lord s recovery has no future.
[96]  Some elders and deacons among us are not able to speak about the mystery of the faith.
[97]  If we do not know the mystery of the faith, how can we hold it?
[98]  The mystery of the faith refers mainly to Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .
[99]  We were saved, we loved the Lord, and we stood in the Lord s recovery for the Lord s testimony, but our testimony was a testimony of morality instead of a testimony of Christ.
[100]  Now we would like to fellowship concerning our practice.
[101]  In order to lead the church and give accurate direction, we must have sufficient knowledge of the Bible.
[102]  THE LORD NOT WANTING US TO BE LEADERS There Being No Leader among the Apostles
[103]  There are many portions in the New Testament that show that the Lord does not want anyone to be a leader.
[104]  For example, among five members of a board of directors for a school, a president must be elected, or at least a convener must be chosen.
[105]  In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, but He did not appoint a chief apostle among them, nor did they elect a leader among themselves.
[106]  The elders should communicate in the way of fellowship, instead of taking a superior position to speak to a saint who is serving as a deacon.
[107]  This message is concerned with the elders responsibilities, the service of the deacons, and the relationship between the elders and the deacons.
[108]  The third responsibility of an elder is to shepherd.
[109]  In Acts 20:28 Paul said to the elders in Ephesus, Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.
[110]  In this verse shepherding does not refer to being the head sheep but to being a shepherd.
[111]  In addition to the elders leading, teaching, shepherding, and promoting, in a local church there is still a need for the deacons visitation.
[112]  There are many names on our list, but less than half the saints come to the meetings regularly, because there is a lack in visitation.
[113]  These saints should know the truth, have some growth in life, love the brothers and sisters, and have a heart to serve the Lord.
[114]  Even though we may accomplish much, we still have to return to the Lord s presence and remember His word in Luke 17:10: When you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.
[115]  We need to consider what 1 Timothy 3 says concerning the person of the elders and deacons.
[116]  However, if we read only this chapter, we may think that it shows rank.
[117]  Romans 12:4-5 says, Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
[118]  IN THE WAY OF COMPELLING PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Luke 14:15-23
[119]  In order for the church life to have a new beginning, we need to promote and carry out the small groups.
[120]  The goal of promoting the small groups is first to bring in new ones, then to recover those who have not been meeting, and lastly to uphold the saints who meet regularly.
[121]  The Second Stage of Preaching the Gospel Targeting the Gentiles
[122]  In the second stage God sent people to the Gentiles.
[123]  In the eyes of the Jews, the Gentiles were poor, crippled, blind, and lame v. 21 . Yet God said to invite such people.
[124]  When I was young I saw the Western missionaries who came to my hometown.
[125]  This stage requires that we go out to the roads and the hedges to compel people.
[126]  The increase and spread of a church is entirely dependent on its widespread preaching of the gospel.
[127]  If we understand that the Lord s heart is to cause His church to increase and spread, we will preach the gospel widely.
[128]  If we do not have one full-timer for every twenty saints, we cannot give an account to the Lord, and the Lord will not have a way among us.
[129]  Full-timers Not Being the Hirelings of the Church
[130]  Concerning the administration of the full-time brothers and sisters, they are not directed by the elders.
[131]  Acts 13:1-3 says, There were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers...And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
[132]  According to my knowledge of God, I would like to advise the saints not to be calculating with God.
[133]  We must give one-tenth of whatever the Lord gives us as our income for His use.
[134]  Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities v. 17 . Then to the one who gained five minas He said, You, be over five cities v. 19 . But to the one who did not gain even one mina, the Lord said, Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas...I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away vv.
[135]  In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the way to preach the gospel.
[136]  Stanza 1 of Hymns, #1068, a gospel song, says, In tenderness He sought me, / Weary and sick with sin, / And on His shoulders brought me / Into His flock again.
[137]  THE BIBLE SPEAKING OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT AS WELL AS SALVATION
[138]  We believe in the Lord, and we also believe the Bible.
[139]  The Bible not only speaks of salvation but also of reward and punishment.
[140]  In 1 Corinthians 9:16-17 Paul says, If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.
[141]  If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.
[142]  I preached the gospel because I loved the Lord, but why would I become woeful if I did not preach the gospel?
[143]  Prayer: Lord, we ask You to remember us as we are here for Your recovery.
[144]  By Your precious blood and through You as our sin offering and trespass offering, we enter into Your presence.
[145]  We confess that we are still weak and full of failures and that we are lacking in many ways.
[146]  IN ORDER TO BE STRONG, LIVING, HIGH, AND RICH
[147]  We have all been in the Lord s recovery for quite some time, but we do not know how to lead the small groups.
[148]  A person who receives a complete education spends a couple of years in preschool, six years in primary school, three years in junior high, another three years in high school, and then four years in college.
[149]  After years of experience we know that in order for a meeting to be rich, strong, living, and high, there must be the Lord s word.
[150]  It is very profitable to use the Life-study messages in the small groups.
[151]  I am full of confidence that the Life-study of Galatians is not only useful but also timely medicine.
[152]  Some of the saints know how to meet in a small group and some do not.
[153]  This message says that Matthew s gospel is the gospel of the kingdom, John s gospel is the gospel of life, Luke s gospel is the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, Mark s gospel is the gospel of service, and Paul s gospel is the gospel of completion.
[154]  If we desire the small group meeting to be enjoyable, we need to be faithful to use the Life-studies.
[155]  Whenever we come to a crucial point in the Life-study message, we should repeat it.
[156]  Every one of us should learn to lead the small group and should focus on the crucial points in each Life-study message.
[157]  We should speak on the second message of the Life-study of Galatians until everyone can say that the crucial points of Paul s gospel are Christ is in us as the hope of glory, Christ is living in us, Christ is being formed in us, Christ is making His home in us, and we are being filled with Christ to become the fullness of God.
[158]  Prayer: Lord, we praise You for revealing Yourself in us and for living in us.
[159]  Grant all Your children to be brought into a real experience of You, eating You every day, being mingled with You, living by You, enjoying You, and allowing You to enjoy us.
[160]  As the Lord of our life in the church, we pray that You would lead us, supply us, and encourage us.
[161]  I believe that now all the brothers and sisters have seen that the small group is the way to build up the church, the way to gain people, the way to shepherd others, and the way for mutual care.
[162]  If we do not go forward on this way, there is no other way that we can take, because this is truly the way of the Lord.
[163]  Whether a meeting is good or bad is not determined by a method but by whether we enjoy the Lord.
[164]  After each meeting we must ask ourselves whether the Lord s word was opened to us and whether we touched the riches in His word.
[165]  If the Lord s word was not opened to us and we did not touch the riches in His word, then we need to reconsider what profits us.
[166]  I have observed that some small groups are going on strongly, but others are not doing so well.
[167]  I have studied this situation with some brothers, and we came up with ten factors that deaden a small group.
[168]  A small group that suffers from one of these ten factors will fall into a deadened situation.
[169]  Every Lord s Day morning more than three thousand saints listen to Your word; we do not want to take this matter lightly.
[170]  The brothers serving in the word must have a burden.
[171]  Message 1 of Life-study of Galatians says that Galatians, the first of four books that make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament, is concerned with Christ.
[172]  We must study to find out what kind of Christ is presented in Galatians.
[173]  If Message 1 does not give us enough detail, we should read the footnotes, and if there is no explanation in the footnotes, we should consider which Life-study speaks of Christ.
[174]  We must be very careful when we touch the matter of ministering the Lord s word.
[175]  It is not an easy task to touch the Lord s holy Word, so we must see the importance of this matter.
[176]  However, I am concerned that we esteem the Lord s word too lightly; we have not given serious regard to the matter of speaking for the Lord.
[177]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12; 2 Cor 12:15; 8:12-15
[178]  However, even though many are familiar with this doctrine, few live the life of the Body of Christ.
[179]  On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved.
[180]  After that there were big meetings in the temple.
[181]  If Peter had not been a speaker in a meeting, John would have been.
[182]  This was absolutely good for them at that time, because except for the one hundred twenty who prayed in the upper room, none of the other Jews knew the gospel.
[183]  There are currently about three hundred sixty small groups in the church in Taipei.
[184]  Every small group should bring in one new one every week.
[185]  Then there will be three hundred sixty new ones every week, and there will be close to one thousand five hundred new ones in four weeks.
[186]  This burden should not fall only on the elders; instead, each member in the small groups should pick up the burden to care for the saints who have not been meeting for a long time.
[187]  THE LORD S MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Acts 1:8
[188]  Even though I have been in America, for the past five years my heart has been in Taiwan.
[189]  I have been observing and continually seeking in which direction the Lord desires for us to move.
[190]  During the past thirty years, no less than five to six thousand people were baptized in the church in Kaohsiung.
[191]  If we want the Lord to have an outlet and for the gospel to spread, every brother and sister should have the attitude of spending their money, energy, and person for the sake of the gospel.
[192]  I have been serving full time in the Lord s recovery for over fifty years.
