   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE BEING NO HEAD CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 15 reveals a few basic principles in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the record in this chapter shows us that in the early days among the churches there was no head church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians believe that Jerusalem was the early headquarters of the church, controlling and giving orders to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, in Acts 15 we can see that this was not so because the decision was not made by the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>NO LOCAL CHURCH MAKING DECISIONS AFFECTING THE OTHER CHURCHES WITHOUT FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second principle revealed in Acts 15 is that no church should make a decision by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problem arose in the church at Antioch when some came and taught that the Gentile believers had to be circumcised according to the Old Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was absolutely against the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because Paul, who was the apostle to the Gentiles, and Barnabas could not tolerate this false teaching, they brought about much dissension and discussion v. 2 . However, neither they nor the church in Antioch made a decision concerning this matter, because they did not assume that they had the authority to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul did not presume that he was a king to make the final decision or give orders to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul, Peter, and James were among those who gathered in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These ones are considered to be great names in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, according to Acts 15, they conducted themselves merely as brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter and James addressed the others as brothers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>7, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that they did not presume that they had a higher position than others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to read Acts 15 several times in order to get into the spirit of this chapter and see what kind of atmosphere there was at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The atmosphere indicates that there was no human authority or head.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a principle in God s administration, no single local church should presume to make a decision regarding the truth or in other matters affecting the other churches without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Accordingly, the church at Antioch sent Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Paul and Barnabas were apostles, they did not decide to go on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, they were directed to go by the brothers v. 2 . This word is repeated in verse 3, which says, Having been sent forward by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul and Barnabas being sent forward by the church indicates that the church was higher than they were.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At most, they were representatives of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only were Paul and Barnabas sent, but certain others were sent also v. 2 . This indicates that Paul and Barnabas were not kings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The record in Acts 15 shows that no human being presumed to be a head or authority above others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS REPRESENTING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third principle revealed in Acts 15 is that not only the apostles but also the elders represented the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This chapter describes a conference of apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No one attended the conference as a prophet because the prophets do not represent the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The apostles and the elders were included because in God s administration the apostles represent the universal church, and the elders represent their respective local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE CONFERENCE IN ACTS 15 INCLUDING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MUCH DISCUSSION, TESTIMONIES,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>AND CONFIRMATION FROM THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fourth principle revealed in Acts 15 concerns the head of a conference of apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is difficult to say who was presiding over this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems that James gave the concluding, deciding word, but no one gave an opening word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 7 shows that this conference opened with much discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not know who began the discussion, but it must have lasted a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the discussion Peter rose up and spoke regarding his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one can argue with history.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peter told the brothers what he had seen and personally experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was no disagreement that God had visited and saved many Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In verse 9 Peter said that God made no distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles and that because God had cleansed the Gentiles hearts by faith, there was no need for them to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After Peter s testimony the others were silent because they were convinced v. 12a .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 12b says, They listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Paul and Barnabas are mentioned in chapter 15, sometimes Paul is listed first, but other times Barnabas is listed first.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verse 12 Barnabas is first.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is some significance here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It appears that there is a shift in Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the first part of chapter 13 and earlier, Barnabas s name is always recorded first 11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then in the middle of chapter 13 Paul begins to be mentioned first 13:42-43, 46, 50; 15:2, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, this does not mean that after Acts 13 Paul always took the lead 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 15 twice mentions Barnabas first in important circumstances vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>12, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In inspiring the writing of the Holy Scriptures, the Spirit indicated that there is no fixed leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One brother takes the lead today, but another brother may take the lead tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must see that Paul was not always the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Barnabas and Paul also testified according to their personal history and experience, telling the others how God had done signs and wonders among the Gentiles through them, and then held their peace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the testimonies of Peter, Barnabas, and Paul, the whole company was silenced.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is possible to argue concerning doctrines, opinions, and ideas, but no one can argue with historical facts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, there was no more discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, they did not make a decision by voting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead, James said, Men, brothers, listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take out from them a people for His name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And with this the words of the prophets agree vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then he quoted some prophecies from the Old Testament to show that what Peter, Barnabas, and Paul had testified agreed with the word of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After much discussion and a few testimonies, James, a brother who knew the Scriptures, quoted from God s Word to confirm the testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The account in Acts 15 is quite valuable because it allows us to see that there was discussion among the early apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is wrong to think that we need to avoid discussion in order to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only when a king is present can there be no discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every meeting of the elders should include much discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should discuss, but no one should insist on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need to be fully open.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No one should merely be a yes-man, agreeing with whatever is said regardless of his true feeling, because we all have been born again, love the Lord, and have Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We also have a spirit and can exercise discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Much discussion took place in the presence of Peter, James, and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>These three were not kings, because their presence did not silence the others.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The kingship was fully preserved for God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The only King is God, and we are all His subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should never say that no one else should speak when a certain brother is present.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a wrong concept and an insult to the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The conference in Acts 15 progressed from discussion to testimonies and then to confirmation from God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the right way in God s administration to reach a decision regarding problems among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There should be no human authority.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After James quoted the Word of God, he must have received authorization from the Lord, because he boldly said, Therefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God v. 19 . James received and transmitted the King s decree.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This also shows us that we should not make decisions according to our experience alone.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There must be confirmation from the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Any experience that cannot be confirmed by the Word should not be a deciding factor.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The final factor of any decision must be the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Peter did not have the boldness to make a decision based solely on his experience, nor did Barnabas or Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Only after hearing the testimonies and finding confirmation in the Word of God did James utter a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The authority was not with James but with the word he quoted from the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Because James found confirmation in the Word, he did not make a humble suggestion but spoke with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We can see the wisdom of James in his closing word.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The judgment he spoke was according to the holy Word and corresponded with the testimonies of the experienced ones.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This decision covered all the necessary aspects and met all the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We need to learn all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Verse 22 says, It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This wonderful record shows that although the conference was a gathering of apostles and elders, the decision was made with the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The apostles and the elders considered that what they decided should be acceptable to the whole church.</S>
