This is wrong. An announcement does not have the authority to allow the announced ones to break bread. This is not the teaching of the Bible. Some may say, "Did you not say only those who have been publicly recommended can break bread?" No, it is not true that only those who have been publicly recommended can break bread. Rather, there is the need of two or three brothers or sisters to recommend a person to us by telling us that this brother or sister has really been born again, and that they are now recommending him to break bread with us. Indeed, the most important qualification to break bread is not a matter of announcement or recommendation; it is a matter of whether or not a person has been regenerated. Announcements and recommendations are not the qualification. The qualification is whether or not a person is born again. The only qualification which we insist on is that a person be regenerated. If he is regenerated, we can recommend him to break bread. Therefore, recommendations and announcements do not count. Only regeneration counts.</P><P>Some may ask, "I have been born again. Why do you not allow me to break bread?" Brothers and sisters, you need to know the difference between the Body of Christ and the household of God. The members of the Body of Christ are hidden, while the members of the household of God are different; they are open. The affairs within the household of God need to be witnessed by two or three people. It is not enough for you alone to testify that you are born again, because you are only one person; there is the need for two or three other persons to testify before the matter can be settled.</P><P>Regarding the doctrinal aspect, I do not wish to say any more. We have thoroughly elaborated on it in our Bible study meetings. Regarding the practical aspect, we already made the decision during yesterday afternoon's prayer meeting. If someone wants to break bread with us, we need to announce it in the Lord's Day's morning meeting like this, "Today Brother So-and-so or Sister So-and-so requests to break bread with us. We will ask those brothers and sisters who know him or her to testify whether he or she is born again." At the end of the meeting, some may inform the responsible brothers and sisters. If you know that a person is regenerated and saved, he can be received into the breaking of bread. If you know that a person is a fornicator, a covetous man, an idolater, a reviler, a drunkard, a rapacious man, or if he is unsaved, he cannot break bread with us. Regarding this matter, it is the duty not only of the responsible brothers and sisters but also of every brother and sister.</P><P>If the person who requests to break bread with us does not have a letter of recommendation, and if none among the brothers and sisters in our meetings know about him; then (at least) two of the responsible brothers or sisters should meet with him, fellowship the truth with him, and find out whether or not he is regenerated and whether or not he has accepted the Lord Jesus. Our brothers or sisters will then tell us at the prayer meeting Thursday afternoon whether or not this person is saved and regenerated. If he is saved and regenerated, we can accept him to break bread the following Lord's Day. If this person is not saved and regenerated, we cannot accept him on the Lord's Day. If these two brothers or sisters have doubts and cannot decide, then the person should wait awhile.</P><P>Why are two people needed? Because it is easy for one to be mistaken. In the Bible only the testimonies of two people are counted. Also, if there is only one person, and he is very agreeable, he may hastily assume that this person is saved. If there is a second person, he can check the first one and suggest that this person's salvation is not yet reliably demonstrated and that they should wait a while and decide later. One person's testimony may not be reliable. We need two people to testify together; then we can avoid the danger of having unsaved people being mixed in at the Lord's table. It is not enough to take a person's own word that he is regenerated. We still need to examine this person because sometimes such persons may not really be regenerated.</P><P>The Lord's table is for the Lord's people. Whoever is born again can break bread. Nevertheless, we need to remember that only those who believe in the Lord and are born again can break bread. Whoever does not believe in the Lord and is not born again must not break bread. Therefore, aside from those who are born again, we do not need to ask others to visit our meetings. Nevertheless, if someone wishes to sit in, we naturally cannot refuse him.</P><P>Therefore, I do not think that the Lord wants us to stop people at the door of the meeting hall and ask them if they are born again. This would be confusing and would also create opportunities both for those who are not born again and for those who are born again but have fallen into the six kinds of sins described in 1 Corinthians 5 to sneak into our midst. Since the testimony of one person does not count according to the Bible, the simplest and most effective way is to announce to the congregation one week ahead in the Lord's Day morning meeting that a certain one requests to break bread with us. If there are testimonies from two or three people, we may receive him on the next Lord's Day. If there is no witness who knows him, we may ask two or three brothers to meet with him and talk with him. These two or three brothers will then testify for him in the prayer meeting as to whether or not he is born again. This will decide if we can receive him on the following Lord's Day.</P><P>I have one more word to say. Anyone who is born again will not be impatient, annoyed, and will not become unsaved because of the numerous questions. For example, I am Fukienese; regardless of how many times you question me, I am still Fukienese. I will not become a Shanghainese because of your questions. Therefore, whoever is born again is always born again, because whatever is yes is always yes and will stand the testing. Following our announcement and investigation, we can decide what steps to take at the prayer meeting on Thursday afternoon. After we have made the decision, we can announce in the morning meeting on the next Lord's Day whether or not we have received this person.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> </body></html>
