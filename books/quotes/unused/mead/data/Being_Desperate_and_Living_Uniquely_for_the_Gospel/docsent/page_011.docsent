   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AGGRESSIVE DESPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For years many of us have been drugged persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person who is drugged is numb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He does not have any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of us did not bear any fruit for twenty years, yet still felt that we were okay.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of the churches have been under a drugged situation for years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all have been meeting in our localities week after week and year after year with hardly any increase.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be warned to wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Any branch that does not bear fruit will be cut off John 15:2, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is this not serious?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have talked much concerning abiding in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But have we entered into the reality of abiding in John 15, and do we realize the seriousness of not bearing fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To take a branch away from a tree is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After being taken away, the branch loses everything of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may still be meeting in the name of Christ and have no realization that you have been taken away already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this fellowship, I do not care for the expounding or interpreting of the Lord's word in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, I hope you would be impressed with the seriousness of not bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Any branch that bears no fruit will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may have been taken away unconsciously already under your drugged situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may say that you enjoy Christ, but where is the enjoyment if you have not borne fruit and have been cut off from the vine tree?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How could you enjoy the vine tree?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is solemn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have to see how much we have been fooled and drugged by the tradition, the background, and the surrounding of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Millions of Christians are drugged, but we have to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Saints, wake up!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a brother among you, I am shouting, sounding, and even crying to you you have to wake up!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Lord is real and the Bible is a true book, it is solemn and serious to be a Christian without bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may have been cut off, taken away, already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why you may not have had any enjoyment of Christ for years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You got cut off from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The elders and co-workers need to consider this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may have been in the Lord's recovery for many years, but what have we been doing?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may have been carrying out things in a drugged way, and we may even be drugging others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you ever seen a fruit tree in an orchard that did not bear fruit year after year?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Would the husbandman still keep that tree?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He would not just cut off the branches, but uproot the entire tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God intended to uproot Israel because Israel did not bear fruit for years Luke 13:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How about the church today?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Look at today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Four of the five major denominations in Protestant Christianity are decreasing in number.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are the Episcopalian, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the Southern Baptists are increasing, but their rate of increase is still very low only about 1.4 percent yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The rate of increase among the Assemblies of God runs first only at six percent yearly, while the United Pentecostals have had an increase of less than five percent yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is still too low.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the past twenty-three years the highest rate of increase we had was around forty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in the last ten years since we suffered from the defamation of some books, our yearly rate of increase has dropped to about three percent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have blamed the opposition and have taken the excuse of the opposition for our barrenness, but do you believe that with the apostles there was no opposition?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why would we not wake up to do something?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is time for all of us to wake up, especially the elders and co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must take another way.</S>
