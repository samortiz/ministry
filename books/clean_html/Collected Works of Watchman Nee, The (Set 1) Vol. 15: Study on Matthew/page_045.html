<P>Verses 5-6:The second kind of seed is the seed that fell on the rocky places. These are places where there are rocks underneath and shallow soil on top. The deeper the seed is sown, the later it will grow; the shallower the seed is sown, the earlier it will grow because the shallow one is the first to receive the sunlight. See verses 20 to 21 for the explanation. This is the condition of those who are revived especially through revival meetings. For example, in John 2, many believed into the Lord when they saw the signs which He did. However, their believing was different from the believing mentioned in John 3, and the Lord did not entrust Himself to them (John 2:23-24). Many were crowding around the Lord, but not many touched Him (Luke 8:43-48). Many zealous ones crowd around the Lord, but they do not touch the Lord. Those who crowd around the Lord do so merely because of temporary excitement.</P><P>However, this kind of people is not yet regenerated, because the rocks have not yet been removed. Ezekiel 36:26 says that those who are regenerated have their stony heart removed. Those who have not entered deeply will go out easily. Many can easily have a display, but actually they have not obtained anything. Because they have no depth of earth, the seeds immediately spring up and can easily make a display. The Lord said that people of this kind do not have root in themselves but have rocks underneath the surface. Their soil is borrowed from the outside, and the sprout is not life but a mere momentary display of emotion. The Lord said that they are not saved.</P><P>Furthermore, trials and persecutions are for helping the believers to grow. All the north winds are for helping the trees to grow firmly. If the seed has no root, it cannot withstand persecution and affliction. If the seed is rooted, the scorching of the sun will help the seed to grow. If the seed is not rooted, the scorching of the sun will cause the seed to wither.</P><P>Verses 7, 22:The people described in these verses are probably saved. Thorns grow without anyone sowing the seed. But wheat does not grow if no one sows. Therefore, everything that is of God requires work; everything that is natural does not require work. To be anxious and to be greedy for riches are very natural.</P><P>Is the word of God crowded in you? Do you give the word of God sufficient room within you? A person can be outwardly very busy, very rich, and very strong, but the most important thing is whether or not the word is crowded within. The Lord's eyes do not look only at life. The Lord always looks at the bearing of fruit. The sprout grows before men. If the seed sprouts, there is life. But if it does not bear fruit, the owner will not have gained anything. The truth of the kingdom of the heavens is that God wants to gain something.</P><P>Verses 8, 23:There is only one kind of seed; the difference is in the soil. The kind of soil you are is determined by you; no one can force you. Concerning the truth of the kingdom of the heavens, it is a matter of understanding, not believing. In other words, spiritual revelation is necessary. When a person has the practical seeing, then he can bear fruit. Furthermore, the Lord does not pay attention to anything under thirty. A hundred is perfect, sixty is more than half, and thirty is not quite half. Therefore, the Lord does not pay attention to anything under thirty. The measure of death one has determines the measure of his fruitfulness.</P><P>Verse 24:"Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field." Take note that this parable is the first of the six parables of the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, the realm of this parable is somewhat broader. It must include the outline of the kingdom of the heavens. The speaking was carried out at the seashore, and the interpretation was given in the house. The parable of the sower stresses the four different kinds of soil; this parable stresses the good seed. In the first parable there is only one kind of seed, while in this parable there is only one field.</P><P>The previous parable is like a preface. It does not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...," because the work He did on earth was received only by some people. This parable refers to that which took place after He did His work. In the previous parable there is only one man; in this parable there are men sleeping. The previous parable emphasizes man's heart, whereas this parable stresses the realm of work.</P><P>As the sower in the previous parable is the Son of Man, so the sower in this parable also is the Son of Man. The "field" is the world. In chapter twenty-eight the disciples were told to go to all the nations, that is, to go into all the world. This is different from going only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The previous parable stresses only man's heart toward the Lord, while this parable stresses the preaching of the gospel to the whole world. Now there are no more boundaries. This indicates that the realm of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is as broad as the world. The church rescues people out of the world, and the kingdom of the heavens is a new sphere on the earth. The church comes out of the world, whereas the kingdom of the heavens goes into the world. Therefore, we can remove people from the church, but we cannot remove them from the kingdom of the heavens.</P>
