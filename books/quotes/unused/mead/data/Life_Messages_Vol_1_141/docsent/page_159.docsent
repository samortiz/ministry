   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LACK OF ADEQUATE REVELATION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Though many of us have heard about the matter of life in the Bible, we nonetheless do not see it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose I go home and knock at the door for my wife to let me in. When she does not open it fast enough to suit me, I knock again hard.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the door opens and she says, "Why do you have to bang on the door?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I reply, "What takes you so long to get here and open it?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then I go in and sit down to eat the dinner she has prepared for me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While I am eating, I am regretting, thinking how poor I am.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I told others to live Christ and to walk in life, yet look how I behaved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The food is sweet, but the feeling is bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I must apologize, confess to my wife, and ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am reluctant, because after so much teaching of others to walk in life, I do not have the face to admit my shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, I do make confession and then add, "I hope from now on I will never behave that way again."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you think my word never to "behave that way again" is right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To express that kind of wish shows that I am short of the revelation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It indicates that I am still trying to improve my behavior; that I am not taking Christ as life; and that I do not have the real intention to take Him as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD'S CONCERN FOR LIFE, NOT BEHAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need revelation to see that God is not concerned about how we behave.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether you hate your wife or love her, whether you are proud or humble, are not what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God wants you to take Him as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Notice that when God created Adam and placed him in a garden before a tree, He did not command Adam to worship Him, to love his wife and be a good husband, nor to behave nicely and be a good father to the children they would have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we were God, we would no doubt have given Adam many such exhortations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We would have also added some negative commands, that Adam must not be hateful, nor proud, nor kill his wife, nor smite his children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Genesis 2 would have been much longer!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's only command to Adam was regarding eating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Adam ate of the wrong tree, death would be the result; if he ate of the right tree, life the eternal, divine life would be his.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we eat becomes part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The food we eat is assimilated to become our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are composed of the chickens, cows, and other foods we have eaten!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In that garden stood the tree of life, signifying the Prince, Originator, Author of life, Jesus Christ, the very God, as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Had Adam taken of that tree, he surely would have taken God into him; God would have been in him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This very thought is in the New Testament, in the Gospel of John, when the Lord Jesus said that He would be in us and we in Him John 14:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How is He to be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must receive Him, as is signified by eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" 6:35, 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is also the One who has the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus likened our receiving Him to eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we eat and drink, something is taken into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>READING OUR CONCEPTS INTO THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we come to the Bible, however, we miss this concept that God desires to come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Genesis 2 clearly implies this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we pass over this concept and pay attention to what the Scripture says about love, or submission, or kindness, or humility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In effect, we each have our own version of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brother Nee once told us that everyone's Bible is according to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Though there is only one Bible, in the hands of Christians it becomes many.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our Bible reflects us; it says what we want it to say.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are slow, when we read the Bible, we overlook the portions that mention being quick.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are husbands, we overlook the verse about husbands loving their wives and pay attention to, "Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord" Eph 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The wives, for their part, slight the verses on submission and notice the verse that says, "Husbands, love your wives" v. 25 . Throughout the whole Bible runs the theme of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But because we do not have this concept in us, we do not notice it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead of reading something from the Bible into us, we read into the Bible what is already in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is why we find submission, love, humility, and kindness there.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That is why we see good behavior and correction in its pages.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need a revelation of life!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we shall realize that whether we love or hate, it is still from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In a way, love is worse, because then we expose ourselves; when we hate, we try to hide it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The same is true with humility and pride.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It makes no difference whether we are proud or humble.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God wants us to live Christ, not humility or pride.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I, but Christ that lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is God's desire and intention.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If I see this, I shall speak to my wife differently after I lose my temper with her for not opening the door fast enough.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather than promise not to behave that poorly again, I shall say, "Dear, I feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I did not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Pray for me, that I may have the grace, in things great and small, to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether I am humble or proud before you, there is no Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do look to Him that I may live Him in every situation."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By living Christ the tree of life gets into us.</S>
