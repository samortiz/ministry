<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Made Both Lord and Christ</H2><P>In His ascension Christ was made both Lord (Lord of lords) and Christ (Acts 2:36; Rev. 17:14a; 19:16b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Lord to Lord over and Possess<br>All Men and All Things</H2><P>Christ was made the Lord (Lord of lords) to lord over and possess all men and all things. All men in every nation belong to Christ as His possession and are under the lordship of Christ. Christ is Lord over them and possesses them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Christ to Execute God's Plan<br>and to Accomplish God's Will</H2><P>In His ascension, Christ was also made Christ to execute God's plan and to accomplish God's will. Christ is the anointed One of God to execute God's plan and to accomplish God's will.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Given to Be Head over All Things to the Church</H2><P>The ascended Christ has been given to be Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Head Up All Things<br>at the Fullness of the Times</H2><P>As the Head over all things, Christ will head up all things at the fullness of the times (Eph. 1:10). When the fullness of the times comes, Christ will head up all things, including the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. Today among the millions of people on this earth there is no head. But when the fullness of the times comes, Christ will head up all the people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. For the Church to Be the Inheritance of God according to the Counsel of God's Will</H2><P>Christ's heading up of all things is for the church to be the inheritance of God according to the counsel of God's will (Eph. 1:11). According to Ephesians 1:7 we were redeemed into Christ not only as a person but also as a sphere and as an element. We were redeemed into this sphere and into this element. According to 1:11, with Christ as the element we were made something precious, a treasure to God. This precious treasure is the church as God's inheritance. This has a great deal to do with Christ's heading up of all things. In order to head up all things, first Christ has to make us a treasure, the inheritance of God. Based on this, Christ will go on to head up all things in good order under Himself as the Head.</P>
