Before we are captured by God, our self life does not delight in serving God. But after we are captured by God, we desire to serve God. This is the most dangerous moment. In the past we were absolutely not serving God; now we intend to serve God and want to serve according to our own way. God demands that we do not merely serve Him, but that we serve Him according to the way of His delight. We make a mistake in thinking that all He demands is our service and that the way to serve can be left to our own design. We fail to realize that any service not done according to God's command and will is not acceptable to Him. Not only is our work ordained by God, but the matters concerning the process, method, and time of the work are also ordained by Him.</P><P>No matter how good a motive may be, it cannot replace God's will. No matter how much success a work produces, it is far inferior to God's delight. Many works are done "to meet the need of the circumstances," "to help the believers in their spiritual life," and "to save the souls of sinners"; they are not done for the purpose of obeying God's command. We cannot say that there is definitely no result from this kind of work, but this kind of worker and work are not suitable for God's use. We should not be concerned about the outward need of sinners and believers, but for God's need at this hour. We are here for God's need, not for the sinners' needs or the saints' needs. We are God's servants. Although God has entrusted us with the responsibility of the work, He has reserved for Himself the authority to command the workers. Although the Holy Spirit called Paul and Barnabas to work, they could not go to Asia according to their own wish. The authority to administrate the movement of the workers rests forever in the hands of the Holy Spirit. It is not that Asia did not have a need, but at that time God did not have a need for Asia. Acts shows in a wonderful way that the Holy Spirit gives us the power to work and that the Holy Spirit also commands the direction of our work. Supplying God's need at this time is the responsibility of our work.</P><P>The Bible shows us that God has not put His work into our hands. God has only servants, not managers. We are not hired by God; we are purchased by Him. He requires that we be servants. The word servant is slave according to the Greek. A slave is not a hireling; he is bought with money. A hireling will serve his master if the master's disposition is good, but if not, he can resign. This is what some people refer to as "staying if in agreement and leaving if in discord." But if we are slaves, we have to serve. Even if we do not like it, we still have to serve. We are God's slaves, not His workers, and even less, His managers. Therefore, we cannot do anything according to our own wishes. God has not committed matters to us so that we may propose ideas according to what we perceive to be good or bad. God does not work in this way. For everything, God has a definite command for us to follow. If we have not received a command from Him but work presumptuously, He cannot accept us and cannot use us; consequently, our work will certainly be burned.</P><P>The Bible shows us that God manifests His work not only in great things, He manifests it also in small matters. For this reason, we should let Him occupy not only the first place but also the last place. We should honor Him not only as the Lord of great things, but also as the Lord of small things. He is through all and fills all. If we have done something that is not according to God's will, we may still receive praise from men and still consider that we have done an excellent work, but God will have no use for us.</P><P>The Bible shows us many examples. Leviticus 10:1-2 says, "Now the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer and put fire in it, and placed incense upon it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them. And fire came from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah." The ordinances concerning offerings stipulate that every time incense is burned, one must use the fire on the altar to ignite it. Nadab and Abihu's failure was due to the fact that they used some other fire to burn the incense, rather than using the fire on the altar. The consequence was death before God.</P><P>The altar is a type of the cross. The incense is our service before God. The zeal of our service must come from the altar of the cross. Those who do not follow the ordinances concerning offering must die. What is the cross? It is the place where we put the self to death and let the Lord live. "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). The wisdom of the self, the opinion of the self, the ability, enthusiasm, expectation, and longings of the self and natural life are all dealt with in this verse. After passing through the dealing of the cross, we are worthy to come to serve before God.</P><P>We do not know how much of man's zeal is strange fire! It has not gone through the dealing of the cross and is not severed from man's desires and cleverness. Their zeal is completely according to the desires of the flesh, and man supposes that if he does this or that and the work prospers, then God must be pleased. The zeal may indeed be a form of zeal, but it does not originate from God. The fire may be genuine fire, yet it is not the fire on the altar. Rather, it is strange fire. Whatever does not come from the altar of crucifixion and from self-forsaking is altogether strange fire. Strange fire is nothing but the fire of the self, the fire that issues from the soulish life. This is the fire of the fleshly and natural life. It is nothing other than the natural life interfering with God's affairs. Although the matter is from God, the natural life proposes how it should be done. The self insists on its proposal, method, and wisdom in God's affairs. Even though the strange fire is fire, God will not accept the incense of our service. On the contrary, we will die before Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
