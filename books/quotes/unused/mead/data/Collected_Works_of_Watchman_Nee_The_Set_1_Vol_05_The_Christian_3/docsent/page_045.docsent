   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have said much about the door, but according to this book, the door seems to signify more than the above.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider a little more carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we study this letter carefully, we will see the importance of the prophetic nature of this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the promises to the overcomers are prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The preservation from the trials and the Jews falling prostrate refer to the rapture and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The initial meaning of the key in verse 7 is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, it is natural that verse 8 should also be prophetic in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read carefully, we will find out that this indeed is the case.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not overturning what we have just said.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are here only considering the deeper significance of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen the meaning of the door from other books.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we want to consider the deeper significance of the door from this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we take the principle of interpreting the Scripture with the Scripture, and especially if we take the attitude of interpreting this book with this book, we will see that the opening of the door here must be related to the door in 4:1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here" 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the opening of the door in this book signifies nothing other than the rapture into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two doors here vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>7-8 bring both the living as well as the dead believers fully into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First the Lord opens the door of Hades so that the dead believers may be able to return to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the Lord opens the door of heaven so that the living and the dead believers may ascend from earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although many times the reward of faithful work is more opportunities for working for the Lord, the door here is not given to us at the time we work, but is rewarded to us after we work and after the work is fully completed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This refers to nothing other than the entry into the heavenly door of special glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The saints in Philadelphia manifested a little power for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now the Lord Jesus is manifesting a great power for them in opening up the door of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one can shut this door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who can shut the door of heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ has opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who can now shut it?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that chapter twelve of this book records that when the man-child is about to be raptured to heaven, the old serpent, the red dragon Satan, will try to devour him in wrath and stop him from ascending to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Satan's plan will completely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ has opened the door for them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Satan tries to shut this door, he will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Though the world restricts us, opposes us, resists us, and persecutes us, it cannot cut off our way to heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we come to a most crucial point, which is the biblical qualification or the condition for one to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Will the whole body of the believers be raptured, or will only a part be raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can receive an accurate answer from this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have mentioned more than once that the last four churches in chapters two and three are churches that will remain simultaneously until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These four churches are but types of the four different conditions the churches will be in before the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have also mentioned repeatedly that there are two ways to look at the seven churches in these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One way is to consider these seven churches as actual churches of the day to which the apostle John was commissioned by the Lord to send these letters 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The other way is to consider them as types of the condition of the church throughout the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must differentiate between the churches themselves and the churches of the ages they typify.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, in itself, the church in Thyatira was composed of the actual believers living in Thyatira at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As such, those in it were saved ones and had life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the Roman Catholic Church that it typifies is not necessarily the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We know that there are many perishing ones in the Roman Catholic Church!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The same is true of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many consider the members in Laodicea as those who are not saved, but this is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Laodicea was not a fictitious church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John saw altogether seven heavenly lampstands; Laodicea was one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord clearly recognized Laodicea as a church, a called-out congregation of saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The star of the messenger of Laodicea was in the Lord's hand in the same way the other messengers were.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord did not preach the gospel to them for they were all saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord commanded them also to hear what the Holy Spirit was saying to the churches because they were a real church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This refers to the actual condition of Laodicea in the apostolic age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the condition of the churches in the age typified by Laodicea is different.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the present-day Laodicean churches, there are mixed multitudes who are not saved!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The differentiation between the seven churches themselves and that which they typify is crucial to the understanding of these seven letters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to what we have said, the believers in these seven churches were all saved and regenerated, and they all had life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the strange thing is that the Lord's promise of rapturing the saints from the tribulation upon earth was given to Philadelphia only.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although typologically speaking, there are saved believers in Thyatira, Sardis, and Laodicea, just as there are those in Philadelphia, the former did not receive this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By this point, we realize that unless a believer reaches the standard of Philadelphia, he will not be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first rapture which delivers one from the tribulations upon the earth is not a common one, but a special one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A common believer cannot participate in this rapture; only a special group who have received grace can enjoy this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of course, all the believers will be raptured, but the Bible tells us that their times of rapture are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Unless believers possess the nature and qualifications of the Philadelphian believers, they will not be taken away at the first special rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These are the Philadelphians, the ones with the brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is their mutual attitude as members in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When Peter mentioned many necessary virtues for a believer in his second Epistle, he added to everything "Philadelphia" brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Following that, he told us that this will supply one with a rich entrance into the Lord's kingdom 2 Pet 1:5-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, from its name, we can see that these have already entered the perfection in Christ in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is what the Lord requires of His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have seen the works of the Philadelphians.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord does not freely give to them this great promise of the rapture without condition.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord's promise is based on their former faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"Behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The condition for rapture is to manifest spiritual power for the Lord, to keep His word, and to exalt His name.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we walk according to our own will every day and do not keep the Lord's word, we are dreaming if we hope to have the right of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is important to exalt the Lord's name and to draw close to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need a deeper death to ourselves so that we can set aside our own confused thoughts and keep the Lord's word which opposes our natural preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should have a deeper death toward the world so that we can forsake everything and can have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord cannot take us to a heaven to which we have no pleasure in going.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He cannot drag us to a presence in which we have no joy in remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>These things must first have their basis on earth before they will have their consummation in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is vain for us to talk about the Lord Jesus' coming every day.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What is needed is the adequate preparation.</S>
