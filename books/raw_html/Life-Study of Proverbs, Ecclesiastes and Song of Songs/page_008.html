<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Trusting in God</H2><P>To revere God is also to trust in Him. Proverbs 3:5-8 charges us to trust in Jehovah with all our heart and not to rely on our own understanding. In all our ways we should acknowledge Him, and He will make our paths straight. We should not be wise in our own eyes; we should fear Jehovah and depart from evil. This will be healing to our body and refreshment to our bones.</P><P>He who gives heed to the word will find good, and blessed is he who trusts in Jehovah (16:20). In my frequent travels by airplane, many times Satan has threatened me within by saying that my plane would crash. At those times I spoke to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I am not in a plane; I am in You. You are my plane." This is to trust in the Lord.</P><P>According to 3:26 Jehovah will be our confidence, and He will keep our foot from being caught. Every word of God is tried; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. We should not add to His words, lest He reprove us and we be found a liar (30:5-6). We must not change His word by adding something to it according to our point of view. This is dangerous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Honoring God</H2><P>To revere God means that we also honor God. Proverbs 3:9-10 says that we must honor Jehovah with our substance and with the firstfruits of all our produce. Then our barns will be filled with plenty, and our vats will burst open with new wine. If we make more money to lay up treasure for our future, that is pitiful. At least one tenth, the firstfruit, of our produce must be given to God. We should always be very generous in giving of the things which God has given us. This honors God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. NEEDING WISDOM</H2><P>The second principle, the second nugget, is needing wisdom. Notice that I do not say seeking wisdom but needing wisdom. We are always in need of the wisdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The One Who Finds Wisdom Being Blessed</H2><P>Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her income is better than gold. She is more precious than corals, and nothing we desire compares with her. Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her, and happy are those who hold her fast (3:13-18; 8:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Letting Wisdom Depart from Our Sight</H2><P>We should not let wisdom depart from our sight, but we should keep sound wisdom and discretion. They will be life for our soul and a graceful ornament for our neck (3:21-22). The real beauty is wisdom and discretion.</P>
