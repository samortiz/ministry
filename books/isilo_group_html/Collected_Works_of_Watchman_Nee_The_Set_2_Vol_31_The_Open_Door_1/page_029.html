I received your letter awhile ago and found that you were already in Hankow. We pray for you often. My heart truly misses you and hopes to know your most recent situation. How is the work? May the Lord use you much in these hours when He is about to come. Glory to His holy name. I really hope that the Lord will give us an opportunity to see each other again and talk about the Lord's grace. Praise the Lord, He sent Sister Kao Chui-lan to work with us last month. Praise the Lord's grace! There are many sisters who have just believed in the Lord here in our work. There are also more than one hundred people here every week, most of whom do not know the Lord. Please pray for them. Some brothers are preparing to preach the gospel to unbelievers for a week. May the Lord accomplish His work in the hearts of men. Will The Christian still be published? Kao Chui-lan wants to subscribe to it. Could you take the time to put in her subscription? I am really happy that you gave me Isaiah 41:10 when we parted. It is a comfort and a reminder to me to this day. Thank the Lord, no matter what dangers we encounter, we can find rest and protection in His almighty covering (Psa. 23:3)! May the Lord bless the work ahead of you, amen.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Rong Fu-tien<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from K. H. Weigh, K'un-ming</h2><p>To Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received both the second and third issues of The Open Door. Thank you. We are looking for a meeting place because our old landlord is remodeling the building for his own use. Since the beginning of the war, the cost of housing has been exorbitant and rents have soared to three and four times their former rate. Thank the Lord for His grace in preparing two appropriate homes for Brother Huang and myself. (My house is well-lighted and airy and has seven rooms.) There has been a great increase in the numbers in the meetings over the past few weeks. Thank the Lord because He was not only lifted up on the cross but also lifted up by God to the highest heaven at the right hand of the throne of God, and He has drawn a group of people to Himself. This Lord's Day seventy or eighty came to hear the Word. (Of course, our numbers mean nothing. If the Lord wants to give us people, we thank Him. There will always be some who go back and are not willing to walk with us, but we do not find this strange because when the Lord was on the earth, He had revival meetings in which the numbers got smaller and smaller, like the one spoken of in John 6:66. After the three or more years of the Lord's work, there were only one hundred twenty with Him at His death, resurrection, and ascension, but the number of those who received grace by listening to His preaching exceeded several thousand. The faithful followers of the Lord are as few as the morning stars! Hence, we find no exception today.) The number at the table has increased from around fifteen to twenty-three. It is all the Lord's grace! The Lord Himself has done the work! There are many brothers and sisters who were saved by the Lord from Gentile households. Among them is a sister who is very much opposed by her family for believing in the Lord, but she overcomes by relying on the Lord, and she has a good testimony at home. There is also a couple who used to fully serve demons, the wife often being attacked by evil spirits. After believing in the Lord, she found victory through trusting in the Lord. She was very sickly, but the Lord has healed her. She is stronger every day. We really thank and praise the Lord! The church here will have a baptism meeting in the near future. There are many brothers and sisters who want to obey the Lord and testify of their death, burial, and resurrection together with the Lord. We are now preparing the baptistry and need about X dollars.</p><p>We heard that you and the others will not be able to come to K'un-ming until April. However, the brothers and sisters and I hope that you can come earlier. If you and Sisters Wang and Chang cannot come together, we would ask one or two to come earlier because the work among the sisters really needs you. There is much work among the sisters that I cannot do. Therefore, I ask you three to pray before the Lord and see what His will is. If His will is for you to come, I believe He will send His angels to protect you in all your travels (Psa. 91:11). The fact that Brother Chang Jing-yuan and two other sisters could arrive peacefully is the proof of the Lord's grace to us. Mrs. Yin Ren-hsian came here from Ch'ang-sha two or three weeks ago and often comes to the meetings. K'un-ming is now full of people from other provinces who have come to escape the war. There are many opportunities for the work here. Unfortunately, the harvest is great and the workers are few. May the Lord send many workers to come gather His harvest. Amen! Peace in the Lord! Please greet Brother Chang Yu-zhi and Sisters Chang and Wang.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Kwang-hsi<br />January 16</p><p>(Brother Weigh has already moved to 15 Shih-Ma Lane, Jin-Ma Street, Upper Floor Apartment, K'un-ming, Yunnan Province. Letters can be sent in care of Mr. Huang Tsung, Customs Office, K'un-ming, Yunnan.)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
