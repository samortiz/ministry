   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WHEEL WITHIN A WHEEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezekiel 1:16 says that the wheel looks like a wheel within a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we speak of a wheel, we say that the circumference is the rim, that the center is the hub, and between these two are the spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, you have the rim, the hub, and the spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in this chapter there is no hub and there are no spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, there is a wheel within a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In James 5:17 we are told that when Elijah prayed, he prayed with prayer Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>; there was a prayer within his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the wheel within a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means if the church is proper and the church is moving, that within the church's moving there will be the move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In your move is the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While you are moving, the Lord is moving in your moving.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The inner wheel is the source of the power for moving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The inner wheel is the motor which makes the wheel move.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If your move is genuine, it must be that within your move is the move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every wheel has a hub which turns the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the hub stops, the wheel stops.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The hub is the little wheel within the rim of the big wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The big wheel turns because the little wheel is being turned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church life, the Lord Jesus is the hub and we are the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus is the wheel within the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the churches are not moving with the Lord, they have no way to go on because there is no wheel within the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when the churches are moving with the Lord Jesus, He becomes the wheel within the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nothing can frustrate or stop that move.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE WHEEL FOLLOWING THE LIVING CREATURES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is meaningful to see that the living creatures do not follow the wheel, but that the wheel follows the living creatures 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is in contrast to Christianity's concept which tells people to wait until the Lord moves and then they can move.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have been burdened by the Lord to tell His children that there is no need for them to wait for the Lord to move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord has been waiting on you for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you ready?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you will go on, the Lord will follow you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The creatures do not follow the wheels, but the wheels follow the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the creatures move, the wheels move.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the creatures stop, the wheels stop.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the creatures are lifted up, the wheels are lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not exercise, there will be no wheel, but if we say, "Hallelujah, let us go!" the wheels will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must have the confidence, the assurance, and the faith to go on boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we go on boldly, the wheels will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not wait for the Lord to move.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord has been waiting for us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we will go on, the Lord will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us go and take the land!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us go and take the country!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us go and take the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE SPIRIT BEING IN THE WHEEL</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here is another wonderful point.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The wheels follow the creatures and the creatures follow the Spirit, but the Spirit is in the wheels 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is hard to tell who follows whom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah, we are following Him and He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day when we meet Him we will say, "Lord we followed You," but the Lord will say, "No, I followed you."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who can tell who followed whom?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have the wheel with the coordination, it is really difficult to say who followed whom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are one with the Lord, and the Lord is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord follows us, and we follow the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the Lord's move today on the earth; this is the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Remember, we must have the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum; we must be the living creatures with the four faces, with the eagle's wings, with the calf's hoofs, with the hands of a man, having the fire burning as the coals and as the torches, and we must be coordinated as one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then, we will have a high and dreadful wheel in our local church.</S>
