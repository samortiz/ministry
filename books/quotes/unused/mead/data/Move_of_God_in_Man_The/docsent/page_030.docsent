   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God participated in that death, so God moved in that death in man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The crucifixion was not only Christ's work but also God's move in man, so it is God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God was merely God in eternity.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of the world affairs are not only the history of man but also the history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It depends on the vision you have.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you have only physical sight, you see the world situation, the human history.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have the spiritual sight, the spiritual view, you can see someone working behind the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we look at human history with the world situation, we must have another view, the biblical view with the spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The crucifixion of Christ was a part of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to human history, Jesus, a Jew and a Nazarene, was nailed on the cross by the Roman soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But behind this visible scene there was an invisible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who was there on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God was there to bear the sin and sins of man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God was there to die for fallen mankind.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Also, on the cross the shell of His humanity was broken, and God released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God was working in the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No secular historian on earth can touch these things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They do not have this view.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even many Christians do not have a view to see that God accomplished seven items on the negative side plus one item on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the positive aspect of the cross, God released Himself as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The cross was God's move and has become God's history.</S>
