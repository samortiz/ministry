<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THOUGHTS AND SUBMISSION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Morning, July 6, 1948<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 10:4-5</h1><p>Today we want to continue our discussion with 2 Corinthians 10:4-5. Every high thing is translated "edifices" by Henry Alford. It means tall buildings. It is used to describe structures, edifices, erected in one's heart. The word thought is noema in the original language. It is used six times in the New Testament: once in Philippians and five times in 2 Corinthians. In 2 Corinthians 2:11 it is translated as schemes, and in 3:14, 4:4, 10:5, and 11:3 it is rendered thoughts. It carries more of an idea of volition than of mental activity, and it can alternatively be translated as "purpose in the heart."</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CAPTIVE THE THOUGHTS</h2><p>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 tells us that the high things in man are strongholds; they are the things that hinder a man from knowing God. For example, an unbeliever has many excuses; these are his strongholds. Every time he is asked to believe in the Lord, he turns to these excuses to protect himself. He says that he is busy or that he has prior engagements. These are reasons which a man uses to fence himself in, reasons by which he rejects God. They are actually the work of Satan. We should note, however, that these verses refer to believers who have been taken captive in their thoughts. All the high things that hinder a man from knowing God must be overthrown before his thoughts can be taken captive. To take captive means to capture. God overthrows our strongholds for the purpose of capturing our thoughts. This is the only way that we can come to the obedience of Christ. By nature, man's thoughts are free; they operate according to their own will. If they are left to themselves, they will never come to the obedience of Christ. Our thoughts must be made a slave before they can serve the Lord. Our thoughts represent our existence as an independent person. Our mind first judges certain things to be good, thinks about them, and finally makes decisions based upon them. Our proposals and decisions represent our very being. In order to maintain our personal freedom, we have to make decisions. In order to preserve ourselves and justify our decisions and ideas as being superior, we surround ourselves with many reasons. We have to maintain that our way is right, and we provide reasons to justify why we forbid anyone to touch our decisions. We fortify ourselves with all kinds of reasons, like village folks who protect their hamlets with barracks and fortifications. This is what happens when a man's thoughts are surrounded by strongholds.</p><p>Yesterday I said that a servant of God must not reason. Everyone who wants to serve the Lord must have his eyes opened to Romans 9; he must experience this chapter. It is not enough to stop one's speaking or reasonings; his thoughts must be taken captive. The mouth has to be stopped, and reasons have to go away. More than this, the thoughts have to be taken captive and stripped of all ideas and proposals. The stopping of one's mouth is merely a superficial dealing. Inwardly one has to deal with reasons and thoughts. A man must have reasons overthrown and thoughts captured before he can be brought to the obedience of Christ. It is easy to spot those who can submit to authority. It is not hard to identify those who have touched authority. Those who have touched authority and who practice genuine submission are bridled in their tongues; they do not have many reasons. Neither do they propose many things. Those who have not touched authority always try to fortify their own thoughts with reasons and proposals. A day will come when a man's thoughts are taken captive; they will be "kidnapped." That will be the day when he is brought to the obedience of Christ.</p><p>Many people like to be God's counselors. They want God to listen to them and take their advice. They think they can draft God's blueprints. Wherever the ones whose thoughts are not captured go, they want to make improvements instead of live out submission. Their favorite expression is, "To me, this is wrong, and that is wrong. You have to do this and that." Their thoughts and reasonings are never held in check, and they can never be submissive. We have to be dealt with to the point that our thoughts are captured. Our proposals must be dealt with before we can see authority. If we are full of self-ideas and self-proposals, we do not know authority. There are two omniscient beings in this universe&mdash;God and the self. We want to be men's counselor, and we also want to be God's counselor. We want to change everything around wherever we go. It seems as if we know everything. This clearly shows that our thoughts are not captured; we still do not know authority. Obeying Christ means to be under authority, to stop all proposals, and to lose all interest in making proposals. We should become persons without any conception; our only desire should be to obey. Those who have touched God's authority have no desire to make proposals. They only care to obey.</p>
