   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAISE FOR THE KING AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 145 tells how the saints praise God for His reigning in Christ and His Kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 indicates that God is the King in Christ: "I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To extol is higher and deeper than to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the Psalmist extols Christ as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 10 to 13 reveal that God's Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom with glory and majesty: "All thy works all things on this earth shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power power now comes from the city to the kingdom ; to make known to the sons of men all peoples, races, and nations in the entire earth his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now you can see how the praises of the Psalmists have turned to the reigning Christ and His Kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In all the previous Psalms the praises have been mostly occupied with Christ, the house, and then the city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now the praise concerns the reigning Christ and His glorious Kingdom over the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations" v. 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now verse 21: "My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What can we do now but use our mouth to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not tell me that there is no need to shout, that you need only praise the Lord from within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Psalmist says here, "My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must use your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"And let all flesh the human race, all people bless his holy name for ever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My mouth shall speak His glory, and all flesh shall bless His holy name through all eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must never forget these Psalms concerning Christ, concerning the house and the city, concerning the life of unity, and now concerning the Kingdom: Psalms 110, 118</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ Psalms 122, 126, 132</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>the house and the city Psalms 133, 134</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the life of unity Psalms 137 to 145</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>the Kingdom</S>
