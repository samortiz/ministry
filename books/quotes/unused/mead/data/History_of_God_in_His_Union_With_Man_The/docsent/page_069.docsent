   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob stayed with Laban and worked for Laban for twenty years, and within this time Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times v. 41 . The first fourteen years of his labor were his service to Laban so that he could gain Leah and Rachel as his wives.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Laban was not an easygoing person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob with his four wives did not say goodbye to him when they left.</S>
