FOR THE CHURCHES TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Since 1961, when I went to America to start the work there, I have returned to Taiwan almost every year, but the situation of the church here is not satisfactory. However, this time when I saw the saints sharing in the conference and heard their responses to the messages, I was surprised. Even the young saints can speak concerning the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit. It seems as though we are children in a scholarly family who can speak the truth. This shows that there is progress in the church in Taipei. The response of the saints has improved, and they are able to express what they receive. The spirits of the brothers and sisters are strong in the meetings. This atmosphere can conquer and subdue people. It is not possible to pretend to have such a spirit. All the brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan have improved.</p>
<p>In recent years every aspect of society in Taiwan, including education, the economy, and transportation, has made tremendous progress. This has created a golden opportunity for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery; the church is doing well, and there are many useful saints. Some people may say that since the economy in Taiwan is booming and the standard of living has improved, people may not want the Lord. It was not like this thirty-five years ago when we arrived from mainland China, and everything was unsettled. It was easy then for people to receive the gospel. However, there are many factors in the environment in Taiwan today that are better for the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago I fellowshipped with the brothers and sisters concerning service. I told them that we need to be faithful, and as an example I used my experience of realizing the need in the Lord&rsquo;s work during my trip from the north to the south of Taiwan. More than thirty years have passed, and that word has been fulfilled. The time of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan is ripe. It will be a pity if we do not seize this opportunity, because we will lose a great chance. The ten years ahead of us will be a crucial time.</p>
<p>After the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began in Taiwan in 1949, our numbers increased one hundredfold during the next six or seven years. We began with less than five hundred saints, but by 1956 or 1957 we increased to fifty thousand. When we began the meetings in 1949, the brothers and sisters did not understand much concerning the truth, but today many saints are acquainted with the truth.</p>
<p>Some brothers told me that there are two thousand young working saints in the church in Taipei alone. While I was very happy when I heard this, I felt that we should have several thousand more; we should at least have double this number. Nevertheless, we must consider before the Lord how we can use these two thousand young working saints. Should they be here only enjoying the Lord, like Peter, James, and John, who wanted to set up three tents on the mountain because they thought it was good for them to be there (cf. Matt. 17:1-8)? We should not forget that there are demon-possessed people at the foot of the mountain (vv. 9, 14-21). It may be good for us to be here; we are comfortable sitting in meetings with air conditioning, but are we willing to go &ldquo;down from the mountain&rdquo; to meet the needs of people in the world?</p>
<p>All the churches in Taiwan should move together as one corporate entity. Then the island of Taiwan will receive a great blessing. For the past thirty years, the Lord has been blessing Taiwan for Himself. Many people abroad have said that in thirty short years Taiwan has been converted from an agricultural society to a modern industrial society. If we are faithful, God will multiply His blessing upon this place.</p>
<p>When Western missionaries came to China to preach the gospel, the Chinese were not widely educated, and they could not understand the truth. They could not understand what was justification or what was regeneration; this forced the Western missionaries to establish schools and bring in Western education. But today everyone in Taiwan understands the truth. If we go out to preach the gospel and say, &ldquo;You need to be justified, and after you are justified, you need to receive the Spirit,&rdquo; they will understand us. The Lord has given Taiwan the top blessing of having a superior education system that has produced many people with graduate degrees. In the area of transportation, we can now go from Kaohsiung to Taipei in four or five hours. People live and work in a safe environment and in a stable society. Furthermore, the government has granted the people many freedoms. This is a huge benefit to our preaching the gospel. It is time for us to &ldquo;come down from the mountain&rdquo; because the people in the world need our care.</p>
<p>If the church in Taipei can produce five hundred full-timers, within three years at least thirty thousand people can be brought into the church. From 1949 I led the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel. Even though I was abroad for three or four months a year, in just six or seven years our numbers increased from five hundred to fifty thousand. The five hundred saints were both young and elderly. The church in Taipei now has more than two thousand young people who are up to the standard in every aspect. Why should we not gain thirty thousand people if we preach the gospel for three years? You may say that we need full-timers, and that we need to train them. If you produce five hundred full-timers, I will come and train them.</p>
<p>May we consider the way two thousand years of church history has ended in today&rsquo;s situation and then look at what the Lord is doing among us, that is, at how much light He has given us, and His blessing of us and our environment. The world today seems to be smaller in size than a village was in the old days. In those days, transportation was inconvenient, and the modes of communication were not well-developed. We did not even have the telephone. Today we can make international phone calls to any place around the world. This is a tremendous opportunity. How can we not seize it? We have a history of more than thirty years here in Taipei during which the Lord has blessed us with a solid foundation, brothers and sisters in every level of society, and an environment in which it is easy to preach the gospel. We must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
