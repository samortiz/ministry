   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Walk under the Shadow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Death of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To bear the cross in a fine way is to "live within the Cross's shadow."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second stanza of Hymn #631 expresses this experience:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I'd have Christ formed within me,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I must breathe my final breath,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Live within the Cross's shadow,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Put my soul-life e'er to death</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If no death, no life,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If no death, no life;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Life from death alone arises;</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If no death, no life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>EXPERIENCING THE CROSS OF CHRIST BY CONTACTING THE LORD AND BEING FILLED WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In God's New Testament economy, Christ has accomplished incarnation to become Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also accomplished crucifixion to terminate us and resurrection to germinate us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we should experience Him as Immanuel through the life-giving Spirit by putting everything concerning us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is to experience the cross in a fine way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having seen this vision of the experience of the cross, we can realize that the church life among us is still very short.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one is able to do this in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason that we must contact the Lord and have fellowship with Him, being revived every morning in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must touch the Lord and be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He Himself as Immanuel and as the life-giving Spirit will be experienced by us as the reality of the cross and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit will become our experience of the cross and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, in our experience, there is no distance between the cross and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cross goes with the Spirit, and the Spirit carries the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Receiving the Spirit consummates in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to experience this, however, we must be persons who contact the Lord all the time in resurrection.</S>
