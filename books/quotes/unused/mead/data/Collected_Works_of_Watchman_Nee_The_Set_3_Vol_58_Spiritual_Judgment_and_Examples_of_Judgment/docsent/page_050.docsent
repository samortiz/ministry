   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 30 Date:August 3, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER Y. U.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before I was saved in 1933, I was addicted to novels and drama.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later I borrowed some spiritual books from a sister and attended prayer meetings regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am an optimistic person and I like to laugh and joke.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After my mother passed away, I felt lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every afternoon at three o'clock I would shut my doors and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the end of 1940 I heard Brother Nee speak on the cross, and I felt as if he were speaking to me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, because of the pressure of my teaching job, I developed a heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Prior to that I walked quickly and spoke fast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After I became ill, I could no longer move around freely.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I often thought that I would die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While it seemed as if I was dying outwardly, I was also dying inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A sister told me that this was a thought from Satan and that I had to reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I wondered how others could live the Christian life so joyfully while I lived in such pain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An elderly sister came and visited me and told me that the day of my salvation had come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I had a strange experience that day as I was washing my clothes in my room.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A voice came and said, "I, Jehovah, am your help."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some sisters also prayed for me, and I was strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From that time forward my joy came back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not working, yet God has supplied me richly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I live in a sisters' house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do all the washing, cooking, heating, and other chores; they do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not ask God to change the environment, but I ask Him to change me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spiritually, I feel that I am poor and have many manifested weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I see the weaknesses in others, and I see the weaknesses in myself all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have also seen that the Lord has given me one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I deny this, I offend the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Being in Harmony with the Environment</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With respect to our past experiences, the Lord wants to bring every one of us into harmony with our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone who is at odds with the Lord is at odds with his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot choose our own experiences, and we cannot escape our own environment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have heard three or four brothers and sisters who have testified to this fact, and we should have received some light from their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>None of us can choose our own pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's goal is to bring us into harmony with our surrounding environment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not argue with our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we should submit to the Lord who arranges these encounters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit is the One who makes all the arrangements inside of us and around us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as we accept the Lord who has arranged these inward and outward circumstances, our many turmoils will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we advance and progress along the way, the more we will be one with our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, when we face sickness in our environment, we can ask for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When our emotions suffer a blow, we can ask for peace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We always expect others to treat us well, but often just the opposite occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that most of the time we lose our peace, joy, and blessing this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we can accept and approve of all of the environment and experience that the Lord has measured to us, peace, joy, and blessing will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord always brings us into harmony with the environment around us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Accepting God's Arrangements</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is easy to talk about the discipline of the Holy Spirit but very hard to see it in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible says that even our hairs have been numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is easy to say this, but how much do we really know of this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything is under the Lord's arranging hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the beginning of our Christian life, we are wild and raw.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not easy for us to accept God's arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we grow, we become more in tune with God's arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people ask for things that are apart from the Lord's arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the Lord will not change and we cannot accept His arrangements and change ourselves, the only thing that will happen is that our days of struggling will be prolonged.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will become days of loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord does not have to change His ways, but we have to accept His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is best to say, "Lord, I am willing to accept everything that You do."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Spiritual progress has nothing to do with outward changes, but with inward acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If God's hand lets go of us, we are finished; we have nowhere to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everything falls into place if we accept God's arrangements in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we cannot accept them, we have to look to God for mercy to enable us to accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We often think that we are withstanding Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Actually, we are withstanding God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The sooner we come into harmony with our environment, the better it is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more we inwardly complain, the more the Lord's hand will be heavy upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should be pliable, harmonious, and even transcendent in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are dissatisfied with all that the Lord has done, there will be few alternatives for us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to believe that the Lord is arranging everything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every time a strand of our hair turns white, we should praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God's arrangements are so minute that even a strand of hair is in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Can something greater than a strand of hair not be part of God's ordering?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a man presumes that he can reject his outward circumstances, he is rejecting God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The cross is heavy only if it is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if we are crucified on the cross, it will not be heavy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the contrary, our own weight and burden will be upon the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more we accept and give up fighting, the less problems we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the subject of spiritual poverty, we should realize that our way depends not on rich feelings or feelings of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should only have the feeling of death in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Yet we bring life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the Lord brings us to the place of death, neither poverty or riches are our business any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we learn to accept poverty, the Lord will be rich in others.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The sense of weakness and weakness itself are two different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord will bring us to the point of weakness, and He will also bring us to a sense of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Many brothers who are beginners in His service feel as if they can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They are strong because they have not passed through the experience of weakness; they have not gone through many years of stripping.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord only gives us one feeling the feeling of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We feel that power is not with us but with others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In reality, we may be rich or we may be poor, but the Lord always puts a sense of weakness in us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the only way He can use us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is not a matter of the Lord's power becoming our power.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We remain weak all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord's strength only rests on our weakness; it does not remove our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>None of us should crave a sense of power.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should not feel or sense this at all.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our feeling should always be one of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should leave it to others to feel our power and our riches.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must never advance from a feeling of poverty to a feeling of abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Instead, we should advance from a feeling of poverty to true poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>On our side, we should only feel weak.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Power and riches are the Lord's business.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Moses' face shone, but he did not know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I am afraid many young people look into the mirror every day to see if their faces are shining.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we really knew that our faces were shining, probably we would soon lose the light.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is better that we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is the way.</S>
