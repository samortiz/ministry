We all know that the Old Testament is a book of types, and the greatest, all-inclusive type is the history of the people of Israel. In Christianity today, many teachers and Christians apply the things which happened in the beginning of the history of the people of Israel to their Christian experiences. I believe we all know this. We know how to apply the Passover to our experience of redemption, and we know how to apply the crossing of the Red Sea to our experience of baptism. We know how to apply the enjoyment of the daily manna and even the water from the cleft rock to our experiences, for this is taking Christ as our daily supply and as our living water. We even know how to apply the temple built by King Solomon to our experience.<p>But very few Christians know how to apply the last part of the history of the people of Israel. What does the captivity mean to us? How can we apply the captivity to our experiences? And what does the recovery, the return from captivity, mean? And how can we apply their recovery to our experiences? Most Christians know how to apply the beginning, but they simply neglect to apply the ending.<p>What stage are we in according to the spiritual situation of today&#8217;s Christians? There is no doubt that we are in the stage of captivity. Captivity means that the people of God have been scattered; it means that there is no more unity. God&#8217;s people have been carried away from the proper ground of unity to a wrong ground. First they were in Jerusalem, gathered and centralized, but later they were scattered and carried away to many places. This is the captivity. Let us apply this to today&#8217;s situation. Are Christians today gathered or are they scattered? In a sense, they are more scattered than the people of Israel were. They are very divided and very scattered. This means Christianity is in captivity. We do need to return, and we need to be recovered. We need not only revival, but also recovery.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF RECOVERY</h2><p>What do we mean when we say that we need to be recovered? Do we mean that our health needs to be recovered, or that our job needs to be recovered? No, to be recovered means to be brought back to Jerusalem. It means to come back from Babylon to Jerusalem. This is the right meaning of recovery. Negatively, to be recovered means to be brought out of Babylon, and positively, it means to be brought up to Jerusalem. Have you been recovered out of Babylon, and have you been recovered back to Jerusalem? Perhaps some would ask, &#8220;What is today&#8217;s Babylon and what is today&#8217;s Jerusalem? How do we apply Babylon and Jerusalem to our experience?&#8221; We know that Jerusalem was the center in the land of Canaan for the people of Israel to be gathered. Jerusalem was the ground of unity.<p>We are told by the Scriptures that some of the people of Israel were taken captive to Syria and some to Egypt, but the majority of them were taken captive to Babylon. Babylon was the main place of their captivity. So, in type the meaning of Jerusalem is the ground of unity. This is the ground for the gathering of the Lord&#8217;s people. And the meaning of Babylon is division, scattering, and captivity. To be recovered out of Babylon is to be recovered out of division and to be recovered to Jerusalem means to be recovered back to the original ground of unity.<h2 class=head1>THE PLACE GOD CHOOSES</h2><p>When the people of God were brought into the good land, according to Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16, the Lord told them many times that when they entered into the land of Canaan, they had no right to choose a worship center. God told them again and again that He would choose the place, the unique place, the only place where He would set His name and build His habitation. Eventually, that place was Jerusalem. Therefore, Jerusalem became the center for God&#8217;s people to worship Him, and this unique center kept the unity of the people of God. Without such a center, after they entered the good land, the people would have been divided.<p>For instance, the tribe of Dan lived in the north, quite a distance from Jerusalem. Suppose they said that they lived too far away, and transportation to Jerusalem was not convenient for them. After all, God is not limited by geography. If God could be in Jerusalem, why could He not also be in Dan? If the tribe of Dan were to speak in this way, immediately the people of God would be divided. Then another tribe would say that if Dan could set up a second center, they could set up a third one. Then a third center would be established. Others then would follow and set up a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth until there would be endless division!<p>God is wise. He foresaw this problem so He repeated His commandment again and again. The people of Israel had no right to choose their own place to worship. This right was in God&#8217;s hands. He was the only One who had the choice. Israel had no choice; they were to take God&#8217;s choice, the divine choice. The choice of God should be the choice for us. God&#8217;s choice became the center of the gathering of His people, and this is the unique ground of unity.<h2 class=head1>UNITY OF DIVISION</h2><p>After a time, the people of Israel were taken captive and scattered into at least three divisions. After seventy years, some of the people of Israel in Babylon were revived and rose up. But was that enough? No! They had revival, but they still did not have the genuine unity, because the unity in Babylon is still the unity of division. Even though they were united there, they were united in a way of a division. They did rise up, and they did love one another, but they loved one another in a division. This may be a revival, but this could never be a recovery.<p>Why did the people of Israel have to go back to Jerusalem? Could they not worship God in Babylon? Yes, they could worship God in Babylon, and they could worship God in Syria and Egypt. They could worship God in those places, but His house was not in those places. If they were going to worship God in His house, they had to go back to Jerusalem. God is not narrow; He can be worshipped anywhere. But to worship God in this way can never satisfy Him. They could worship God, but they would always have the sense that they were in captivity. They could worship God, but with a sense that they were not satisfied. This is because they would not be worshipping God in His house.<p>How can we apply this to us today? Unless we return to the ground of unity, we can never be satisfied, regardless of how spiritual we are. It is true that God is not narrow. Wherever we are, He is with us. But that kind of worship can never satisfy God, and it cannot satisfy us. This is because we are short of God&#8217;s desire. God&#8217;s desire is to have a house, a habitation, on this earth.<h2 class=head1>STIRRED UP, RISE UP, GO UP</h2><p>In Ezra 1 there are many &#8220;ups.&#8221; Here in this chapter there are at least five &#8220;ups.&#8221; First, God stirred up their spirit (Ezra 1:1, 5). Our spirit needs to be stirred up. We should not be emotional, thoughtful, or determined, but we must be stirred up in our spirit. This is the first &#8220;up.&#8221; Then we must rise up (Ezra 1:5). After being stirred up in the spirit, we must rise up. This is the second &#8220;up.&#8221; Then after rising up, we must go up (Ezra 1:3, 5). Everyone who is being recovered is going up, not down. When we are being recovered, we simply have the feeling that we are up! To go back to the house means to go up.<h2 class=head1>BRING UP, BUILD UP</h2><p>Then there is another up. Do not simply go up by yourself. You must bring up something of gold and something of silver (Ezra 1:11). These are the experiences of Christ. All the vessels in the temple are the experiences of the various aspects of Christ. The people of God were scattered and all the spiritual experiences were carried away. That was a shame to them and to God. Nebuchadnezzar put all the vessels in the temple of his idols. What a shame to God! Even today, some dear Christians have real experiences of Christ, but they are in Babylon. They have the experiences of Christ in the place of captivity, and in the place of idols. The experiences are right, but the place is wrong. The vessels are right, but they are the vessels of the temple of God in the temple of idols. So we must bring them up.<p>Ezra is not a long book. But it takes time to tell us all the numbers of the vessels. There were 5,400 vessels. When we are recovered, we must bring up some of the experiences of Christ. There are the vessels of gold and the vessels of silver. In typology silver refers to Christ&#8217;s redemption, and gold refers to God&#8217;s divine nature. Our experiences while we are going up must be the experiences of Christ and His redemption and of God and His divine nature. We must go up to bring up something of Christ and of God. We should not go up with our hands empty. At least we should have one vessel of gold and one vessel of silver.<p>It is so interesting that this part of the Word only gives us the names of two kinds of vessels: the platters and the bowls (Ezra 1:9-10). The words chargers and basins should be changed to platters and bowls in these verses. The platters are the large plates, and the bowls are for eating and drinking. Both are for serving food.<p>What experiences do you have of Christ? Those experiences must be the plates and the bowls to supply and to serve food to others. When we are going up to the church life, are we going up with anything in our hands? We must go up to the church life with plates and with bowls to serve others with food that they may be nourished and supplied. I do believe that many dear ones who are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today can give testimony of how they have gone up to the church life with something in their hands as plates and bowls to supply others. And they can testify that when they came into the church life, they were simply nourished. They have something in their hands to nourish others, and others have something in their hands to nourish them; so they just nourish one another. This is the church life. You have some plates, and I have some plates. You have some bowls, and I have some bowls. You serve me, and I serve you. We all must serve one another.<p>Eventually we must be built up (Ezra 1:2, 3, 5). So we must be stirred up, rise up, go up, bring up, and build up. We must be stirred up in the spirit, rise up with the body, go up to Jerusalem, and bring up the experiences of Christ that we may build up the church.<h2 class=head1>IN SPIRIT</h2><p>Even the Old Testament tells us to be stirred up in our human spirit. The church is not a human society, but a divine economy. This is not a human movement, but a divine movement, a divine moving. Therefore, God needs our spirit. God stirs up our spirit. Do not consider and analyze too much with your mind, and do not be so emotional or so determined. We all must be stirred up in our spirit. To understand in the mind is one thing, but to be stirred up in the spirit is another. I am afraid that some of us may be clear in our mind about the Lord&#8217;s recovery, but so poor in our spirit. May God be merciful to us and speak to our spirit. God must touch our spirit. He must deliver us out of our mind and turn us to the spirit. Then we will not care so much for our mind, and we will not care so much for our emotions or our will. We will go on with the Lord in His recovery because we have been stirred up in spirit.<h2 class=head1>A NEW BEGINNING</h2><p>Ezra 1 begins with, &#8220;Now in the first year of Cyrus.&#8221; Why was it not the second year or the third year? Why was it the first year? Because the recovery is a real new beginning. If today we are stirred up in the spirit for the Lord&#8217;s recovery this will be the first year to us. This will be a new beginning. The first year of King Cyrus was the beginning of a new reign. I hope that among those who read this message, many will say, &#8220;Hallelujah, this year is the first year of my church life! Now I know that I must go up to Jerusalem!&#8221;<p>Some may ask, &#8220;If they go up to Jerusalem, what about all the rest who will not go up?&#8221; Do not consider that much-just go up! Why do you have to consider so much regarding others? If God has stirred up your spirit, you must go up, regardless of what others do. History tells us that only a small number of the captivity went back to Jerusalem; the majority remained in captivity.<p>We know that besides the temple in Jerusalem, there has never been another temple built up by the Jewish people in the entire earth. Instead, they have built up many synagogues. They have not dared to build up a temple, because they know too well God&#8217;s commandment in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16. If we only rise up, yet we do not go up to the church life, we may serve God, but we will only serve God in a synagogue. We can never serve God in the temple simply because we have only been raised up. We need not only to be raised up, but also to go up. We should not serve God on a lower level; we must go up. Some may say that they can preach the gospel where they are. Yes, they can preach the gospel on a low level. And some may say that they have the presence of God. In a sense I agree with them, but they have the presence of God on a low level. We all need to go up! up to Jerusalem! up to the ground of unity! up to the unique ground of the church!<p>I am so happy that in these past years we have seen many dear ones who have been stirred up, have risen up, and have gone up to bring up and build up. Now today, in so many places, they are building up. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! stirred up! rise up! go up! bring up! and now build up! We build up what we bring up. This is a summary of God&#8217;s recovery.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ONENESS, THE PRIESTHOOD, THE KINGSHIP, AND THE ALTAR</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Ezra 3:1-2</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ONENESS</h2><p>Chapter one of Ezra tells us that God stirred up the spirit of some of the captives in Babylon. After their spirit was stirred up, they rose up to go back to Jerusalem, bringing with them vessels of gold and silver. Their intention in going back was to build up the house of God. Ezra 3:1 then tells us that &#8220;the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.&#8221; The seventh month was come, and although the people of Israel were in the cities, no oneness had yet been realized. But then &#8220;the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.&#8221; That was the real oneness, the real harmony; not in the cities, but in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the unique ground, the unique center for oneness and for unity.<p>How do we apply these things to ourselves today? If we are the remnant from captivity that has come back to Jerusalem, we need the real oneness and harmony. We all must be one. We must be gathered together as one man. We all must be as one man, not in this place or in that, but in Jerusalem. It is not according to my opinion or your way, my concept or your teaching. It is according to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the center. Can we forsake all our opinions for Jerusalem? Can we forget about all our concepts for Jerusalem? We all have come back, but we must not come back with the influence of Babylon. We must forget about the things of Babylon. Do not come back with the teachings of Babylon. Let us all come up to Jerusalem. Then nothing will be according to you or me, but according to Jerusalem, for Jerusalem is the unique center and the unique ground for oneness.<p>In the past years, I have been watching and observing. I have discovered that some saints have begun to meet in different places, but eventually the meetings failed because of their different opinions and concepts. The problem is that some have come back, but they have not brought back the vessels. Instead, they have brought with them the things of Babylon. They have come back with so many Babylonian concepts. They have come back, but they did not have oneness and unity. They have never been gathered together as one man.<p>I must praise the Lord for the local churches. In the local churches, by the Lord&#8217;s mercy, we are just as one man. We have no different opinions, we have dropped all the Babylonian concepts, and we have gathered together as one. Since the Lord gave us pray-reading we have really been brought into oneness. Praise the Lord! We need the oneness. Without oneness and unity, the building up of the house of the Lord is impossible.<p>If we are going to realize the church life, we must forget about all the dissenting teachings and opinions we have received in the past. We must forsake all of these things. Different opinions, concepts, and knowledge of the Bible have caused much trouble. This is dreadful!<p>This is why, following the degradation of the church, the last book of the Bible was written in a different way. In the Gospels and in the Epistles, the order of the Persons of the Godhead is Father, Son, and Spirit. But in the last book, the order of the Godhead is changed to Father, Spirit, and Son. Now the Spirit is more important, and has been changed from the third place to the second. Moreover, the one Spirit has become the seven Spirits, the sevenfold, intensified Spirit.<p>The Lord Jesus said many things in the four Gospels, and the apostles wrote many books, but none of these told us as strongly as the book of Revelation that we must listen to the speaking of the Spirit. This last book tells us at the end of each of the seven epistles, &#8220;He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith.&#8221; Christianity has many Bible studies, Bible classes, and Bible institutes, but they are nearly all in the dead letters.<p>Instead of Bible study classes, we need weeping classes to weep for the spiritual poverty and deadness. We must listen to the Spirit-not just read what is written. We must listen to the present, instant speaking of the living Spirit. &#8220;He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.&#8221; To read the writings is not sufficient. The age has been turned to the Spirit.<p>Why have Christians been divided? It is simply because of the different teachings and doctrines. The more teachings there are, the more divisions there will be. All the various teachings and opinions have done much damage to the recovery of the church. I fear that some of us are still under the influence of the Babylonian doctrines. May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may forsake all of those teachings, regardless of whether they are right or wrong. Let us go back to Jerusalem with the Spirit. Our mentality has done much damage to the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We simply need to turn to the Spirit.<p>In the past fifteen to twenty years, the Lord has shown us clearly that Christ is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Second Corinthians 3:17 also says, &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; Based upon these Scriptures, we have told people that they must realize that Christ is not only the Redeemer, but also the life-giving Spirit. But some have condemned this, saying that it is heresy to say that Christ is the Spirit. They say that this is wrong and is against the teaching of the Trinity. But the Bible tells us clearly that &#8220;now the Lord is the Spirit&#8221;! We do not care for man&#8217;s deadly teachings; we only care for the enjoyment of the living Christ as the Spirit!<p>Suppose the book of Revelation did not say anything about the seven Spirits of God, and yet someone told us that today the Spirit of God is the seven Spirits. Would you believe it? I am afraid that all Christians would say that this man is a heretic. The Spirit of God is the one unique Spirit. How could anyone say that He is the seven Spirits! But praise the Lord! We do have this last book of Revelation, and it tells us that the Spirit of God is not only one Spirit, but seven Spirits. Is this heresy? If this is a heresy, it is divine heresy! It is a divine heresy even out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ! Oh, deadly teachings really cause a lot of damage both to the Christian life and to the church life. The Spirit of God is one. How can you say seven? But the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit is the seven Spirits. Then what shall we say? We have to say, &#8220;Amen! Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!&#8221;<p>I am afraid that within you are still some &#8220;buts.&#8221; You may say &#8220;This is quite good, but, but...&#8221; That little &#8220;but&#8221; is of Satan. All of us must learn to reject the &#8220;buts.&#8221; We must not have &#8220;buts&#8221;; we must only have oneness. No more &#8220;buts,&#8221; but all &#8220;Amens!&#8221; All the &#8220;buts&#8221; must be given up. We must not have any opinions so that we all might be gathered as one man. Never say, &#8220;but&#8221;; simply be one with the saints. Let us all be gathered together as one man to Jerusalem. We must not care for anything except the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We must only care for the building up of the temple of the Lord. Let us all come back to Jerusalem to be gathered as one man!<h2 class=head1>THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGSHIP</h2><p>There is something more in Ezra 3:2. The names of two people are mentioned: Joshua and Zerubbabel. From the books of Haggai and Zechariah, we know that Joshua was the high priest at that time. According to Haggai, Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah, and if we trace his genealogy, we see that he was the descendant of David. So he was in the line of the kingship. Therefore, there are these two people: Joshua, representing the priesthood, and Zerubbabel, representing the kingship. In the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah, these two things are always represented. This is because these books are connected with the recovery of the building of the house and the city of God.<p>The building up of the house of God always requires the priesthood and the kingship. For the building of the tabernacle, Moses represented the kingship and the authority, and Aaron represented the priesthood. For the building up of the temple, Solomon represented the kingship, and the high priest represented the priesthood. And for the recovery of the building, the priesthood and the kingship are still necessary. In the original building, there was first the kingship and then the priesthood. But with the recovery, there is first the priesthood and then the kingship. The kingship is the divine authority, and the priesthood is simply to contact God, to be saturated with God, and to be occupied and possessed by God.<p>For the recovery of the building of the local churches, it is not only a matter of giving up the denominations in order to come back to the local ground, but also a matter of the priesthood and the kingship. Praise the Lord that many have come back! But in the past years, I have noticed that in many places, although the people came back, they were still short of the priesthood and the kingship. They did not have Joshua and they did not have Zerubbabel. They left the denominations and came back with the intention to recover the church life, but they failed because they did not have the priesthood and the kingship. They thought that when they came back they could use a certain way to practice the church life, but it did not work. The church life is not a matter of a certain way; it is a matter of the priesthood and the kingship.<p>Are we in the priesthood, and are we under the kingship? We need the priesthood in order to have a real contact with God, that our whole being may be saturated with God. It is not a matter of having a certain way to conduct our meetings- this will never work. It is a matter of the priesthood. Are we in the priesthood? Do we know something of the priesthood by experience? Are we helping others to experience the priesthood? It is not a matter of this or that; it is a matter of the priesthood. We all must contact the Lord, be filled and saturated with the Lord, and be occupied with Him day by day. We must have the priesthood in this way. All the dear ones in the Lord&#8217;s recovery must be helped to realize the proper priesthood. We all must contact the Lord. To shout for joy in the meetings is good, but what about your contact with the Lord in your private life? How much do you contact the Lord, and how much are you being saturated with the Lord in your daily life? This is the priesthood. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we must have the priesthood; we must have Joshua.<p>We also need the kingship, the divine authority. People always ask if we have someone ruling the church. I always reply that it is rather hard to say. If you say that we do, I say that we do not. If you say that we do not, I say that we do. Who rules the meetings of the church in Los Angeles? If you say that no one rules, I will not agree. But if you say that someone does rule, I also will not agree. It is all a matter of learning how to submit to divine authority. There is a kind of divine kingship among us, and we are all under that kingship. We do not need an election for a leader. We need to be under divine authority.<p>In some places the saints have told me that it is really difficult to decide who will be the leaders. Sometimes I have spoken to the people in this way: whoever wants to be a leader is not qualified to be a leader. If someone is ambitious to be a leader among the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, that is a shame. A leader is simply a leader. If you are a leader, everybody knows that you are a leader. You are what you are. If we know divine authority and realize the kingship among us, we all will know our place. We will know who we are, what we are, and where we are. We will know because we are under the kingship and authority which is the headship of the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head1>THE ALTAR</h2><p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, there is the need of the priesthood and the kingship; then there will be something recovered. Ezra 3 tells us that the first thing recovered was the altar. For the recovery of the house we need the recovery of the altar. Without the altar, the house can never be recovered. The altar is the place to offer all things to the Lord. This is the recovery of the real consecration.<p>According to Ezra 3, they did not offer anything except the burnt offering upon the altar. They did not offer the sin offering, the trespass offering, the peace offering, or any other offering. They only offered the burnt offering. We all know that the burnt offering is for God&#8217;s satisfaction. The sin offering is for sins, the trespass offering is for our trespasses, the peace offering is for our peace, the meal offering is for our satisfaction, but the burnt offering is for God&#8217;s satisfaction. To recover the house is for God&#8217;s satisfaction. The house is not for us to be forgiven; it is not for us to have peace with God; it is not for our enjoyment; it is wholly for God&#8217;s satisfaction. Therefore, we must offer nothing but the burnt offering. In other words, we must put all that we have, all that we are, and all that we can do on the altar for God&#8217;s satisfaction. This is the start of the church life. Before we can have the church life, we must put everything on the altar. The young people must offer their college degrees and their scholarships, and we all must offer all that we have and are on the altar for God&#8217;s satisfaction. Otherwise, it is impossible to recover God&#8217;s house.<p>In some places I have observed that certain brothers like to bear responsibility in the church life, but they are still in the world. They have not put all that they have and are on the altar. We need a consecration to offer everything on the altar for the building up of the local churches.<p>Many of the churches have a real burden that local seeking ones be added. But eventually, they only have a small number. I tell you frankly that if you will offer everything-what you have, what you can do, and what you are-on the altar, the Lord will bring in the seeking ones. The problem is that we have come back from Babylon to Jerusalem, yet at Jerusalem we still keep many things for our own interest. We would not offer everything on the altar for His interest and for His satisfaction. This is why we need consecration.<p>In Ezra 3 they offered burnt offerings morning and evening every day. And they offered the burnt offerings continually. All the time there was something burning on the altar. Only this type of consecration can bring about the building up of the churches.<p>If we really mean business with the Lord, we must offer everything on the altar. Otherwise, we had better go back to Babylon. We should not come back to Jerusalem and yet still maintain our life just as it was in Babylon. The life in Jerusalem must be absolutely for the Lord&#8217;s interest. The life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery must be absolutely for the recovery of the building up of the churches.<p>A few of the churches have had little increase. If they mean business with the Lord, they will be desperate to pray, &#8220;Lord, give us an increase; otherwise, we will die!&#8221; We must make ourselves cold or hot. If we are cold, let us be freezing. If we are hot, let us be so hot that people will say we are crazy. Let people say that we are too much. We all must be so mad, so burning for the local church. If we will be so burning, we will see the increase of the church. We do not care what people say about us; we must be absolutely for the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>The first thing to be recovered for the church life is the altar. We all need to recover the altar by praying, &#8220;Lord, this day we put upon the altar everything we have, everything we are, and everything we can do. We do it for Your house, Your church.&#8221; This is what we need. We need the oneness, we need the priesthood, we need the kingship, and we need the altar. Then the foundation of the temple will be laid for the recovery of the building of the churches.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>LAYING THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION OF CHRIST</h1><p>So far we have covered four main points: the oneness, the priesthood, the kingship, and the altar. The fifth point is the laying of the foundation. All four previous points are for this. The oneness, the priesthood, the kingship, and the altar are all for laying the foundation. So we need to apply all of these things in a practical way.<p>We do not need much teaching, but we do need some practical application. During the past years of watching and observing, I have noticed that in some places, although it seemed that the people had come back to Jerusalem, no foundation had been laid. Year after year no foundation was laid. A group of people had come back to claim the proper ground of the church life, but there was no foundation.<p>After we have returned to Jerusalem and have claimed the proper ground, the urgent need is to lay the foundation. We are not for the ground; we are for the foundation. Although we need to come to the unique ground of unity, we are not for the ground, but for the foundation. I believe we all know who the foundation is. The foundation is Jesus Christ. &#8220;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:11). This is the unique foundation on the unique ground.<p>Some say that we emphasize the ground too much and simply forget the foundation. We do not admit this. We take the ground for the foundation. We take the ground for Christ. But I have noticed that some who come back have laid a foundation which is not Christ. In some places they claim to have taken the ground, yet they have not laid Christ as their foundation. Instead, speaking in tongues or something else other than Christ Himself is their foundation. Regardless of how good it is, as long as it is not Christ Himself, it is not the proper foundation. Such a foundation becomes a divisive factor. We may say that we have returned to take the unique ground, yet we lay a divisive foundation. Do you see how subtle this is? So we must be extremely careful.<p>I like the book of Ezra because there is not much teaching in it. In the beginning they did not have the prophets. All they had was the oneness, the priesthood, the kingship, and the altar.<p>In some places today, they do not have the oneness, they do not have the priesthood, they do not have the kingship, and they do not have the altar. They only have many prophets. It seems they have nothing but mouths in the Body. Even the toe becomes a mouth. There is much talking and many doctrines, but no oneness, no priesthood, and no kingship. They simply do not care about bringing people into the presence of God to help them contact the Lord and be possessed by the Lord. They only care for the teachings of the Bible. They have many prophets, but no priests. They do not care for God&#8217;s altar, and they do not care for the divine authority, the kingship. They simply have much talk with many opinions.<h2 class=head1>FOOLISHLY ONE</h2><p>Praise the Lord that at the beginning of the recovery there was no prophet. The people simply came together as one man. Some may say that they were ignorant and foolish, but let us all be so foolish! Let us come together as one man foolishly. We do not need to be so clever and wise. We must simply come together with the Lord&#8217;s people to be one man. We must learn to be so foolish, without any opinions. Could you learn to only open your mouth for praising and never for speaking? This is what we mean by being foolish.<p>Many do not know how to bring people into the presence of the Lord, they do not know how to submit themselves under the headship of Christ, and they do not know how to be one with others. They simply do not know how to give up their opinions and be foolishly one with others. They do not know how to put everything upon the altar. There is absolutely no consecration. If the situation is like this, it is dreadful indeed. I prefer to be in a place with foolish people, where everyone is filled with Christ, everyone is under the headship of Christ, and everyone puts everything on the altar. If others say that we are foolish, we say: &#8220;Praise the Lord, we are so spiritually foolish!&#8221;<p>In the beginning of Ezra, there were no teachers and no prophets. Today&#8217;s Christianity always thinks that to build up a church we need a great teacher. But be sure that a great teacher will bring great troubles, a small teacher will cause only small troubles, and no teacher produces no trouble. If there are two big teachers, be sure there will be two big divisions. There is no need to argue about this matter; it has been proven by history.<p>All troubles and all the divisions have come from the teachers. Wherever there is a teacher, it is certain there will be trouble and division. Mere teaching never builds-it only divides and tears down.<p>I really like this book of Ezra. From the beginning there is no teacher and no prophet. There is just the oneness. All the people came together to Jerusalem as one man (Ezra 3:1). If we do not learn to be foolish, we can never be one with others. All the clever people can never be one. I am always afraid of the clever ones. Do not be so clever; then you can be one with others.<p>Sometimes someone will say that a certain person is a good brother. But I always want to know how good! If he is foolishly good, that is marvelous. But if he is cleverly good, I will run away from him. I cannot tell you how much I have suffered in the past from clever ones. In the church, the Lord does not need any clever people. The first clever one was Judas who betrayed the Lord Jesus. He was really clever. When we read the New Testament, we see that all the disciples and early believers were built up together because they were foolishly one.<p>How can we be one? We must give up our opinions and become foolish. All the people in the beginning of the New Testament came together as one. They had the priesthood, they had the kingship, and they put everything on the altar to be burnt. Do you not think that they were foolish? If I were there, I might ask them, &#8220;What are you doing? We need all those things for the Lord&#8217;s work.&#8221; They were really foolish.<p>What I mean is this: if we look into the situation at the time of Ezra, what they were doing was foolish. When all the adversaries saw these foolish people put everything on the altar and burn it, they were happy. But later when the adversaries saw the laying of the foundation, they were not so happy. In the beginning it seemed foolish-there was no teaching, and they did not call the congregation together to give them instructions. No, they all came together as one man. And they had the priesthood, the kingship, and the altar. Brothers and sisters, we all need to be so foolish. Do not be taught and instructed to be so clever. Learn to be so simple and foolish that you put everything on the altar.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO LAY THE FOUNDATION</h2><p>The oneness, the priesthood, the kingship, and the altar are the preparation for laying the foundation. According to typology, this foundation is nothing but Christ. They laid Christ as their foundation. They did not care for anything but Christ, and we must be the same. We do not care for prophesying, we do not care for healing, we do not care for speaking in tongues, and we do not care for foot-washing or head-covering. We do not care for anything but Christ. Our foundation is nothing but Christ. Yes, we take the ground of the church, but we are not for the ground. The ground is for the foundation, and the foundation is Christ and Christ alone.<p>Pray-reading is not our foundation. Pray-reading is a means to lay the foundation. Pray-reading is a means to build. We thank the Lord that in the past years we have seen much building by pray-reading. Pray-reading truly builds, but it is not the foundation. Our foundation is Christ alone.<p>How do we lay the foundation? The foundation is laid by praising and shouting. &#8220;And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord; because He is good, for His mercy endureth forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. But many of the priests and Levites and chiefs of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: so that people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off&#8221; (Ezra  3:10-13).<p>If we are going to another place, we do not need to teach or preach so much. We must simply go there and shout and praise concerning Christ. If we go there to praise Christ, I believe there will be a firm foundation laid.<p>Why do we have to follow the old way? We come to the meetings and sit waiting for someone to call a hymn. Then we all sing. Why do we follow this old way? Where is the scriptural ground for this way? Why do we have to have a message in all our meetings? Why do we not have a shouting meeting? I shout to you and you shout to me, &#8220;Brothers, Christ is my life! Christ is Victor!&#8221; Then another will shout, &#8220;Yes, Christ is Victor!&#8221; But we should not make this another way. We must be so new and living. I have the deep conviction that the Lord is going to tear down the old way. I do not think the old way of preaching will be so prevailing. There must be something new.<p>How did they lay the foundation? By shouting and praising. When Christianity is going to build a church building, they have a certain kind of celebration to lay the foundation. They sing a hymn, and the pastor will read a portion of the Word. Then another will give a message. This is the old and dead way, the way with no life. That is not Christ as the foundation. If they declare Christ as the foundation, everyone will shout, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221;<p>Look at the record in Ezra. Some shouted and some wept. There was no order. If you go to the cemetery, there is no need for you to tell those who are there to stay in order. They are already orderly because they are dead and buried. If we are living, it is rather difficult to keep a strict order. We all know that according to history, the Hebrew people were so religious, but according to this record, there was not much religion. They came together as one man. Is this religious? They put everything on the altar to be burned. And when they laid the foundation, they shouted and wept so much that they could not discern who was shouting and who was weeping. Is this religious?<p>When we get back to the proper ground, we must pray that such a foundation will be laid. Do not call a meeting and say, &#8220;Brothers, please open to 1 Corinthians 3:11. We must all know that the unique foundation is Christ.&#8221; This is dead teaching! You are right, but you are deadly right. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we do not need this kind of dead teaching. When we come back, we must come back shouting, praising, and full of Christ without any teaching. This will be wonderful.<p>Not long ago while traveling, I had a three-hour layover in a certain place where there was a local church. Two brothers met me at the airport and we had some fellowship. They told me that a brother from their place had gone to Los Angeles and stayed for three weeks. When he came back, the first time he came to the meeting, he shouted, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; Everyone in the meeting knew that this brother had returned from Los Angeles. They had not seen him, but they heard his &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; He was so bubbling. This was really good. But if this brother had come back to teach them to shout &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; the way they do it in Los Angeles, this would be wrong. He would just be asking people to shout in a dead way. It is not a matter of imitating, but of being filled with Christ. When we lay Christ as the foundation, we are so happy we shout &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; We have no other foundation but Christ. We do not care for this, we do not care for that-we only care for Christ. This is the unique foundation of the house of God. We have seen it, and we are in it. Praise the Lord!<h2 class=head1>THE SUBTLETY OF THE ENEMY</h2><p>After the foundation was laid, something happened. The laying of the foundation disturbed the adversaries. They realized that something really serious had occurred, so they came in a subtle way. &#8220;Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel; then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them. &#8216;Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.&#8217; But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, &#8216;Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.&#8217; Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius, king of Persia&#8221; (Ezra 4:1-5).<p>In the past years we also have heard this kind of saying again and again: &#8220;Brother, let us work together with you. We are the same as you are.&#8221; Whoever says, &#8220;We are the same as you are,&#8221; is not the same. If he were the same, there would be no need for him to say so. He would simply come to be one with you. We must not be cheated.<p>In the Far East, some missionaries came to me and said, &#8220;Brother, let us help one another. We are the same as you are. You have given up denominations, and we are non- denominational.&#8221; But I had to say &#8220;Brother, you are not the same as we are.&#8221; Then I pointed out what they were and what we were. This is a subtle frustration of the enemy. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we should never have any mixture. It must be one hundred percent pure. If we take this way, be prepared for people to say that we are narrow. We all need to be so narrow. To try to be broad is a subtlety of the enemy.<p>Who were the people who said that we seek God as you do? They were those who were very close to Jerusalem. The closest ones are the most troublesome ones. Do not listen to this kind of saying: &#8220;We are the same as you are.&#8221; We rejected this kind of subtle proposal; so immediately the opposition came. If we are clear about the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we must be sold for this one thing and nothing else. Since we are spoiled for the recovery, we are good for nothing else. We cannot work together with others who are very close, yet so different, because the Lord&#8217;s recovery is unique.<p>Let us look at the situation. There was Jerusalem, Egypt, Syria, and Babylon. No doubt there was much work for God in Babylon. They built many synagogues, and they did much work to bring people to know God and the law of Moses. And I believe there were good works even in Syria and Egypt. Those who said, &#8220;We seek your God as you do,&#8221; had been brought from Syria to a place close to Jerusalem. I believe they were the ancestors of the Samaritans. In John 4 we see that the Samaritans spoke much about worshipping God.<p>Suppose you were an Israelite in Jerusalem. Those who were close by might say, &#8220;Why must you be so peculiar? So many here are devoted people of God, and they love you. Why would you not stay with them? You say that you must go to Jerusalem, but isn&#8217;t this too narrow? You only have twelve meeting with you, and they have twelve thousand! Why don&#8217;t you stay with the twelve thousand? Why go back to the twelve?&#8221; If you were not so clear, you would immediately be confused. You would even speak to others and ask, &#8220;What are we doing here when there are so many dear ones who are not in Jerusalem? Why don&#8217;t we go and join them? Why should we keep our small group here?&#8221; If you were not clear, you would be brought away from Jerusalem.<p>There is much work for God here in this place, and there in that place. And it is very close to the recovery too. It is not something in Babylon, Syria, or Egypt, but near to Jerusalem. They even say that they are the same as you are. Then what will you say? I am afraid that you may think that the Lord has sent you some helpers. But these are not helpers, they are frustrators. One brother might say, &#8220;Praise the Lord, these people are not in Syria, or in Egypt, or Babylon, and they are so close to us. If we just help them a little, they will be brought in.&#8221; But they will help you a little to be brought out! Do not say that they are so close. Their subtlety is to come in to bring you out. You must build up the wall and close the door. I know the subtle one will say that this is narrow and sectarian. But we must know what it means to be sectarian. To be sectarian is absolutely a matter of the ground. If you are in Jerusalem you can never be sectarian. But if you are not on the proper ground, regardless of how broad and all-inclusive you are, you are still sectarian. As long as you are in Babylon, no matter how broad you are, you are divisive because you are standing on divisive ground. As long as we are on the proper ground, we are standing for the unique unity which is for all the children of God.<p>It was not the subtlety that stopped the building work, it was the opposition. The opposition began because they were not absolute. They were clear, but they were not absolute. Because they were clear they could not be stopped by the subtle proposal, but because they were not absolute and strong, they were stopped by the opposition. &#8220;Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes&#8217; letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia&#8221; (Ezra 4:23-24).<h2 class=head1>THE COMING OF THE PROPHETS</h2><p>It was at this time that the prophets came. &#8220;Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them....And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes kings of Persia. And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king&#8221; (Ezra 5:1-2; 6:14-15).<p>The prophets came because the people were weakened and were not in a normal condition. Whenever the Lord raises up the prophets, that is a proof that the situation is not normal. In the normal situation there is no need of the prophets, but just the priesthood and the kingship-these two are sufficient. But in Ezra the situation became abnormal, so there was the need of the prophet. When the purpose of the building up of the house of God was frustrated, God raised up Haggai and Zechariah. And even Zechariah was a priest-prophet. This kind of prophet must be related to the priesthood.<p>When we are frustrated from the rebuilding of the house of God, we need the strengthening of the prophets. In all the books of God&#8217;s recovery, you will find that there is not much teaching or different kinds of opinions and concepts. This is why I love these books. These books show us that when the people returned, they did not bring back these things. They were so simple. But because they were weak and related to the world, they needed the help of the prophets to be strengthened and separated from the world.<p>Today we must all realize that in the recovery of the church life we do not need much teaching. What we need is the priesthood and the kingship, the altar, and the real foundation of Christ. The church life is built upon nothing but Christ. Do not think that when the prophets came they gave many teachings. No, they strengthened the hands of the people to carry on the recovery in a proper way. We must all learn to be so simple and drop all our opinions and concepts. We must leave the teachings and simply come together under the divine authority to lay the foundation of the unique Christ.<p>We must be careful and strong not to be cheated by the subtle proposal of others to come and help us. There is no help from that source. We must be clear that regardless of what people say about us, we know what we are doing. And we know that we are absolute for the recovery. We are not good for anything else.<p>In the past years I have been criticized very much. Many times when I was in Taiwan, friends came to rebuke me: &#8220;Brother Lee, we know you do not care for anything but the local churches. You are building up a local church sect.&#8221; This is what they said. I never argued; I just nodded my head. I said, &#8220;Brother, you are one hundred percent right. I am here for nothing but the local church. I am sold, wrecked, and spoiled for Christ and the church. Don&#8217;t expect me to come to help you. If I did, I would cause you much trouble. Save your time and mine also.&#8221; I was very frank to speak the truth.<p>Some of the missionaries in China said, &#8220;That is a marvelous piece of work, but....&#8221; There is a big &#8220;but.&#8221; To them, the &#8220;but&#8221; is like a dead fly in the ointment. What is the dead fly? The church ground. Some have said to me that if I would not say anything about the ground I would become a wonderful and popular speaker. But I told them that I do not like to be so popular and wonderful. I like to be faithful and speak about the ground!<p>Some say, &#8220;Brother Lee, why must you offend others? Just preach Christ-that is sufficient. Why do you have to speak about the ground? This really offends people.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I know I offend you, because you came here to build up the Presbyterian Church, and I am for the local church. Your aim is to build up a missionary church, and our goal is to build up the local church. How can I please you?&#8221;<p>If we do not take the Lord&#8217;s way today to build up the local church, what shall we do? There is no way to go on. In 1933, when I was raised up by the Lord in this way, I was much criticized. Even my dearest friends became so antagonistic to me. It was really a burden. Then I went to the Lord and became so clear. I said to myself, If I am going to be a human being, I must be a Christian. Otherwise, it is better for me to die. There is no need to be a man without being a Christian. And if I am going to be a Christian, I must take the way of the local ground. If I do not take the way of the local church, I have no way. It is better for me to quit being a Christian. It is so simple.<p>Your own experiences will prove that unless you see the local church, you will never be satisfied. Something deep within you tells you that there is something missing until the day you come to the local church. Then you have the sense that you are home. Why? Because you are home! If you are not home, you simply feel that you are lacking something. Brothers, there is no other way. If we do not take the local church, there is no need for us to set up a meeting at any other place. That is meaningless. If we do not take the local church, why must we have another meeting? There are so many Christian groups already-why not go and join them? You may say that it is rather difficult to work together with them and that it is better to start another meeting. If this is so, then you are really sectarian! If you do not have the intention to join the local church, I would advise you to go back to join some Christian group. There is no need to set up some other kind of meeting. That is really meaningless.<p>Bring these matters to the Lord and you will say, &#8220;Lord, from now on, I am good for nothing but the local church. I do not know anything but the local church.&#8221; The Lord will honor this kind of prayer. Look at the situation of the recovery in ancient days. Those people who returned seemed so foolish. They did not know anything and they did not care for anything but the recovery of the building up of the house of God. This is exactly what we must do. We must be for nothing but the recovery of the building up of the local churches.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>HAGGAI-&#8220;CONSIDER YOUR WAYS&#8221;</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Hag. 1:1-2:9</h1><h2 class=head1>THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGSHIP</h2><p>Haggai speaks, first of all, not to the people, but to the governor and the high priest. &#8220;In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest&#8221; (Hag. 1:1). Then after speaking to the governor and the high priest, he speaks to the people (Hag. 1:13; 2:2).<p>Why is it necessary to mention that Haggai speaks first to the governor and to the high priest? Because for the building up of the house of God there is the need of the kingship and the priesthood. The priesthood is the ministry that brings the people into the presence of God and helps them to contact God, be saturated, and even occupied by God. In the building up of the house of God, there is the need of such a ministry. We do need this kind of saturation, fellowship, and oneness with God for the building up of the local churches. We do not need the knowledge of the teachings, but we do need the saturation, the oneness, the fellowship, and the living contact with God. This is not the ministry of teaching, but the ministry of the priesthood, and this ministry will help us to be real priests. We all must learn to contact the Lord and be saturated with the Lord. This is the first need for the building up of the local churches.<p>Then there is the need of the kingship. The kingship is simply the headship of Christ, the divine authority. In the local churches, the government is not like that of the world. In the world there are different types of governments. Some are run by the people, and some are run by a dictator. But the government in the local churches is neither by the people nor by a dictatorship. In the local churches the government must be the divine authority which is the headship of Christ, the kingship with divine authority.<p>The normal situation in a local church is that of an adequate priesthood and kingship. This means we all know how to contact the Lord, how to have living fellowship with the Lord, how to be saturated with the Lord, and how to be occupied with the Lord. And we all know how to submit ourselves to the leadership of Christ, that is, to recognize the divine authority among the Lord&#8217;s people in the local churches. If we have these two things, what a wonderful situation that will be!<p>I believe that many of us read the last article written by Dr. A. W. Tozer before he died. In this message he pointed out that in today&#8217;s Christianity, the headship of Christ is completely renounced. He said that in all the church services, conventions, and conferences, the headship of Christ is not recognized. This is why there is the confusion and divisions with the many different kinds of opinions. Because the headship of Christ has not been recognized by His people, there is no divine authority among the Christians; there is only confusion and division. Everyone does whatever is right in his own eyes. There is no kingship.<p>In the local churches we are all under the kingship and headship of Christ. If I must say something, I must say it under the kingship and headship of my Lord. If it is not under His ruling, His authority, I should not say anything. Whatever I say and do must be under the headship of Christ. Nothing rules over me except His headship. I recognize the kingship of Christ in the local churches.<p>In the summer of 1966, we covered the matter of the priesthood and the kingship quite thoroughly. All of these messages have been published in The Stream (from Vol. 5, No. 4 through Vol. 6, No. 4). For the building up of the house of God we need the priesthood and the kingship.<p>I feel that I must repeat some of these things again, because they simply are not in our human concept. For the raising up of the tabernacle, Moses represented the divine authority, and the high priest, Aaron, represented the priesthood. It was under these two ministries that the tabernacle was raised up. For the building of the temple, king David fought the battle to bring in peace. Then king Solomon represented the divine authority and the high priest represented the priesthood. Under these two, the temple was built up. Now in the recovery of the building of the temple, there are Zerubbabel the governor, representing the kingship, and Joshua the high priest, representing the priesthood. It is only under these two ministries that the recovery of the building of the temple is possible.<p>Today, for the Lord&#8217;s recovery in the local churches, we still need these two ministries. I am so grateful to the Lord that here in the churches, we have seen the priesthood and the kingship. The brothers and sisters know how to contact the Lord and to have a living fellowship with the Lord day by day. This is why we have the morning watch with all the pray-reading-it is simply to contact the Lord, to have a living fellowship with the Lord, and even to be saturated, permeated, and possessed by the Lord that we may really be one with Him in spirit. And it is by this that we all have come to recognize the authority of God, the headship of Christ. No human hand is ruling over us. There is no human control, but we do have the divine authority among us. The brothers and sisters are moving and acting under the headship of Christ. If you were to ask me who are the ones who take care of the churches, I would say I just do not know how to answer. What I mean is that we do not have the maneuvering of any human hand, but we do have a government, a divine government, a government under the headship of Christ. This is the kingship.<p>When someone asks how we have our meetings, how we start our meetings, and who takes the lead in our meetings, it is really difficult for me to answer. For the building up of the house of the Lord, we have the ministry of the priesthood as well as the ministry of the kingship.<h2 class=head1>THE STRENGTHENING BY THE PROPHET</h2><p>But sometimes these two are not sufficiently strong. Then there is the need of the support and strengthening by the prophets. It is not the teaching that is required, but the ministry of the real prophet. Haggai came to strengthen Zerubbabel, the governor, and Joshua, the high priest. He did not come to replace the priesthood or the kingship, but to strengthen these two ministries. The prophet only strengthens; he does not replace.<p>For the building up of the churches, we do need the ministry of the priesthood and the ministry of the kingship. But sometimes we need the strengthening from the prophet. The prophet should not replace these two ministries, but strengthen them. Listen to what Haggai said; &#8220;Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts&#8221; (Hag. 2:4). Haggai did not build the house for them. He did not take over their position. He simply strengthened and supported them.<p>Why is it necessary to point out all these things? It is simply due to the background of Christianity. Many times in the churches, those who can speak take over the position of the priesthood and the kingship to build up the church themselves. This is wrong. Regardless of how strong their ministry is in speaking, they should not replace the others and occupy their position. All they should do is strengthen and help others.<p>Ephesians 4:12 tells us very clearly that the gifted persons such as the apostles and prophets do not build the church directly. &#8220;For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; They do the work of perfecting the saints; then the saints build up the Body directly. The gifted persons should not replace the saints; they should only perfect them so that they themselves can build up the Body.<p>Brothers and sisters, we all must experience the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship so that we all can rise up to build the house of God directly. The prophets never built the temple in the recovery directly. It was the people, under the two ministries of the priesthood and the kingship, who built the temple. The church will never be built up by any preacher or teacher. The churches must be built up by the saints. &#8220;O Zerubbabel, be strong! O Joshua, be strong!&#8221; It was the people who built the house directly, not the prophets. Today all the brothers and sisters in the churches are the builders. What we need are not simply the teachings and doctrines, but the strengthening under the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship for the building.<p>We all have the wrong concept. If by the mercy of the Lord I could help you abandon it, I will have done a good work. What is this wrong concept? We all still think that it is the great speakers and teachers who build up the church. But this is absolutely wrong! Unless the church is built up by the saints, it will never be built up! If we were to ask the people in today&#8217;s Christianity, &#8220;Who builds up the church?&#8221; immediately they would answer, &#8220;Our pastor, with the help of the assistant pastor and music director.&#8221; I am afraid that this concept is still within many of us subconsciously. Why is your church not so strong? I fear that you will say, &#8220;Our church is weak because we do not have very good elders and we are lacking good speakers.&#8221; But the church cannot be built up directly by the gifted persons. The church is to be built up by all the local saints, including you. Do not say that your church is weak because the elders are weak. You must say that it is weak because you are weak! If you are not weak and everybody else is not weak, your church will be very strong. It is the saints who build up the church directly.<h2 class=head1>A VALUABLE SECRET</h2><p>In all my experience in the local churches throughout the years, I have learned a secret. In the early years when different ones came to complain regarding something in the local churches, I would always listen to them. Then I would go to the elders to say something. The elders, then, would be unhappy with me and say that it was too easy for me to listen to others. If the brothers came to complain about the sisters, I would say something to the sisters. Then the sisters would be unhappy with me and say that it was too easy for me to listen to the brothers. Likewise, when the sisters complained about the brothers, I would say something to the brothers, and they would say it was too easy for me to listen to the sisters. Finally, I learned the lesson and the secret. This secret really solved many problems. When someone came to me, complaining about what the elders had done I would answer them in this way: &#8220;Probably you are right. Why don&#8217;t you go and tell them yourself.&#8221; They would immediately answer that they could not do it. Then I told them, &#8220;If you say it, you must also be willing to do it.&#8221; This solved many problems.<p>One day a brother told me that the men&#8217;s restroom was not clean. I asked him, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you clean it?&#8221; Another brother spoke to me regarding the lack of anyone from the church standing on the street to distribute tracts. I told him to go and do it. Eventually, the brothers began to learn that if they spoke to me about anything, I would tell them to do it. This is a good secret and solves many problems. It also stops many from being critical. Do not complain about the leading ones or about this and that. You must put the burden upon yourself. The church can only be built up by you directly. You are the direct builder.<p>Do not think if a certain brother came, he would help you. If he is a proper prophet, he will charge you to do it. The more the real prophet comes, the more burden you will have. The prophets do not come to release your burden, but to increase your burden. Be strong and work. Do not return to the clergy-laity system.<p>After the war ended in 1945, all the brothers from the interior of mainland China returned to Nanking, the capital, and invited me to their place. They were so happy that I had come, but I told them, &#8220;Brothers do not be so happy. I did not come to release your burden, but to put the burden upon you. I have come with a heavy burden, but I plan to put it on your shoulders. The longer I stay, the more my burden will be reduced and your burden will be increased. After a certain period of time, I will have no burden and you will be fully burdened.&#8221; That was in 1946. The next year I was fully released and departed; all the burden was left with the brothers. The next time they wrote me to come and help, I told them to do it themselves.<p>We all must realize that the building of the local churches is not in the hands of the prophets. All the prophets did was strengthen the priesthood, the kingship, and all the people. &#8220;O Zerubbabel, O Joshua, and all ye people, be strong and work!&#8221; This is all the prophets did. You must never put the building up of the local church upon others&#8217; shoulders. You must bear it yourselves.<h2 class=head1>CONSIDER YOUR WAYS</h2><p>The second thing that the prophet Haggai told them was to consider their ways. &#8220;Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord. Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house&#8221; (Hag. 1:6-9). Then the Lord said, &#8220;And I called for a drought&#8221; (Hag. 1:11). The Lord called for dryness upon all things. Whatever they did, they had the sense that it was so dry.<p>Look at today&#8217;s Christianity. There is so much labor-they sow the seed, they try to eat and drink, they try to clothe people, they try to earn something, but eventually they get nothing. In most Christian work today there is a sense of drought. All their preaching and teaching is dried up. Why? Their prayer meetings, their reading of the Bible, and all other kinds of meetings are so dry. Why? It is simply because they have neglected the house of God.<p>In 1954, after we had been on the island of Taiwan for about four or five years, an American missionary came to see me. We were preaching the gospel, and he had visited all of the halls. At that time, we had only about five or six halls in the church in Taipei. He was so surprised to see that every hall was full and overflowing. The people were even crowded outside the halls. He asked, &#8220;Please tell me your secret. How do you bring so many people in?&#8221; Then he went on to explain that only a few weeks ago, they had a gospel campaign with a famous preacher. They put an advertisement in the newspapers in huge characters, announcing the preacher of world fame who was coming to speak. Yet they drew only a handful of people. He said that when he asked our people in the different halls who was going to speak that night, they did not know. He was really perplexed. He asked, &#8220;How could you have such a large crowd, and yet your people did not know who was going to speak? Tell me your secret.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Brother, it is really difficult for me to tell you the secret. If you want to learn this secret, you must come and stay with us for two years. Then you will know.&#8221; Why have they sown so much, yet they bring in so little? They have Bible study after Bible study and revival after revival, yet they are still so dry and unsatisfied. Why? &#8220;Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.&#8221;<p>In the summer of 1968, over one hundred and forty brothers and sisters went from the United States to visit the churches in Taiwan. One night the church in Taipei had a baptism for about four hundred people. During the baptism, an American missionary came to the hall and began to speak with some of the American brothers. He told how the missionaries had worn out the soles of their shoes toiling in Taipei, but with little fruit. He was very bitter toward the church in Taipei because they had so many. He even claimed that many of those who were being baptized were probably the result of missionaries&#8217; work. But I told the brothers that if he could point out one of the four hundred who were baptized who had first been contacted by them before coming to us, I would lose the case. He was very bitter because they had worked so hard, and yet had nothing. Why? It was simply because they labored for their own work and not for the Lord&#8217;s house. The secret is the local church! The secret is the building up of the local churches. This is the building up of the house of the Lord.<p>This is not only true with spiritual things, but with material things as well. I am fully assured that if we mean business for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, the Lord will grant much blessing, even materially. If we are on the proper ground and mean business with the Lord for His recovery, the dew will fall from heaven when we are in need. Whatever we do, far from being dry, there will be an abundance of water. There will be not only dew, but a river. There will be real blessing both spiritually and materially.<p>Wherever I go I am always asked these questions. First, &#8220;In what way do we meet?&#8221; I always tell them to come and see. Second, &#8220;Where is your headquarters?&#8221; I always tell them we do not have any headquarters, unless it is in the heavens. Then they always ask, &#8220;How do you raise your money? With such a large work, there is the need of much money. How do you get it?&#8221; I tell them, &#8220;Yes, we do spend much money, but we do not have any way to raise it.&#8221; There is really no way, and we never talk about money. I do not like to talk about money, I like to speak about Christ! But, praise the Lord, we have never lacked money! Why? &#8220;The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts&#8221; (Hag. 2:8). If we are only for the building up of the Lord&#8217;s house, everything is for us.<p>When we began to publish the hymnal, we did not even have one dollar in our hands. Eventually, we put in more than $31,000 for its printing. When we began we did not realize it would cost nearly so much, but praise the Lord! We never had any lack. And now we have such a good hymnal for the local churches.<p>If we are going to work for the Lord, the most blessed place to work is in the local churches. Just a little sowing brings in so much. By just a little eating and drinking, we are filled. Just five loaves and two fish feed 5,000, with an abundance left over. Brothers, this is the Lord&#8217;s way. If we are for His building, all He is and all He has is available for us. Really, it is not for us; it is for His purpose of building up the house of the Lord, the local church. Praise the Lord!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS EVERYTHING FOR GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Zech. 1-8</h1><p>In this chapter, we come to another wonderful book of the recovery, Zechariah. I cannot tell you how much I love this book. Years ago it was a closed book to me, but later, due to the recovery of the local churches, it was opened. The whole book has become transparent, from the first page to the last. Of course, we do not have the time to cover it entirely, but no other book of the Old Testament tells us so much about Christ as this one. Even Isaiah cannot compare with Zechariah. Isaiah has sixty-six chapters, and Zechariah has only fourteen, yet Zechariah tells us more concerning Christ than Isaiah.<p>The fourteen chapters of Zechariah are divided into two sections: the first eight chapters are one section, and the last six are another. In the first section, there are eight visions, in which the prophet Zechariah saw the things of Christ related to the recovery of God&#8217;s building; in the last section, Zechariah prophesies about Christ in the future, after the recovery of the temple.<h2 class=head1>THE DESIRE OF ALL NATIONS</h2><p>Before we go on to Zechariah, we need to see something more regarding Haggai. In the book of Haggai, there is not much mentioned about Christ. Haggai came into the situation while the hands of the governor, the high priest, and the people were weakened by the opposition of the adversaries. They had turned from building the temple to caring for their own houses and interests. Haggai came to rebuke and strengthen them. The Spirit of God again stirred up the spirit of the governor, the spirit of the high priest, and the spirit of the remnant of the people (Hag. 1:14). Three times this verse mentions the stirring up of the human spirit. The Lord also reminded them that since the day he brought them out of Egypt, His Spirit had never left them. Their spirit had to be stirred up.<p>Here we see that the recovery of God&#8217;s building is something in our human spirit and the Lord&#8217;s divine Spirit. Our human spirit must be stirred up by His divine Spirit. It is not a matter of the mind or emotion, but a matter of His Spirit in our spirit.<p>Haggai also points out that if the recovery of the building of the Lord&#8217;s house is prevailing, Christ will come. Christ was prophesied in Haggai as &#8220;the Desire of all nations.&#8221; &#8220;And I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts&#8221; (Hag. 2:7). Christ, the Desire of all nations shall come. Have you realized that all the nations have a kind of desire? Deep within all human beings there is a desire for peace, rest, and satisfaction. But is there any peace, rest, or satisfaction? We are all aware of today&#8217;s situations with riots, wars, and tensions. There is no peace, no rest, and no satisfaction. But we know Who is the peace, the rest, the safety, the security, and the satisfaction. It is Christ, the Desire of all nations! Although the world in a sense is opposing Christ, yet Christ is their Desire. But how can Christ come as the Desire of all nations? It is only by the recovery of the building of the house of God! The recovery of the local churches has very much to do with the coming of Christ as the Desire of all nations.<p>Let us look at the situation again. Due to the degradation of God&#8217;s people, they were carried away from the land of Canaan to Syria and Egypt, with the majority going to Babylon. Suppose no one had returned from these three places of captivity to Jerusalem in the good land. How could Christ have come the first time? It was plainly prophesied that Christ, the Messiah, would be born in Bethlehem, and of the people of God. Yet all the people of God had been carried away, and if none returned, how could Christ be born of the people of Israel at Bethlehem? There would be no possibility. So we see the importance of the return of the captivity, not only for the building up of the temple, but even more for the coming of the Desire of all nations.<p>Today, many dear Christians love the Lord and are so much for the Lord&#8217;s work. Yet they still argue with us, saying, &#8220;Why must we all go back to the local church? Don&#8217;t you realize that we are doing a good work for the Lord?&#8221; But we must look at the situation. They may do much good work for the Lord in Babylon, but it is impossible for them to bring the Lord back. It is not possible for the Lord to come back as the Desire of all nations in the place of captivity. For His return, some of His people must return to the original ground. I do believe it will be the local churches that will bring Christ back! Regardless of how much they work for God in Babylon, they can never bring Christ back to the earth. It is so clear in Haggai that the recovery of the building up of God&#8217;s house has much to do with Christ&#8217;s coming as the Desire of all nations. We know that He did come, not to those who remained in Babylon, but to those who returned to the land of Israel.<h2 class=head1>THE PRIEST-PROPHET</h2><p>Haggai mentions nothing further about Christ. But in the Bible, there is always the principle of testimony. There was not just one prophet sent to the people of recovery, but two. Two is the number of testimony. The Lord sent not only Haggai, but also Zechariah. It is rather difficult for us to discover from what kind of family Haggai came. But Zechariah tells us clearly that he came from a priest&#8217;s family; so he was a priest-prophet. His prophecy was based upon his priesthood. He spoke very much concerning Christ because his ministry sprang from the priesthood. Today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we need the prophets such as Haggai to strengthen us, warn us, and stir us, but we need prophets such as Zechariah even more. Haggai has two chapters, while Zechariah with fourteen chapters is seven times greater. We do not need much of Haggai&#8217;s ministry, but we do need much ministry from Zechariah. This is because Zechariah&#8217;s ministry is the ministry of the priesthood.<p>Today so many people assume the prophethood, but they do not have the priesthood. In 1960 a Pentecostal movement began on the west coast which was quite prevailing for three or four years. That movement has quieted down now due to a prophecy which was never fulfilled. In 1963 some in that movement prophesied that there would be a huge earthquake in Los Angeles in 1964. But nothing happened. I told the brothers not to be bothered by those kinds of movements. Sooner or later, they will be terminated by their prophecies. They prophesied, but there was no fulfillment. Today in the recovery of the local church, we do not need that kind of prophet. We need the priest-prophet. We need the prophets who are the real priests, who have living contact with the Lord and who know something of Christ. Read the book of Zechariah again and again, and you will see that he did not predict anything but Christ. All he spoke about was Christ, because he was a priest contacting the Lord all the time. We need Haggai, but we need Zechariah more. We need Haggai one time, but Zechariah seven times.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Everyone understands the book of Haggai. &#8220;Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes&#8221; (Hag. 1:6-7). It is easy to understand this. And he says, &#8220;Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts&#8221; (2:4). Everybody understands this kind of prophet.<p>But when you read Zechariah, it is not so easy to understand. &#8220;I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white&#8221; (Zech. 1:8). What is this? A man was riding upon a red horse among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom. What does this mean? We must tell Zechariah that he is not as simple as Haggai. We can understand what Haggai says, but we do not know what Zechariah is speaking about!<p>In Zechariah we see something much deeper. This is the mystery of Christ. First, there was the man riding on a red horse among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom. Then, there was the vision of the four horns with four carpenters. The third vision was the putting of the measuring line upon Jerusalem. And the fourth vision showed Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel of the Lord. Who is the angel of the Lord? While Joshua was standing before the angel, Satan was standing by him. And the angel of the Lord acted to change the clothing of Joshua, because Joshua&#8217;s clothing, the basis for Satan&#8217;s accusation, was so dirty. Then he told Joshua that he would bring forth a stone, and this stone, with seven eyes, is the branch. What does all this mean? The fifth vision showed a golden lampstand with seven lamps and seven pipes full of oil. The sixth vision concerned a flying roll. How strange this is! After the flying roll, there was the measuring pot, which was called the ephah. And the eighth vision was concerning four chariots. What was Zechariah talking about? It is much easier to understand an earthquake coming to Los Angeles!<p>Brothers and sisters, we must see that this mystery is the mystery of Christ. In the recovery of the Lord&#8217;s house today, we do not need the prophets like Haggai so much. Yet today, nearly all the prophets are like Haggai. Have you heard some prophecy about Christ as God&#8217;s mystery? This is the problem today. There are too many Haggais, and hardly any Zechariahs. Haggai only opens the way for the prophecy, and Zechariah follows. In the recovery of the local churches, we need more prophecies like Zechariah, more prophecies about Christ. Today we rarely hear the voice of Zechariah, because it is mysterious; it is something which is not according to human concept. We need the heavenly vision to see the things concerning Christ related to the recovery of the building of God&#8217;s house.<h2 class=head1>THE MAN ON THE RED HORSE</h2><p>Who is the man riding on the red horse among the myrtle trees? It is Christ. The myrtle trees are the people of Israel, and at this time they were really in the bottom, for they were in captivity. Babylon is never on top, but always in the bottom. Do you like to live and work in the bottom? Why do you love Babylon so much? We should all come back to Jerusalem. You may think that Babylon is good, but you must realize that Jerusalem is on top and Babylon is in the bottom.<p>In the past years, when those working in the denominations came to talk with us, they always sounded as if they were low. They were in the bottom. Even they themselves sensed that they were not on top. When we come back to the local churches, we are on top, regardless of how much others oppose us. Even when they say we are wrong, we can sense in their speech that they know we are on top and they are in the bottom.<p>Myrtle trees are not grand trees like the cedars or pines, but small trees which grow in the bottom. This is the people of Israel in their captivity. They were in the bottom; yet praise the Lord! the Lord Jesus was with them. But how was He among them? Many times people ask us, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think if we have Christ, that is enough? Don&#8217;t you think that Christ is among us?&#8221; Yes, Christ is among those in the bottom, but for what purpose? To bring them out of the bottom! No human words can express what mercy and love the Lord has toward those in captivity. He is even among the believers who are still in the Catholic Church. But do you think that Christ is with them that they may remain there? No, He is with them to bring them out. He is not sleeping there, but riding on to bring them out. He has no intention to settle-Catholicism is not His settlement. That is the bottom. The denominations and the free groups are not His settlements. They are also the bottom. Christ is there, but Christ is riding through there. He is not a myrtle tree planted at the bottom. You may be planted there, but He is not. He is riding on! This is quite meaningful.<p>He is riding on a red horse! This signifies sacrifice and redemption. And He prayed for the captivity: &#8220;O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?&#8221; (Zech. 1:12). Christ prayed for the people who were in the bottom. This is the desire of Christ expressed in His intercession for those in the captivity. And God answered, &#8220;I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a line shall be stretched upon Jerusalem&#8221; (Zech. 1:16). I have the full assurance that the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is due to Christ&#8217;s intercession. He is interceding for those who are still in the bottom.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUR HORNS</h2><p>In the second vision, God raised up four horns and four carpenters to work out the situation for the captives to return. I do believe that today we still have the four horns. Twenty years ago, I never dreamed that there could be a local church in Los Angeles. Many know that I had no intention of coming to this country. But the Lord worked out the situation. Christ was interceding for the captivity, and the Father answered by causing the king of Persia to send the captives back to Jerusalem. He was one of the horns. The horns are the powers in the situation who accomplish something so that the people can return to Jerusalem. Christ interceded for the return of the captivity, and the Father answered by raising up the horns to make the return possible. I believe that the same thing is being done today.<h2 class=head1>THE SENDER AND THE SENT ONE</h2><p>In the third vision, a measuring line was put upon Jerusalem so that once more it might be possessed by the Lord. To measure something means to take it. The Lord is going to take over Jerusalem. This signifies that today the Lord is going to take over the local churches. Hallelujah! The measuring line has been put upon the United States!<p>In this vision we see that the Lord is both the Sender and the Sent One. &#8220;For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye&#8221; (Zech. 2:8). If we read the entire context, we see that the Sender and the Sent One are identical. The Lord of Hosts is the Sender, and the Lord of Hosts is also the Sent One. Christ is the Sender, and He is also the Sent One. Christ today is not only the life in the recovery of the local churches, He is also the Sender and the Sent One. He sent Himself to come into the situation to work out everything so that the local churches might be recovered.<h2 class=head1>THE BRANCH</h2><p>The fourth vision shows Joshua, representing the priesthood, standing before the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him (Zech. 3:1). The problem was that Joshua still had the dirty clothing from Babylon. We must never come back to Jerusalem with the old things. All the old concepts, old ways, old teachings, and old opinions must be discarded. If we look at ourselves, we see how old we are. We have come back, but what about our clothing? As long as we are still in the oldness, we are under the accusation of the enemy. Our position is right, but our condition is wrong. We have come out of Babylon, but Babylon has not come out of us. So many things of Christianity are still within us. We need a change not only in position, but also in condition. The old clothing must be taken away, and we must put on new garments. Christ is our new clothing. We must drop all the old things from Babylon; all the forms, teachings, concepts, opinions, etc., from Christianity must be taken away. We need something new, and this newness is Christ. Christ must be our covering and our clothing.<p>In some places the Lord&#8217;s people have taken the ground of the church, but they have still kept the old teachings and old ways. Thus, there has been ground for the enemy to accuse. We must change our clothing and take away all the old things so that we can put on something new of Christ. And we need not only the clothing, but also the mitre, the crown. Christ must be our clothing, and He must be our crown.<p>It was after this that Joshua was in a position to bring forth the branch, which is also Christ as the producing One. In the recovery of the local churches, we need Christ as the branch to produce. We need the growth of life, and we need the fruit-bearing by the branch. This branch is also the stone. The branch is for producing, and the stone is for building. The local churches can be built up only by Christ as the branch and the stone. This stone is the foundation with seven eyes. We have seen in the book of Revelation that the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God. This is the sevenfold, intensified Spirit for the recovery of God&#8217;s building. This vision is so clear. We need the clothing of Christ to be in a position to bring forth Christ as the producing One as well as the foundation stone with the intensified Spirit for the recovery of the building.<h2 class=head1>THE LAMPSTAND</h2><p>Following this is the vision of the lampstand. After Christ as the producing branch and the foundation stone with the seven Spirits, there is the lampstand. It is at this time that the declaration is made: &#8220;Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts&#8221; (Zech. 4:6). It is by the seven Spirits of the foundation stone. And He is not only the foundation stone, but also the headstone. This is the topstone which is used to cover the whole house. Christ is the foundation stone, and He is also the topstone. He is the foundation for the building of the local churches, and He is also the topstone of the local churches.<h2 class=head1>THE FLYING ROLL</h2><p>The sixth vision is that of the flying roll, which clears up the situation among the people. There were some evil things among the people, and this vision was given for the purpose of dealing with these things.<p>After this is the vision of the ephah, telling us that there were still many Babylonian things among the returned captives. The Lord says that these Babylonian things must be returned to Babylon. These two visions show that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery all the sinful things must be cleared up, and everything of Babylon must be sent back. Let the Babylonian things be returned to Babylon. All the things of Christianity belong there; they do not belong in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Anything we bring with us must be sent back.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUR CHARIOTS</h2><p>The eighth vision, the vision of the four chariots, is something of judgment. The Lord will judge the entire situation.<p>We do not need to see all of these visions in detail, but we must see Christ as everything. He is the branch, the producing One. He is the foundation stone and the topstone for God&#8217;s building. Now He is the King on the throne, and He is also the Priest. He has the kingship and also the priesthood. Upon Him these two ministries are united. So He is the One to build up the temple of God. He is the branch; He is the King; He is the Priest; therefore, He is the Builder. This is why we need Christ as the branch to produce, we need Christ as the King for the headship and the kingship, and we need Christ as the Priest for the priesthood that He might be the real Builder to build up the local churches.<p>The vision of Christ in Zechariah is related to the recovery of God&#8217;s building. He is the One riding on a red horse among the captivity and interceding for their return. He is the branch, the foundation stone, the topstone, the King for the kingship, and the Priest for the priesthood. And now He is the Builder. So we must enjoy and experience Him as the branch to produce life, and we must experience Him as the King for the kingship and the Priest for the priesthood. Then we will be in the recovery of the building of the Lord&#8217;s house. This is Christ seen in all the visions in the recovery of the building of the house of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FIRST AND SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Zech. 9-14</h1><p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery there are three ministries: the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood. We have seen that in the prophethood there are two kinds of prophets. One is represented by Haggai, and the other by Zechariah. Haggai helped the people to be strong to work, while mentioning a little about Christ as the Desire of all nations. Zechariah followed to tell the people the mystery of Christ. The ministry of the prophet Zechariah is a ministry concerning Christ, showing that in God&#8217;s recovery, Christ must have the first place. In the books of the recovery-Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah- eventually there is nothing but Christ. The recovery is the recovery of the building of God&#8217;s house, but it is for Christ.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE FUTURE</h2><p>The first section of Zechariah shows us quite clearly that Christ is everything in God&#8217;s recovery. But Zechariah not only prophesies concerning Christ in the present, but also about Christ in the future. The last six chapters are occupied with this. These six chapters may be divided into two subsections, chapters nine through eleven and chapters twelve through fourteen. In the first subsection, Zechariah prophesied concerning Christ as the anointed King, Who was rejected by the people. Of course, this relates to the Lord&#8217;s first coming. He came first as God&#8217;s anointed, yet He was rejected. In the last subsection, the rejected King is welcomed as the King. This is the second coming of Christ. So Zechariah prophesied something concerning the first and second coming of Christ.<p>The church today in the recovery of the Lord must stand for these two comings of Christ. We must tell others how Christ came the first time and how Christ will come the second time. We must not only tell that Christ has first place in God&#8217;s recovery, but that He has two comings, the first and the second.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST REJECTED BY MAN</h2><p>How did Christ come the first time, and how will He come the second time? This is shown clearly in the last section of Zechariah. Zechariah is a short, but deep book. It is easier to understand Isaiah than Zechariah. It is easy to understand Isaiah 53, but not so easy to understand Zechariah 9-11. &#8220;And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock&#8221; (Zech. 11:7). Who is this? Of course, at that time it was Zechariah; but if we read on, we will see that it is Christ. Christ was sold for thirty pieces of silver-this is mentioned in Matthew 26:14-16; 27:3-10. So it is Christ Who feeds the flock. This is why He said that He was the good Shepherd in the tenth chapter of John.<p>Then Zechariah 11:7 continues: &#8220;And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.&#8221; It is better to translate the word &#8220;Beauty&#8221; into &#8220;grace.&#8221; &#8220;And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us... full of grace&#8221; (John 1:14). Also, the word &#8220;Bands&#8221; should be translated into &#8220;unity.&#8221; Christ came with grace and unity. These are His two staves as our divine Shepherd. When He feeds us, we enjoy the grace; then we have the unity; we are just one.<p>&#8220;Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me&#8221; (Zech. 11:8). If we read Matthew 16:21, we see that these three shepherds are the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes. These were the three kinds of shepherds among the people of God when the Lord Jesus came to the earth the first time. He came as the Shepherd to feed God&#8217;s flock with grace so that they might have unity. But these three shepherds opposed Him; so the Lord cut them off. &#8220;And my soul loathed them, and their soul abhorred me.&#8221; All the elders, chief priests, and scribes abhorred the Lord because He cut them off. They were not the shepherds, but the thieves! And the people followed them to abhor the Lord; so He says, &#8220;I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another&#8221; (Zech. 11:9). This was really fulfilled after the death and resurrection of Christ. The Jewish race began to destroy one another.<p>&#8220;And I took my staff, even Beauty [grace], and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord. And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prized at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord&#8221; (Zech. 11:10-13). According to Exodus 21:32, a slave was priced at thirty pieces of silver. Christ was priced as a slave, and Judas betrayed Him for this price. The Lord came as the Shepherd, but He was rejected, betrayed, and sold as a slave for thirty pieces of silver.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST SMITTEN BY GOD</h2><p>We need to read Zechariah 13:7: &#8220;Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.&#8221; This is the Word of God, speaking about a man that is His fellow. He is a man, yet He is the fellow, the companion of the Lord of hosts. He is a man, but He is equal to God as God&#8217;s fellow. This is how the Lord Jesus came as a man. He came the first time as a man to be the Shepherd with grace and unity. But He was rejected, abhorred, betrayed, and priced and sold for thirty pieces of silver, just like a slave. However, not only did men reject and betray Him, but God smote Him. &#8220;Smite the shepherd.&#8221; He was smitten by God on the cross. He was betrayed for thirty pieces of silver by men, but following that, He was smitten on the cross by God Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF THE RECOVERY</h2><p>From all these verses we can see that Isaiah is much easier to understand than Zechariah. Everything in Zechariah is mostly hidden, because it is something in the recovery. Anything in the recovery is hidden and is a mystery to all who are not in the recovery. This is why people cannot understand us. They are always trying to understand, but they can never understand. Until you come into the recovery, that is, the local churches, you can never understand; there is always something hidden. It has been the experience of all who have come in, that at first they were not so clear. Even after two or three months, they still were not so clear. But after two or three years, everything was so clear!<p>This is why it is easy for the enemy to spread so many rumors. Satan knows that the local churches are the only ones that can cause him trouble; so he spreads many rumors through those who do not understand. Before the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan, the Canaanites talked much about them. Why? It was simply because they were fearful. Today it is the same. We are so little, but there is much talk about us across the country. Everything in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is a secret. Unless you are in it for a good while, you will still have some misunderstandings. You need to be in it for two or three years. Then you will be clear. Everything in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is mysterious. This is why the prophecies in Zechariah are given in a secret way. But praise the Lord, they are open to the local churches!<p>Zechariah tells us that Christ came as a man to be the Shepherd to feed the flock of God so that we could enjoy the grace and have the unity. Yet He was abhorred by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and therefore betrayed and sold for the price of a slave. Even God smote Him for the purpose of redemption, and when He was smitten of God, the sheep were scattered. The Lord quoted these words in Matthew 26:31. Peter was telling the Lord how he would follow Him to the end, and the Lord said it is written that God will smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.<h2 class=head1>AN OPENED FOUNTAIN</h2><p>Zechariah even speaks about the cross in a mysterious way. &#8220;And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends&#8221; (Zech. 13:6). This is truly a secret way to speak about the cross. The Lord came to the house of His friends, yet they wounded Him, and the wounds are visible in His hands. This means that His hands were nailed to the cross. The American Standard Version says that He was wounded between His two arms. This was the piercing of His side. Both are right. You may say this was the wound on His hands, or you may also say that this was the wound between His two arms.<p>Zechariah 13:1 gives us the purpose for which He was wounded: &#8220;In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.&#8221; This fountain is the flow of His precious blood from His hands and His side, the fountain for sin. Zechariah 12:10 says, &#8220;And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced.&#8221;<p>Zechariah prophesied concerning the death of the Lord in a very mysterious way. He did not use the word cross or crucifixion, but such words as wounded, a fountain opened, and whom they have pierced. In the whole Bible, there is not another book which gives such a wonderful and lovable picture of Christ&#8217;s death.<p>Zechariah also prophesied regarding the manner in which Christ would come to Jerusalem before His death. He came as a King, not upon a grand horse, but on a little colt, the foal of an ass. &#8220;Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass&#8221; (Zech. 9:9). This was fulfilled in Matthew 21:1-11, when the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem the last time.<p>I do not think that we could get a clearer and better picture concerning the first coming of the Lord than that which Zechariah gives us. He told us that He came as a man; yet He is the fellow of God. He came to be the Shepherd to feed the flock of God with grace for unity; yet He was abhorred by the false shepherds. He was betrayed for thirty pieces of silver and even smitten by God. He was wounded in His hands and side in the house of His friends so that He might open a fountain for the cleansing of sins. He came to them as a man to shepherd, and as a King, lowly, riding upon an ass; yet He was rejected. All this concerns His first coming, and it is prophesied in such a secret way. He puts a little piece here and a little piece there, and it takes a real revelation from the Lord to put them all together.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S SECOND COMING</h2><p>Zechariah also speaks of the Lord&#8217;s second coming. &#8220;Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee....Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley, and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee&#8221; (Zech. 14:1, 3-5).<p>These verses tell us that He will come with all the saints to fight, and He will stand upon the Mount of Olives. If we read Acts 1:9-12, we see that the Lord Jesus ascended from the Mount of Olives, and the angels told the disciples that He will come back in the same way. He left from the Mount of Olives, and He will come back to the Mount of Olives. He will return to the very spot from which He ascended. At that time, the Jewish people will be surrounded by their enemies, just as they were at the side of the Red Sea. As the Lord cleft the Red Sea, in the future He will cleave the Mount of Olives into two parts, making an opening for the people to flee from their enemies.<p>While the Lord Christ will be fighting for the people of Israel, God will pour upon them the Spirit of grace and all of them will repent and mourn. They will not mourn for their sins, but for their rejection of the Lord in the past. All the Hebrews will then repent and receive Him as Savior. He will solve all the problems on earth and be the King over all the nations. &#8220;And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one&#8221; (Zech. 14:9).<p>We all must be clear in the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the local churches that we are for Christ&#8217;s first coming, and we are also for His second coming. So we do need to pray-read the book of Zechariah. We do not need to analyze much, but simply pray-read. The Spirit of grace will help us to understand Christ more and more in a secret way. This is the Christ that we see prophesied in Zechariah, the mysterious Christ for the local churches, deeper than the Christ prophesied in Isaiah.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ENRICHMENT, STRENGTHENING, PURIFICATION, AND PROTECTION OF GOD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Ezra 7, 8, 9; Neh. 1-2</h1><p>According to the books of the recovery, the history is like this: First, the return of the captivity was begun. In the return, there were two leaders: the governor, Zerubbabel, representing the kingship, and the high priest, Joshua, representing the priesthood. Zerubbabel and Joshua returned with people to recover the temple. Ezra arrived more than fifty years later with a group of returned captives to enrich the recovery. Ten or eleven years after Ezra came, Nehemiah came to build up the city and protect the temple. Between Zerubbabel and Ezra&#8217;s time, the recovery of the temple ceased for about fifteen years, and Haggai and Zechariah were raised up to encourage the people to continue the work.<h2 class=head1>SIX NAMES</h2><p>Throughout this history of the recovery, six names stand out: Zerubbabel, Joshua, Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra, and Nehemiah. Zerubbabel was the governor of the province of Judah, representing the kingship, and Joshua was the high priest, representing the priesthood. It was under these two ministries that the recovery of God was begun. But the ministry of the prophethood was also required, and this came through Haggai and Zechariah. Haggai was used to stir up the spirit of the people to continue the work on the building of the temple. He told them that if they would finish the building, they would bring in the Desire of nations, who is Christ. Zechariah followed Haggai to tell the recovered ones more about Christ. This is really the proper prophecy. It must start with stirring up the spirit of the people, and it must end with Christ. The stirring up of the spirit of the people only requires two chapters, while all the things of Christ require fourteen chapters. The book of Zechariah is really wonderful; he mentions so much about Christ in God&#8217;s recovery. He is the branch to produce, and He is the foundation stone with seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, so prevailing for the recovery of God&#8217;s building, and He is the topstone with the full grace of God. He is the King with the kingship, the Priest with the priesthood, and eventually the Builder. This is Christ in God&#8217;s recovery as found in the book of Zechariah. Even today in God&#8217;s recovery, we need such a prophecy to recover all the aspects of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED OF EZRA</h2><p>But Ezra was still needed to enrich and strengthen the recovery. By the time Ezra returned, everything was recovered, but there was the need of strengthening and enrichment. The remnant of the people who returned was still small; the number needed to be increased, so Ezra brought back a good number. Today, we really need more Ezras. The number we have today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is still too small; we need some Ezras to come back from Babylon to strengthen the recovery in number. So many priests, princes, Levites, singers, and porters are still there in Babylon. They must be for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. They may have been born in Babylon, but they were not born for Babylon. They were saved in the denominations, but they were not saved for the denominations; they were saved for the Lord and His recovery. We must pray that the Lord will raise up some Ezras. We need more Ezras today. Ezra strengthened the recovery by bringing with him a good number of returned captives.<p>Today in Los Angeles, many things have been recovered, yet still the number is too small. How many thousands of the Lord&#8217;s people there must be in this city, and we have less than 1,000. If we compare it with all the Lord&#8217;s children in this city, we are still a small number. Yes, we have returned, but the returned number is still too small. We need to pray that the Lord will raise up some Ezras to bring back a larger number. On one hand we are satisfied, but on the other hand we are not. We need more Ezras to come back.<h2 class=head1>THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2><p>When we read the book of Ezra, we see that he did not say much about himself. He only mentioned that in a certain year, Ezra, who was the son of the priest, came back. We are not told how he was raised up, but we know that it was the Lord&#8217;s doing. The Lord raised up an Ezra to strengthen and enrich His recovery. So Ezra gave us a record of the silver, the gold, the vessels, and the basins which he brought back to the temple of God. This is not a small thing, for these are the riches of Christ returned from the captivity.<p>Sometimes people ask, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that in the denominations there is something of the Lord?&#8221; I tell them that even in the Roman Catholic Church there are many things of the Lord. There is much silver, much gold, and many vessels in Babylon, but these things should not remain in Babylon. They must be brought back to Jerusalem. All the things of Christ must be recovered from Babylon. In the denominations there is considerable work of the Lord, yet all the people of God and all the works of the Lord are not for the denominations; they are for the local churches. All the children of Israel in Babylon, even those born there, were not for Babylon, but for Jerusalem. All the work the Lord accomplished in Babylon was not for Babylon, but for Jerusalem. We must pray that an increasing number of the Lord&#8217;s children will be brought back to the local churches. And we must pray that all the experiences of Christ will be returned to the local churches. All the silver, all the gold, and all the vessels belong to the temple in Jerusalem.<p>I have never criticized the gospel work of anyone, for I realize that many have brought people to the Lord. In a sense, I like to hear of works that are so prevailing for the Lord. But on the other hand, I am not really happy until I see all these works brought into the local churches.<p>Ezra was one who brought many people into the recovery to strengthen it and many vessels of gold and silver to enrich it. The recovery today needs to be strengthened with numbers and enriched with the riches of Christ. To have the silver and gold is good, but to have it in Babylon is wrong. When the silver and gold are brought back to the house of God at Jerusalem, it is not only good, but also right. I like to see people pray-reading, but I am not so happy to see them pray-reading in the denominations. Not long ago, the Stream Publishers received a letter from a pastor telling how he appreciated the pray-reading. He asked us to send him many copies of The Stream in order that all the members of his church could learn to pray-read. I was happy, but in a sense I was not so happy, because that was something in the denominations. I am happy that people enjoy pray-reading, but I am not happy that the silver and gold remain in Babylon. It is not so good, but it is better than nothing; so we sent them all the copies to help them get the silver and gold. But all this must be brought back to the local churches. How we need the Ezras today to strengthen the numbers and to enrich the recovery with the silver and gold from Babylon.<h2 class=head1>A PRIESTLY SCRIBE</h2><p>Ezra was a priest, a descendant of Aaron, and he was also a scribe. The scribe in the Old Testament equals the teacher in the New Testament. But there is a difference between the prophet and the scribe or teacher. The prophet is one who speaks directly from God, and the teacher is one who teaches the things spoken by the prophet. We know, for example, that Moses was a prophet, because he spoke something directly of God. But a scribe is a teacher who teaches the things spoken by Moses.<p>Haggai and Zechariah were prophets because they spoke directly from God. What was spoken by Haggai was new; it was never revealed to anyone else. Zechariah&#8217;s message is even more marvelous. He said that Christ is the branch, the foundation stone with seven eyes, and the topstone. Did Moses say this? No, Zechariah was the first to say it. Zechariah was not a teacher, but a prophet, speaking from God&#8217;s instant, present, up-to-date inspiration. Ezra spoke nothing new. What he spoke had been already spoken by Moses. He was a scribe and a teacher. But according to the principle in God&#8217;s recovery, we do not need an old teacher, but a priestly teacher. Ezra was also a priest.<p>A priest is one who is mingled with the Lord, saturated with the Lord, feeding upon the Lord, and breathing Him in all day long. Whatever he speaks is just the Lord Himself. This is exactly what the teachers in the Lord&#8217;s recovery must be. Ezra was this kind of person. He proclaimed a fast, and he fasted; he was simply one with the Lord by contacting the Lord continually. He was not a letter-scribe, but a priestly scribe.<p>In the local church, we are afraid of objective teachers. Some people have a certain amount of knowledge, and they like to teach what they know, but they themselves are not that kind of person. The Lord&#8217;s recovery today does not need this kind of teacher. We need Ezra, the priestly scribe, the priestly teacher. This is the teacher who contacts God constantly and instantly, who is saturated with God and one with God. Ezra was very much with the Lord. He was in a position to ask the king for an army to protect him while returning to Jerusalem, but he did not do it. He put his trust in the Lord. This is the kind of person who is qualified to be a teacher in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Even if you have the physical means to help you, you must not take it. You must put your trust in the Lord. We do not need objective teachers in the recovery of the Lord&#8217;s building. Just the knowledge of the teachings will not help. We need the life; we need the priesthood to be mingled with the teaching. We need the priestly scribes like Ezra. Mere knowledge does not build; it kills. It is the priestly teacher who builds. This is the kind of person who can strengthen the recovery with an increase of numbers and enrich it with the rich experiences of Christ. Praise the Lord there are such Ezras, and I have full assurance the Lord is going to bring in more and more Ezras-those who are one with God, saturated with God, filled with God, and skillful in the work of God. These persons are the right ones to bring in a good number of returned captives and to bring more riches of Christ into the recovery of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>PURIFICATION</h2><p>Ezra not only strengthened and enriched the recovery, he also purified it. Before he arrived, there was a mixture. Some of the Israelites had married heathen wives and children were born of this mixture. This is a type which we should not apply literally, but spiritually. The recovery is the holy seed. Anything we receive which is not holy is a mixture. In some places where there were recoveries in the past, a mixture existed. The recovery is holy, but some of the things taken in are not so holy. Therefore, there is a mixture, and Ezras are needed to purify. Ezra was the one who purified the recovery. In the local churches we must be so pure, so simple, with no mixture. The problem is that many of us who have come back from Babylon have brought our background with us. Our background creates the mixture. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, there is the need of purification to separate the holy seed from anything that is heathen. Do not bring into the local churches the things that you did in the denominations, no matter how good they are. That is the bringing in of heathen wives. This does not mean that we are proud, but that we must let go of our background. We all must learn to give up the things of our background, regardless of how good they are. We must be so pure that the holy seed will never be mingled with anything heathen.<p>When the recovery is holy, we will see the Lord&#8217;s blessing. In some places, the reason the blessing was frustrated was the mixture caused by the background. We have been condemned many times for not inviting others to speak in our meetings. We are not proud, but we are really careful. If we invite outside speakers to come, they will bring in &#8220;heathen wives.&#8221; In the past we tried this, but it only caused trouble. So we have learned the lesson. This does not mean that we are narrow, but that the recovery is so pure, so single, and so holy. We do need the Ezras to do a purifying work. The Lord does not like any kind of mixture. In the Lord&#8217;s creation, everything was &#8220;after its kind.&#8221; If it is an apple, it must be from an apple tree; if it is a peach, it must be from a peach tree. We must be simple and after our kind. We need to be pure, strict, simple, and after our kind! If we are the denominations, we should just be the denominations. If we are the free groups, we should just be the free groups. We should not say that we are anything else. If we are the local church, we should just be the local church. We must be so simple, so single, so pure, and so genuine after our kind. We must be absolute. The Lord never honors any kind of a mixture. It must be after its kind.<p>Ezra&#8217;s work was to strengthen, enrich, and purify. He not only purified the people after the building up of the temple, but he purified them again for the building up of the city. In both Ezra and Nehemiah, there was the purification: one was after the building of the temple, and the other was after the building up of the city. In all the steps of the Lord&#8217;s recovery, there is the need of purification.<h2 class=head1>THE PROTECTION OF THE CITY</h2><p>We have seen the work of Zerubbabel, Joshua, Haggai, Zechariah, and Ezra. Is not this good enough? There is the return, the recovery of the building, the strengthening, the enriching, and the purifying. This is good, but it is not sufficient. There is still the need of the work of Nehemiah for the protection. There is the temple, but not the city. The temple needs the protection of the city. The temple is the house, and the city is the kingdom. The house of God needs the kingdom of God as the protection. So after Ezra, there is the need of Nehemiah. Nehemiah eventually became the governor of Judah. The kingship must be brought in for the kingdom.<p>We have seen these six persons: Zerubbabel, Joshua, Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra, and Nehemiah. Zerubbabel represents the kingship, and Joshua the priesthood. Haggai and Zechariah represent the prophets-Haggai to stir up and Zechariah to reveal Christ. Ezra is the priestly scribe to strengthen, enrich, and purify. Nehemiah came in for the protection, which is the submission to divine authority. In the local churches, we must have the house of God, and we must also have the city of God, which is the kingdom. The house of God depends mostly upon the priesthood-to contact the Lord, to be saturated with the Lord, and to be one with the Lord. This is the start of the recovery, but there is still the need of the headship, the kingdom, and the divine authority. The church is for the kingdom-that is, the house is for the city. Eventually the house of God becomes the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2-3). In the New Jerusalem, there is no temple (Rev. 21:22), because the temple has been enlarged into the city. This means that the city and the temple are mingled as one. This is the eternal protection. Simply to have the house is not adequately safe. We need the protection of the kingdom. This is the ministry of Nehemiah, the last governor in the recovery. The first was Zerubbabel, and the last was Nehemiah.<p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, there is the need of these six persons. One by one they all contributed something which was necessary and vital. I love these recovery books. They have exactly the things that we need today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We need Zerubbabel; we need Joshua; we need Haggai; we need Zechariah; we need Ezra; and we need Nehemiah. Nehemiah brings in the protection of the city. As long as we do not have the city, we are not safe. We need a certain kind of protection as the outskirts of the house of God. The city is just the outskirts of the temple. With this there is the protection to the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Eventually the house, the temple, will be mingled with the city in the New Jerusalem, providing protection for eternity!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CITY AS THE ENLARGEMENT OF GOD&#8217;S HOUSE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Neh. 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13</h1><p>After recovering the building of the temple, there is still the need to build up the city. Without the city, there is no protection for the temple. The temple is complete; it is the place of the Lord&#8217;s presence, where we meet and serve the Lord; but it needs protection. The wall of the city is the defense to the temple. Without the wall of the city, there is no protection.<p>This is a type which we must apply in the New Testament. In the New Testament, the building of the church is first mentioned in the Gospels. After Peter declared that Christ was the Son of God, he was told that the church would be built. The church comes after the knowing of Christ; after we experience Christ, the church comes into existence. At the same time the Lord told Peter that He would give him the keys of the kingdom. Therefore, the kingdom follows the church. These three things are necessary: Christ as the rock, the church, and the kingdom. Christ must be experienced, the church must be built up, and then the kingdom will be brought in.<p>In the Epistles, the church is the house of God-this is mentioned in both Ephesians 2:19 and 1 Timothy 3:15. But in the last two chapters of Revelation, there is a city. And in that city there is no temple (Rev. 21:22), because the city has become the enlargement of the temple. We know what Christ is, and in a sense we all know what the church is, but not many are familiar with the city.<h2 class=head1>THE INCREASE AND ENLARGEMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is the divine and eternal center. When He comes into me, into you, and into so many others, there is the increase of Christ. This increase of Christ is the church (John 3:29-30). Christ increased, Christ enlarged, is the church. What is the church? The church is the enlargement of Christ and the increase of Christ. We all are parts of Christ and members of Christ. My hand is a member of me and a part of me; even my little toe is a part of me because it is a member. Regardless of how small you are, as long as you are born of Christ, you are a part of Christ.<p>Sometimes people ask me what kind of Christian I am. What they really want to know is whether I am a Methodist, Presbyterian, or Baptist. The best way to answer is to say that I am a part of Christ. That is the kind of Christian I am. I am not part of a Presbyterian group, but part of Christ. We are all parts of Christ, and all of these parts put together are the increase of Christ. We are all parts of the Body, the fullness of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). If we look at a certain brother, we see a bit of Christ. All the bits and parts added together become His fullness which is His Body.<p>The church is the fullness of Christ, because Christ has been increased and enlarged into so many members. But what is the city? The city is a further enlargement of Christ. The first step of the enlargement of Christ is the church as the house. The second step of this enlargement is also the church, not as the house, but as the city. The church as the house must be enlarged to be the church as the city. The city is something larger and safer than the house. Eventually, the whole house becomes the city! Revelation 21:22 says that there is no more temple in the city because the temple has become the city. The city is the tabernacle, the dwelling place (Rev. 21:2-3). The city is the enlargement of the temple, the development of the house to the uttermost.<h2 class=head1>THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2><p>The building of the house and the city is the center of God&#8217;s eternal purpose. This building is simply the mingling of God with man. When Christ comes into us, that is the mingling. Christ mingles Himself with us. Therefore, the church is a mingling of divinity with humanity, a divine mingling of God with man. When this mingling is enlarged and consummated to the fullest extent, that is the city. So the city eventually becomes the mutual building, the mutual habitation, of God and man. God dwells in us, and we in God. Oh, this is really marvelous! This is the universal, eternal mingling of God with man. We are His dwelling place, and He is ours. On a small scale, this is the house, and on a large scale, this is the city.<p>The Bible from the first page to the last takes this as the central theme. I have mentioned before that the Bible is like a painting of a tiger with thousands of items in the background. The main figure in the painting is the tiger. It is not a painting of a mountain, a bridge, or some trees; it is a painting of a tiger. All these other things simply constitute the background. The Bible is a painting of the mingling of God with man. There are thousands of other items, but they are simply the background; they mean little. The main figure is the divine mingling. The mingling is of four figures: The first is God, the second is Christ, the third is the church, and the fourth and final is the local churches. These are the main figures of this biblical painting. It is the mingling of God with man. If we have the revelation of this mingling, the whole Bible will become transparent from the first page to the last. Otherwise, it is veiled to us.<h2 class=head1>LIFE AND HEADSHIP FOR THE HOUSE AND THE CITY</h2><p>What is Christ? Christ is the divine life. And who is Christ? Christ is the very God. Christ is nothing less than God. And Christ as God is our life. Christ is life to us, and He has been wrought into us that we may enjoy Him as life. This is indeed wonderful! Christ as life is so wonderful! No one can tell the wonder and joy of this life. Life is everything, and Christ is the life to us. There is no human utterance to define Christ as our life. Life is a mystery; no one can describe it, yet it is everything to us. If we do not have Christ as life, everything is vain. Christ as life is so much to us. Hallelujah!<p>Christ as life is signified by the church as the house. I realize that so many of us have partaken of the enjoyment of Christ as our life. But Christ is not only this much, He is more. The New Testament first tells us that Christ is our life, but eventually it says that Christ is our Head and we are His Body. The Body needs the Head, and the Head needs the Body. Christ is not only our life, but He is also our Head. If we only experience Christ as life, yet do not realize Him much as our Head, we only have the church as the house. There is not the city yet. When we realize that Christ is not only our life, but also our Head, then Christ will have the second step of enlargement. Then the church will not only be the house, but also the city. The house is mainly with the life, and the city is mainly with the Head.<p>In the last two chapters of the Bible, there is a city with a throne. Out of the throne proceeds the river of life with the tree of life growing on either side. Out of the throne proceeds life! There is the throne, and there is life. We know what the life is, but what is the throne? This is the headship, the authority, the kingship, and the lordship of Christ. It is easy for us to realize Christ as life, but it is not so easy for us to realize Christ as the Head. The enjoyment of Christ as life is comparatively easy to experience, but to realize the headship of Christ is not so easy. There are some who know a little of Christ as life, but they know nothing of the headship of Christ. The New Testament tells us clearly that Christ is both our life and our Head. The Gospel of John speaks of Christ as life, and the Epistles, especially Colossians, tell us that Christ is also our Head. He is not only our life, but also our Head.<p>We must keep in mind that Christ is these two main items to us: our life and our Head. When we realize and enjoy Christ as our life, we have the church as the house. But if we go further and realize His headship, the church will be enlarged to the city. Then the church will be safeguarded. It is much easier to capture a house than to take over a city. It is easy to break into a house, but it is not easy to get through the walls of the city. The city is the safeguard of the house.<p>We are all enjoying Christ now as life. And many are having a local church honeymoon. But we all know that a honeymoon cannot last forever. Now everyone feels so happy, but sooner or later this honeymoon will be over. Then you will not feel so happy with some of the brothers, and the local church will not be such a joyful place to you. It is at this time that we need Christ not only as our life, but also as our Head. We need not only the enjoyment, but also the headship. If we realize the headship of Christ, then the wall of the city will be built up.<p>In many of the local churches, there is the real enjoyment of life in the house, but as far as the city is concerned, there are still some breaches in the wall. They still do not have the safeguard. This is why after Zerubbabel, Joshua, and Ezra, there is the need of Nehemiah for the building up of the wall of the city. The enemy hates this even more than the building of the temple. The adversaries did try to hinder, frustrate, and damage the building of the house, but not nearly as much as they opposed with their subtle wiles the building of the city. The enemy knows that the building of the house can be destroyed, but once the building of the city is completed, there is the safeguard of the wall as a defense to protect the house. So what we need for the long run is the building up of the wall. The wall is part of the city which is the safeguard to the house.<p>It is good for all the young brothers and sisters to experience Christ as life. But they must go on to experience Christ as their Head. He must not only be our life, but also our Head; not only our enjoyment, but also our authority. We should not only be in the enjoyment of life, but also under the authority of the headship. Why are there so many divorces in America today? Simply because people want the enjoyment of marriage without recognizing the headship. If a couple feels happy, they enjoy marriage, but when they feel unhappy with each other, they get a divorce. If they realized that they are not only in the marriage life, but also under the headship, there would be no divorce. Brothers and sisters, under the headship, we have no choice! We are under the divine authority. We must all see the life and the headship. Then we will not only have a house, but also a city with a strong and high wall.<p>If I have realized the headship of my Lord, whether I am happy with the other saints or not, I am simply one with them; I have no choice. I am not only in His life, but also under His headship. I see the headship, and I am under it. The real building of the city is to help all the brothers and sisters to realize the headship of Christ.<p>In the church if we are only in the life of Christ, but know nothing of the headship of Christ, there may be breaches in the wall. We may build up the church as the house in the life of Christ, but to have the church as the city, we must realize the headship of Christ. To have a church not only as a house, but as a city for protection, we must go further to take the headship of Christ. Having the life of Christ may be sufficient for the house, but it is not sufficient for the city. The city must be built up with the headship of Christ.<p>We all need to have our will exercised, renewed, and transformed so that it will be under the headship of Christ. Our will must be subdued to the Head. Then we will be settled. As members of the Body, which is expressed by the local church, we must be willing to be under the headship of Christ. Then we will build up our part of the wall, and there will be no breach.<p>The book of Nehemiah tells us that each one must build up his part of the wall. I cannot build for you and you cannot build for me. Everyone must build up his own part. And with the building up of the wall, the work is mainly with the stronger ones because this is a matter of fighting. This is not a matter of the emotion, but a matter of the will. Whether I like it or not, I still must build the wall. Whether it is easy or hard, I still must do it. There is no choice. I must submit myself to the headship of Christ so that the wall can be built up.<p>All the local churches need the building up of the wall. If we have seen the local church as the expression of the Body, then we must see that the Body is under the headship of Christ. We as members are under this headship. There is no choice; we must all be under the authority of Christ. Then the wall will be built. The wall constitutes the city, and the city in typology signifies the kingdom, the government. The Lord is in the house, but the King is in the city for the kingdom.<h2 class=head1>THE SEPARATING WALL</h2><p>There is another point regarding the wall. The wall of a city is not only for protection, but also for separation. The wall is a separating line. When the wall is built up, it separates what is within from what is without. In Genesis 2, there was a garden without a wall, so it was so easy for the enemy, the creeping one, to creep in. Satan crept in because there was no wall. But at the end of the Bible, there is a city with a wall one hundred forty-four cubits high. That is twelve times twelve, the number of eternal perfection. There is a perfect wall to separate what is holy from what is common. Anything that is common has no entrance into the city.<p>The separation of the wall is not built up with regulations, but with transformed precious stones. The New Jerusalem is a city built up with transformed stones, not pieces of clay. There is not one brick made of clay. The separation of the wall is the building up of the transformed stones. The more we are transformed, the more we are separated, and the transformation eventually becomes the separating line. It is not by regulation, but by transformation. We should not have any regulations in the church concerning how long our hair ought to be or whether our members should shave or not. Today there is quite a discussion not only among Christians, but also among unbelievers about the length of the ladies&#8217; garments. Some are so devilishly and hellishly short. But should we make regulations about the length of our garments? No, if we were to have that kind of regulation, we would become a long-garment religion. Of course, this does not mean that we agree with the short dresses. But our trust is in the growth in life and transformation. Transformation is the separating line. We do not have regulations, but we do have the transforming life. Praise the Lord! This transforming life will bring forth much separation.<p>In the wall of the New Jerusalem, there is nothing of regulation, but there is the building of the transformed precious stones. If we would pray-read all the verses in Revelation 21 and 22, we would see so much related to life: the flow of life, the feeding on life, the drinking of life, and the transforming of life. This is the church with the wall built up by transformation.<p>This is why the enemy hates the building up of the wall. Until the wall is raised up in the local churches, there is no safety, safeguard, or defense. We need the building up of the wall-to have every man realize the headship of Christ. Everyone must keep his position for the building up of the wall and must learn how to work with one hand and fight with the other. Building is not an easy job; it can only be carried on by fighting.<h2 class=head1>THE SUBTLE WILES OF THE ADVERSARIES</h2><p>When we begin to build the wall, we will really see the subtle wiles and devices of the adversaries. First, they will pretend to be good to us. They will call a conference and say that we must meet together. This sounds good, but many, many times we will be cheated by this kind of proposal. Do not take it; this is not something of the Lord. I have learned that such conferences are useless. What can come out of such a conference? What can come out from these conferences for the Lord&#8217;s interest? You will find that these conferences are just snares set up by the enemy to deceive. We must learn the wisdom of Nehemiah. He told them that he was too busy working on the wall to attend their conference. But they made not just one, but four proposals! It is easy to reject the first, but it is not so easy to reject the second, the third, and the fourth. I am afraid that most of us would accept the fourth proposal.<p>In all the local churches we must learn the lesson to never engage in any conference with the adversaries. If we are in the Lord&#8217;s way, then let them take this way. If they do not think it is, then let them go their own way. There is no margin, no compromise, no conference. We simply do not have the time. If they are willing to take the Lord&#8217;s way, they will take it. Never accept the proposal to go down to meet with them. No, they must come up to take this way. We will never go down. Let them come up.<p>Oh, how subtle the adversaries are! Some of the returned ones even corresponded with them. The high priest was involved in a marriage relationship with them, and some of the priests even opened the temple of God so that the adversaries might dwell there! But when Nehemiah returned the last time and discovered that one of the adversaries was dwelling in a chamber of the temple, he kicked him out! Some might think that this was being too rough, but Nehemiah could pray, &#8220;Lord, remember what I have done for these people and for Thy house.&#8221; The Lord remembers. It is not a matter of what others say, but what the Lord remembers.<h2 class=head1>THE SECOND PURIFICATION</h2><p>After the building up of the wall, Ezra came in again to help the people to be purified once more. Ezra was a priestly teacher and gave the people priestly teaching to help them be purified. He read the Word of God to the people, and they were inspired. They all agreed to sign a covenant that they would give up all the strange mixtures. In the local churches, every bit of mixture must be excluded. We must be thoroughly purified from all mixture. Anything common and anything contradictory to the heavenly nature must be cast out. The Lord&#8217;s recovery must be pure. After the building up of the house, we need purification, and after the building up of the city, we need to be purified again. This purification was not only realized and carried out by Ezra, but also by Nehemiah. There are at least two purifications under Ezra and one under Nehemiah. We need the recovery of the wall, and we need the purification. This is the need today in all the local churches.</body></html>
