   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY OF MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: What is the significance of the angel contending for the body of Moses in Jude 9?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lee</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: This happened after the death and burial of Moses Deut 34:8, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Deuteronomy 34:6 seems to indicate that Moses was not in his sepulcher for long.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No other passage can be linked to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I myself believe that only the transfiguration on the Mount in Matthew 17 is related to this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, this is the only incident recorded after Moses' death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan wanted to stop Moses from putting on his body to appear on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, Michael contended with him, according to the nature of his work, which Daniel 12:1-2 shows has to do with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LIVING CREATURES AND THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Question: Do the living creatures in Revelation 4:6 represent all living creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who do the twenty-four elders represent?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why is the number twenty-four?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lee</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Answer: Yes, the four living creatures represent all living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The twenty-four elders are the kings and priests among the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their sitting on the throne and their crowns show that they are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their ministering by the incense altar in white garments shows that they are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Twenty-four is the number for the divisions of the priesthood 1 Chron 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>PRIOR TO THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Question: You have said that the rapture is the transformation and the taking up of the living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the two preachers are raptured after they are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Does that not mean that there will be a resurrection before the blowing of the seventh trumpet Rev 11:12 ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Answer: That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two preachers are special and have nothing to do with the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE RAPTURE AFTER THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Question: You have said that after the seventh trumpet, there will still be a minority of believers on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once they are ready, they will be raptured also.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the proof of this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Answer: The proof of this is in Revelation 11:18, which tells us that by that time there will still be Christians talking about the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In typology, there are the firstfruits, the harvest, and also the gleanings Lev 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SCROLL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Question: Some have said that the scroll mentioned in Revelation 5 signifies the grant deed of a redeemed inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This sounds plausible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lee</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Answer: Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we cannot say this so directly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will know what the scroll says when it is opened in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This scroll is the book of the God who pre-ordained history and who executes what He has ordained according to His wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not only a prophecy, but the fulfillment of prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The judgment of the world, the redemption of the world, and the ruling of Christ are all contained in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE LOCUSTS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Question: Are the things that will come out of the abyss in Revelation 9:1-11 what you have described in The Christian, Issue No. 1? Lee</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Answer: Yes, because ordinary locusts do not have kings Prov 30:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the locusts in verse 11 have kings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE FOUR MESSENGERS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Question: What does Revelation 9:14 refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lee</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Answer: Nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The river Euphrates is the boundary of the ancient Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It has to do with the revival of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE LITTLE SCROLL</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Question: Is the little scroll in Revelation 10 the same as the scroll in Revelation 5?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lee</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Answer: No. The scroll in chapter five is sealed, whereas the scroll in chapter ten is open.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moreover, the scroll in chapter ten is "little," whereas the scroll in chapter five is new.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, one can know it only when he unrolls it i.e., when he has the revelation .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The scroll in chapter ten is open already i.e., God has revealed it already .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All that it takes is to eat it and digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The scroll in chapter ten is the prophecies in the Old Testament.</S>
