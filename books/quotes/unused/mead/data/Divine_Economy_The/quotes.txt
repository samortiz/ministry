[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE DIVINE ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:9-10; 3:9-11, 2-6; 1 Cor 9:16-17; 1 Tim 1:3-4 GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE, WILL, AND PURPOSE
[3]  Although the divine economy is the central topic in the New Testament, it has not been touched that much among the Christians in past centuries.
[4]  If you trace the root of the word economy, it goes back to a word that refers to the parceling out of food, the distributing of food as in parcels.
[5]  It was hidden in God in eternity past and continued to be hidden in God for the first four thousand years of human history.
[6]  Now we need to ask why God created man in His own image, making man a copy of Himself, and why God created man with a spirit.
[7]  John 4:24 tells us that God is Spirit and that we must worship Him in spirit.
[8]  God created man in His own image, after His own likeness, with a spirit to worship Him and contact Him because of His divine economy.
[9]  When I was a young man, I did everything quickly.
[10]  After God created man in His image with a spirit to contain Him, God put this man in front of the tree of life and charged him to be careful not to eat the wrong tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:16-17 .
[11]  In the Gospel of John we see that the Lord is the vine tree John 15:1 and that He is the life John 14:6 .
[12]  IN GOD'S CREATION 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-14, 18-24; Psa 46:4-5; 36:8 THE IMAGE OF GOD, THE SPIRIT OF MAN,
[13]  John 6 shows us that Jesus is the bread of life v. 35 with the riches of life for us to eat v. 57 . Then John 7 tells us that whoever believes in Jesus and receives His life will have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being v. 38 . In John 6 is the bread of life with the riches of life, and in John 7 are the rivers flowing with living water.
[14]  We have already pointed out that bdellium is a pearl produced from the plant life and not from the animal life.
[15]  The shedding of the blood from the animal life is required for redemption, but with the plant life there is no thought of redemption.
[16]  Thus, bdellium signifies that the Son of God had to be a tree to be broken to secrete His life-juice to produce bdellium.
[17]  He is not only life but the bread of life so that we can eat Him.
[18]  The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life Gen 2:9 , which is also the life supply "good for food."
[19]  In Genesis 2 there was the tree of life, and in Revelation 22 there will be the vine tree, the tree of life.
[20]  IN THE SPIRIT AS THE RIVER Scripture Reading: Exo 17:6; Psa 46:4; 65:9a; 36:8; Ezek.
[21]  We have to understand the Bible, not merely according to the letter but according to the divine light, so we can see this marvelous picture of the tree of life with the river of life, which depicts that God is embodied and that God flows out and into us for the dispensing of Himself into our being.
[22]  In John 6 the Lord Jesus told people that He was the bread of life for people to eat vv.
[23]  The fountain of life is God the Father, the spring is the Son who is the embodiment of life, the embodiment of the fountain, and the Spirit is the flow of life as the river that reaches us.
[24]  Thus far we have covered three main items the divine economy, the embodiment of God, and the flow of God.
[25]  Jesus as the Son of God came in the name of the Father John 5:43a .
[26]  John 8:16 says, "But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me."
[27]  This is because He was in the Father, and the Father was in Him; the Father was always with Him, and He was there in the name of His Father as the embodiment of God.
[28]  The Son became incarnated and lived a human life in order that God could dispense Himself into His chosen people.
[29]  After Jesus was baptized, three things happened: the heavens were opened, the Spirit of God descended upon Him as a dove, and the Father spoke concerning the Son, "This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight" Matt 3:16-17 .
[30]  Furthermore, we saw that Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit and that this Holy Spirit as the divine element was the constituent of Jesus.
[31]  Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon Him, the Lord Jesus was born of the Spirit Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 , proving that He already had the Spirit of God within Him.
[32]  IN THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14a, 29; 3:14; 12:24, 28, 31-33; 19:34; Rom 8:3; 6:6; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 2:14; 9:26b, 28a, 14; Col 1:15, 20; Eph 2:15-16; Mark 15:25, 33-34; 1 John 1:7
[33]  He was the embodiment of the Triune God, the very embodiment of life as the tree of life for us to eat that God may dispense Himself into us, His eaters.
[34]  Now we need to see who it was that died on the cross.
[35]  We may realize that Jesus Christ as our Redeemer and Savior died on the cross, but we need to go deeper to realize that He died on the cross as the God-man.
[36]  John says that God became flesh John 1:1, 14 , but Romans 8:3 tells us that Jesus was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin.
[37]  The final item of Christ in His death on the cross is in John 12:24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
[38]  He died as the grain of life to release the divine life from within Him to dispense God into all of us as the divine life.
[39]  Four main items concerning Christ in His divine economy are His incarnation, His human living, His death, and His resurrection.
[40]  Not many see that Christ's resurrection is a life dispensing.
[41]  OUR BEING IN THE LORD AND IN THE FATHER,
[42]  When the Lord Jesus told the disciples He was going to die, they were disappointed.
[43]  When this God-man became thirty years old, He began His ministry.
[44]  The Spirit descended upon Him as a dove to empower Him for His ministry.
[45]  Then He died on the cross to clear up every negative thing in the universe so that He, as the embodiment of the Triune God, could dispense Himself into us.
[46]  In the evening of His resurrection He came back to His disciples, who were frightened of the persecuting Jews John 20:19 .
[47]  The disciples, who were under the threatening of death, had the door shut in the place in which they had gathered.
[48]  Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."
[49]  Today the Lord Jesus is no longer on the cross nor is He merely in the heavens, but He is right now in you and me in our spirit.
[50]  The Spirit of God was there in creation, the Spirit of Jehovah was there in God's contact with people, the Holy Spirit was there in Christ's conception and birth, but the Spirit of the glorified Jesus was not there until Jesus was glorified.
[51]  When people saw Him, they saw the Father v. 9 . In John 14:16-20 the Lord went on further to reveal that He and the Spirit also are one.
[52]  After He revealed that He and the Father are one, He told the disciples in verse 16 that He would ask the Father and that the Father would give the disciples another Comforter that He might be with them forever.
[53]  This Comforter is "the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you" v. 17 . We know the Spirit of reality because He abides in us.
[54]  John 14:26 says, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name..."
[55]  The Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name.
[56]  After the Lord's talk with the disciples recorded in John 14 16 and His prayer in John 17, He went to Gethsemane and was arrested there in the same night.
[57]  In His glorification, that is, in His resurrection, Jesus as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.
[58]  Before the glorification of Jesus, the Spirit of God was merely the divine Spirit, but in the glorification of Jesus, in His resurrection, many crucial things were added into the Spirit of God.
[59]  The first four books of the New Testament are on the Son with the Father by the Spirit, but the next twenty-two books are on the Spirit, who is the compound of the Triune God, of the proper man, of the proper human living, of the death of Christ, and of the resurrection of Christ.
[60]  IN THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 20:22; Rom 8:2, 10, 6b, 11; 2 Cor 3:6b, 17-18; Rev 1:4-5; 4:5; 5:6 THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION
[61]  God is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit for God's dispensing, so that God can dispense Himself into man.
[62]  The Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of God.
[63]  THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT GIVING US LIFE FOR OUR
[64]  This Spirit is the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit.
[65]  He is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 who gives life 2 Cor 3:6 , so He is the life-giving Spirit.
[66]  In this life-giving of the Spirit, God dispenses Himself into all His believers.
[67]  Second Corinthians 3:6 tells us that the Spirit gives life, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 tells us that the Lord is the Spirit.
[68]  M. R. Vincent, who is noted for his word studies in the New Testament, says, "The Lord Christ of verse 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers v. 6 ." Andrew Murray, in his book The Spirit of Christ, tells us that the Spirit is the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the God-man.
[69]  In some Christian weddings the pastor charges the man to love his wife and charges the woman to submit herself to her new husband.
[70]  Although the husband and wife agree to do this, shortly after the wedding both of them may realize that they cannot do this.
[71]  Instead of exhorting the husband to love the wife, and the wife to submit herself to her husband, it would be wonderful if the person marrying them would tell them: "Both of you need to realize that the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God is in you.
[72]  In the book of Revelation are the seven Spirits 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .
[73]  There is only one Spirit Eph 4:4 , but in Revelation the one Spirit of God has become seven Spirits.
[74]  Essentially God the Spirit is one, but in function He is seven.
[75]  But by the time we pass through the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles and come to Revelation, the Spirit is now the sevenfold Spirit who is the consummation of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, the Holy Spirit, and the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit.
[76]  Some teach that the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, is only a power, a means, or an instrument for God to do something.
[77]  This all-inclusive Spirit is the compound of all that the Father is and has and all that the Father can do, is doing, and will do, plus the Son in His person and with His work, His accomplishments, His attainments, His obtainments, and with all the processes He has gone through.
[78]  The blessing of the gospel, the blessing of the New Testament, which God promised to Abraham is this compound Spirit, the totality of God the Father, of God the Son, together with the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[79]  The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is realized as the all-inclusive Spirit, so this all-inclusive Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God with all His attributes, all His virtues, and all the processes He has gone through.
[80]  Paul tells us in Romans 8:4 that we need to walk according to spirit.
[81]  When the indwelling Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit who is Christ Himself, occupies you and makes His home in your heart, filling you with Himself, you will crucify your flesh Gal 5:24 and put to death the practices of your lustful body Rom 8:13 .
[82]  When we live Christ by walking according to the indwelling, all-inclusive Spirit, this Spirit gives life into our being, dispensing the Triune God as the all-inclusive life supply into us for us to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[83]  In the New Testament two aspects of the Spirit are revealed the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power.
[84]  The Spirit of life is within us, while the Spirit of power is outside of us.
[85]  The Spirit of life, not the Spirit of power, is the central line of the revelation concerning the Spirit.
[86]  Whether or not we have the Spirit of power, we are still living because we have the Spirit of life.
[87]  By this Spirit we have been regenerated to be the children of God, and by this Spirit of life we are the sons of God.
[88]  To receive the Spirit of life into you is the regeneration of the Spirit of life.
[89]  Regeneration is by the Spirit of life to regenerate us, to make us children and sons of God, but baptism is the putting of all the believers by the Lord as the Head into this one Spirit to make them all one Body.
[90]  So 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."
[91]  In the early 1900s Pentecostalism came to the United States and spread to the West Coast where a conference was held on Azusa Street in Los Angeles.
[92]  One was mild, saying that if you do not speak in tongues, you do not have the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[93]  First Corinthians 12:7-10 is concerning the manifestation of the Spirit, which is the issue of the essential and economical aspects of the Spirit.
[94]  Essentially, we received the Spirit of life as our essence.
[95]  Economically, the Spirit descended upon us to accomplish the baptism in the Spirit.
[96]  Many of those who "speak in tongues" know that the tongue they speak is not real, yet they still speak it.
[97]  In 1963 the writer of an article in a Pentecostal paper said that he checked with two hundred tongue-speakers, and every one of them doubted that the tongue they spoke was genuine.
[98]  Now we are in the church enjoying the Spirit, drinking of the Spirit, contacting the all-inclusive Spirit, and being transformed.
[99]  Among the Christians today there is much fighting and division.
[100]  All the saints may praise you and say that you are a good brother.
[101]  Yet you realize in the Lord's light of life that you are not that wonderful.
[102]  By the Lord's mercy, we have seen that in the book of Revelation there is the sevenfold Spirit for the testimony of Jesus.
[103]  The testimony of Jesus is the testimony of the Son coming with the Father by the Spirit to live on this earth for thirty-three and a half years and to die on the cross to clear up the universe, to release the divine life, and to resurrect from the dead to become a life-giving Spirit; the life-giving Spirit comes as the Son with the Father compounded with divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, including all the divine attributes and all the human virtues.
[104]  In every local church, time after time there are some burned out wicks.
[105]  Thus far, we have seen that the Bible unveils to us that God's economy is His household administration to dispense Himself into His chosen people that we may partake of His life and nature and become the members of Christ for the formation of His Body that God may express Himself through this Body for eternity.
[106]  Whenever Christ as the High Priest comes to snuff all the negative things and add more oil to the church, He is actually adding more and more of the sevenfold Spirit, which is to add more of the divine nature, more of the gold, into the church life.
[107]  The first three chapters of the book of Revelation are on the local churches as the golden lampstands, trimmed and dealt with by Christ the Head as the Priest.
[108]  Revelation 21 tells us that this city is a wife v. 9 . The New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb, the bride of the Lamb 21:2 . This indicates that the city is organic.
[109]  Revelation 21 also tells us that this city as the wife of the Lamb is God's tabernacle, God's dwelling place v. 3 . Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be a dwelling for both God and His serving ones.
[110]  To God the New Jerusalem is His dwelling, and to us God is our dwelling because Revelation tells us that in the New Jerusalem there is no temple, "for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb" 21:22 .
