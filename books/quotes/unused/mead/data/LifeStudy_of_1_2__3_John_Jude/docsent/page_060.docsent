   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A POLEMICAL SECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These sixteen verses are also very polemical.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses are the most polemical section of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already mentioned that John s writings are polemical, for he was fighting against heresies, including Gnosticism, Cerinthianism, and Docetism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These heresies were related to the Person of Christ, and they caused damage and confusion to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, it was necessary for the apostle John to be polemical and to fight against these heresies, inoculating the saints against the poison of the heresies concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these sixteen verses John gives a word regarding the deep truth of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But John s way of writing is based on the growth in life of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason, John classified the believers into three groups: children, young men, and fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>LITTLE CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 12 John refers to the recipients of this Epistle as little children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a general address and does not refer to any specific class of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have already mentioned, according to verse 1 of chapter two, the aged apostle considered all the recipients of his Epistle his dear little children in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We shall see that later in verses 13 through 27 John writes to the young children, young men, and fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But here he addresses all the believers as little children, no matter what their spiritual age may be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, all the believers are God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the other hand, in the church life God s children were also John s children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John considered the believers his children, not his students or his followers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be a student is a matter of knowledge, and to be a follower is a matter of participating in a certain activity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the word children indicates life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this Epistle John refers to the believers in a way that indicates life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John did not even say my dear children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, he used the more intimate expression little children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes an elderly parent will refer to his mature son as his child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, a man may be in his eighties and his son, in his sixties.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, the father may still refer to his son as his child.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a sign of a tender, intimate relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this Epistle, John, an elderly father, addresses all the believers as little children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Writing in an intimate manner, he says, I write to you, little children....</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This term of address also indicates that in writing these verses John is concerned with the believers growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 12 John says, I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The forgiveness of sins is the basic element of God s gospel Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31; 10:43; 13:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through this, the believers who receive Christ become the children of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John realized that forgiveness of sins is a basic factor in our becoming God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 12 John tells the little children that their sins have been forgiven because of the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have believed in this precious name and have received the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The forgiveness of sins is the first basic element in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we believe in the name of the Lord and call on His name, the first blessing we receive is the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through forgiveness, we have been justified and have become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regeneration, therefore, is based on the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason the apostle John regards forgiveness of sins as the basic factor in addressing the recipients of this Epistle as little children.</S>
