The book of Jeremiah has as its particular nature and standing God's tenderheartedness plus God's righteousness
According to this book, in the sight of God, all the nations, all the Gentiles, are animals, acting as if they do not have a human spirit
The second party is Jeremiah, a timid young man raised up by God to be His mouthpiece to speak for Him and express Him
In contrast, Israel, the third party, is evil and stubborn, and the fourth party, consisting of the nations, is even worse
Eventually, nearly all of the children of Israel were exiled, ending, in the sight of God, their history as God's elect
He spoke much concerning the history of Israel, he presented a full story of his life, and he uttered many prophecies
Although this covenant is good for the New Testament believers the Jews presently have no part in it because of their unbelief and rebellion
No matter how stubborn wicked and corrupt Israel Gods elect may be God will eventually make Christ the righteousness of Jehovah to them
Regarding this, God can be compared to a father who weeps as he disciplines his child because he loves the child
God carries out His economy not only by chastising Israel in love but also by judging the nations in righteousness
God's judgment upon the nations comes out of His love for them and results in His salvation of them in His love
The day will come when every one of Israel, great and small, will manifest Christ, having Christ as their centrality and their universality
When Antichrist is about to destroy the entire people of Israel, Christ will come down from the heavens to deliver them from Antichrist
Jeremiah 23:6 and 33:16 both reveal that Christ, the Shoot, the descendant of David, will be made the righteousness of Jehovah to Israel
Lamentations 32225 says It is Jehovahs lovingkindness that we are not consumed For His compassions do not fail They are new every morning
Immediately after speaking of God's lovingkindness and compassions, Jeremiah utters a personal word: 'Jehovah is my portion
In His days Judah will be saved And Israel will dwell securely And this is His name by which He will be called Jehovah our righteousness
At the time this word was written, David's descendants had become evil, and it seemed that no more kings would come out of David's tribe
Jeremiah prophesied that one day God would raise up a new sprout, a new branch, a righteous Shoot, to reign as King and act prudently
As Isaiah 53 indicates, the word regarding Christ's acting prudently refers to His acting wisely in His resurrection
According to Jeremiah 31:33, this divine law is not only put into our spirit but is also written, inscribed, on our hearts
Jeremiah 31:34 tells us that all the house of Israel will know Jehovah, from the little one to the great one among them
The third section concerns Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon the nations involved with God's elect, Israel
In a very real sense, the book of Jeremiah is a drama in which an important part is played by each of these four parties
In the foregoing message we emphasized the subject, the content, and the central thought of the book of Jeremiah
We should not understand the Bible in a natural way but according to the divine revelation regarding God's economy
Such an answer is good, but it is lacking in light and in vision and remains on the level of a mere Bible study
The best way to answer this question is to answer according to the revelation in the New Testament concerning God's economy
If we see this, we will know why it is necessary for Christ to be made the righteousness of Jehovah to God's people
According to the book of Jeremiah, Israel was wicked and provoked God's wrath, and because of this God came in to punish and chastise them
The subject of Jeremiah is Christ being made the righteousness of Jehovah to God's elect as their center and circumference
The divine life is given on the basis of Christ's redemption through God's justification, which is based on His righteousness
Apparently Jeremiah is a book concerned with Israel's sin and wickedness and with God's chastisement of Israel
It was written to show us that God wants to be increased, to be enlarged, in order to have a fullness for the expression of Himself
Since this is the subject and content of the entire Bible, why should the subject and content of Jeremiah be different?
The basic element of the divine word in Jeremiah is not Israel's sin and God's chastisement; the basic element is God's economy
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the entire Bible, including the book of Jeremiah, was written for God's economy
In Jeremiah 2:13 we have God's word to Israel, the elect of Jehovah, concerning two evils which they have committed
God's intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to satisfy His chosen people for their enjoyment
The goal of this enjoyment is to produce the church as God's increase, God's enlargement, to be God's fullness for His expression
God's economy is to dispense Himself as the living water to produce His increase, His enlargement, to be His expression
In John 7:38 He said, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
In Revelation 21 and 22 we have a vision of the New Jerusalem, which is a great sign of God's increase for His expression
In 1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4 Paul, using the Old Testament types, speaks not only of drinking but also of eating
Adam fell by forsaking the tree of life and turning to another tree the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
God was burdened that Israel would drink Him to become His increase as His fullness that they might express Him
Lamentations 32225 says It is Jehovahs lovingkindness that we are not consumed For His compassions do not fail They are new every morning
Because of His compassions, lovingkindness, and everlasting love, God would never give up His elect yet distracted people
We should not think that we are better than Israel, and we should not read the Bible for others but for ourselves
In the middle of Jeremiah's long and detailed account of Israel's wickedness , he tells us that Jehovah will raise up to David a new Shoot
In His days Judah will be saved And Israel will dwell securely And this is His name by which He will be called Jehovah our righteousness
Our heart is deceitful above all things and is incurable , and we have a sinful nature that can never be changed
In speaking of the new covenant that He would make with His elect, God said that He would put His law within them
God writes His law upon our hearts by moving from our spirit into our heart to inscribe what He is into our being
In verse 34 God says, 'All of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them'
As believers in Christ, we all, from the little one to the great one, have this capacity to know God by living Him
In the new covenant, which is the better covenant , God has put Himself into us as life, and this life is our inner law
It is of His lovingkindness that we are not consumed, and His compassions do not fail but are new every morning
God's purpose in wanting to be the fountain of living waters for His elect to drink is that He would be increased and enlarged
Verse 10 goes on to say, 'A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads'
Finally, in Revelation 22:1 we have a word concerning the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
God does not want to express Himself by Himself alone; rather, He wants to express Himself through His counterpart
Because God, the Husband, is divine, the wife, His counterpart, should also be divine that she might match Him
Just as Eve was the increase of Adam, being built from Adam's rib, so God's elect as the bride are the increase of Christ as the Bridegroom
We may understand what the Bible says and what this hymn says about God's faithfulness either in a natural way or in a spiritual way
In 1 Corinthians 1:9 Paul says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
We need to realize that in allowing us to have troubles, God is faithful in His purpose to turn us from idols and bring us back to Himself
God used the Babylonians to deal with these idols and also to destroy Jerusalem and even the temple, which had become an idol to them
After repenting, we should begin to drink of the living waters, praising God, giving thanks to Him for everything, and enjoying Him
It is Jehovah's lovingkindness that we are not consumed, / For His compassions do not fail; / They are new every morning
These words were written after the Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem, burned the temple, and carried away many into captivity
The princes, the prophets, and the priests had failed, but God's compassions do not fail; rather, they are new every morning
Jeremiah could even declare that Jehovah was his portion and that he hoped in Him, for He is good to those who wait on Him
At this point we need to see that Israel's failure opened the way for Christ to come in to be their righteousness
They may say, 'Lord, we do not have anything that God can recognize as righteousness, but You have come to be our righteousness'
If we are defeated, we will suffer punishment in the millennium, but eventually we will be matured and enter into the New Jerusalem
Some Christians may love the world today, but sooner or later God will come in to take away the 'toy' of the world, and they will repent
Every believer, whether presently weak or strong, will be in the New Jerusalem, and everyone there will be mature
Many of the saints in the Lord's recovery today offer such an excuse for not functioning in the church meetings
God does not regard as legitimate the excuse that we do not know how to speak or the excuse that we are too young
Moses had warned Israel that if they did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God, they would be cursed in every way
Why was it necessary for God to make Jeremiah into a fortified city, into an iron pillar, and into brass walls?
The kings, the princes, the priests, and the people of the land were enemies not only to Jeremiah but also to God
The Bible tells us that on earth there is always a battle raging between God and those who oppose Him and fight against Him
In the Lord's recovery today, we also face opposition, condemnation, and rejection, and we also must fight for God
In this message on Israel's sin against Jehovah and Jehovah's punishment of Israel, we will consider these two evils of Israel
In the book of Jeremiah, Jehovah God considers Himself a husband to His beloved elect, Israel, and Israel a wife to Him
There was a bridal day, a wedding day, for Jehovah and Israel, and Jehovah, the Husband, still remembered that day of love
Thus says Jehovah What iniquity did your fathers find in Me That they have gone far away from Me And have walked after vanity And are vain
Israel walked after vanity, and they themselves became vain; they worshipped idols and as a result they made themselves nothing
The shepherds, the rulers, transgressed against Jehovah, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, that is, in the name of Baal, an idol
Finally, in forsaking Jehovah, the fountain of living waters, God's people were like Jehovah's wife committing fornication with many lovers
Israel realized that Jehovah was her Husband, but she continued to commit fornication with many lovers, with many idols
We may labor to get something for ourselves, but then our 'cistern' develops a crack, and we lose whatever we have gained
They worshipped and served not only the things of God's creation but also the things of their own creation idols of wood, stone, and metal
As the wife of Jehovah, Israel forsook her chastity to commit fornication, having a harlot's forehead and refusing to be ashamed
In this matter, they were different from the virgin, who could not forget her ornaments, or the bride, who could not forget her attire
It is said, / If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man's wife, / Will he return to her again?
Israel had been divided into two kingdoms: the north was called the kingdom of Israel, and the south, the kingdom of Judah
In spite of all this, the treacherous southern kingdom of Judah did not return to Jehovah with all her heart, but instead falsely
In verse 11 Jehovah said to Jeremiah that Israel the apostate has shown herself to be more righteous than Judah the treacherous
Being a Husband to Israel, Jehovah promised to take them, one from a city and two from a family, and bring them back to Zion
Israel was foolish and did not know anything, but these shepherds would give her the proper knowledge and understanding of God
Such Christians have made the Bible something separate from God, when actually the Bible should be one with God
Today is a time of degradation but a time will come when Christ the embodiment of God will be with us and we will have no need for the Bible
When Israel is revived, no one will care for the ark because Christ will be present with Israel and reign in Jerusalem
The Bible also reveals that we were created by God to be His creatures but that, as believers, we were regenerated by God to be His sons
She left her Husband and went to many lovers, all of whom were her Husband's enemies, yet her Husband begged her to come back to Him
When she does return, she is not able to repent to Him as His wife, so she considers Him not as her Husband but as her Father
As a woman acts treacherously by departing from her husband, so the house of Israel dealt treacherously with Jehovah
Her children wept and supplicated on the bare heights, for they perverted their way and forgot Jehovah their God
He has gone forth from his place / To make your land a waste; / Your cities will be ruins, / Without an inhabitant'
The heart of the king and of the princes will fail; the priests will be appalled, and the prophets will be astounded
According to verse 16b, besiegers are coming from a distant land, giving out their voice against the cities of Judah
Although she dresses in scarlet, is adorned with ornaments of gold, and enlarges her eyes with paint, she beautifies herself in vain
Israel's cry will be like that of a woman in travail, and her anguish like that of a woman bringing forth her first child
Her voice will gasp for breath, and she will stretch out her hands, saying, 'Woe is me, / For my soul is fainting before murderers'
Chapter five of Jeremiah is Jehovah the Husband's further complaint against Israel the wife's wickednesses in detail
He knew the Ten Commandments, and he wrote about the wickedness and sinfulness of Israel according to the sequence of the Ten Commandments
In the law there are not only the Ten Commandments but also many ordinances, regulations of God's just and righteous law
For wicked men are found among My people; / They lie in wait like fowlers crouching; / They set a trap, / They catch men'
They did not judge in a just way the cases of ordinary people; neither did they treat the orphans justly and rightly
The prophets prophesy falsely, / And the priests rule by their own authority; / And My people love it this way'
The enemy will thoroughly glean her remnant like a vine; they will pass their hand again over her branches like a grape gatherer
The houses of Israel will be turned over to others fields and wives together and the Husband will stretch out His hand over her inhabitants
The Babylonians would harvest the 'grapes' from the 'vine' of Israel, and then come again to glean the vine thoroughly
God sent Moses to release them from this yoke and tyranny and bring them out of Egypt into the wilderness to Mount Sinai
At Mount Sinai the heavens were opened to Israel, and God gave them the revelation concerning the tabernacle and its utensils
As they were traveling in the wilderness, they began to degrade from the revelation they had received from God through Moses
When the people of Israel were about to enter the good land, Moses repeated the divine revelation; he repeated the revelation of God's law
Because Israel spared the idol worshippers, there was war again and again between Israel and the people in the land
After the period of the judges David who was brought in by Samuel fought all the inhabitants of the land and gained nearly the entire land
Following the design which his father received from God, Solomon, David's son, built the temple in approximately 1000 B
They had forsaken God, the fountain of living waters, and, hewing out broken cisterns, they had turned to idols and were worshipping them
Even the king was greedy, for, as we will see, he commanded the people to build him a palace but did not pay them for their labor
Before the time of Jeremiah, Isaiah prophesied against Israel, saying that Israel had become like Sodom and Gomorrah
Jehovah went on to say that He would make Jeremiah into a fortified city into an iron pillar and into walls of brass against the whole land
As Jeremiah went forth to fulfill God's commission, he spoke to the king, the princes, the priests, and to the people
Jeremiah told the king that he was sinful and that if he did not repent and return to God, he would be taken captive
He exposed the prophets for prophesying falsely and the priests for ruling by their own authority and not by the divine revelation
They had given up everything concerning God and His revelation, and eventually they came to be in a dark night
When God chastised Israel, He regarded Himself as the Husband and Israel as the wife who had fallen into fornication
For this reason, in chapters two through six God's tone in rebuking Israel is that of a husband speaking to an unfaithful wife
After doing such things, they would come and stand before Jehovah in the house which is called by His name and say, 'We are delivered'!
Jehovah charged the prophet Jeremiah not to pray for them and not to intercede with Him, for He would not hear him
It is hard to believe that God's elect, His chosen people, could degrade to such an extent that they would make cakes for the wife of Nimrod
These birds knew the time of their coming and going, but Israel was not knowledgeable concerning the times of God's intention
The wise men are put to shame They are dismayed and are taken Behold they have rejected the word of Jehovah And what wisdom do they have
In 7:12-14 Jehovah says that He will do to the house that is called by His name, in which Israel trusts, as He has done to Shiloh
These bones will not be gathered up or buried; rather, they will be left like dung on the surface of the ground
Death will be chosen rather than life by the remnant of her evil family that remains in all the places where Jehovah has driven them
The corpses of men will fall like dung on the surface of the field and like a sheaf after the reaper and there will be no one to gather them
Jehovah will shame every goldsmith by his idol and will punish the molten image of falsehood for such images are vanity the work of delusion
A great commotion is coming from the north land to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a habitation of jackals
Jehovah came in to correct His hypocritical worshippers, and Jeremiah reacted to Jehovah's correction of Israel
In verse 21 he says that the shepherds, who are stupid, have not sought Jehovah and therefore have not prospered
Jehovah said that for the mountains He would take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness, a lamentation
He would do this because they had been burned up so that no one passed through, and the sound of cattle was not heard
In these verses the words us and our indicate that Jehovah joined Himself to the suffering people and was one with them in their suffering
In Jeremiah 10:6 the prophet declares that there is none like Jehovah; He is great, and His name is great in might
In verse 7 he continues saying For it befits You For among all the wise of the nations And in all their kingdoms There is none like You
The vision of the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the Bible, which has one thousand one hundred eighty-nine chapters
All the books of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, are related in some way to the New Jerusalem as God's goal
Because the Bible speaks of so many other things, in our reading of the Word we may easily be distracted and not see God's goal
By all these different means, He reveals His thought concerning the New Jerusalem and depicts the various aspects of the New Jerusalem
God's aim in His economy is to have a group of human beings who have His life and nature inwardly and His image and likeness outwardly
Immediately after the first mention of the tree of life, we are told that 'a river went out of Eden to water the garden'
It is significant that the last chapter of the Bible also speaks of the tree of life and the river of water of life
What God desires of man is that man would eat of Him as the tree of life and drink of Him as the water of life
Through our eating and drinking of Him, God is able to dispense Himself into us as our life and our life supply
They did not realize, however, that by hewing out cisterns they were turning to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
After God presented His purpose to man, man did not accept God and His purpose but instead began to do things according to himself
By using the law to present a picture of Himself, God was indicating that He wanted His people to become His duplication
Among His degraded elect who had been sent into exile, God had His overcomers such as Daniel and his companions
In fulfilling God's economy, Christ is first our righteousness and then our redemption and our all-inclusive inner life
As a result, Israel too will be constituted with God and become one with God in life, nature, image, and appearance
Like Israel, we once had a 'bridal day' , a time when we pledged our love to the Lord and told Him that we loved Him to the uttermost
Many believers have left their first love and have become degraded according to the pattern presented in Revelation 2 and 3
Eventually we will all be submissive to the Lord and recognize that we are evil; we will confess that we are a totality of sin
We will realize that along with the divine life with its sense, law, and capacity, we also have the divine nature
Some may find it hard to believe that this revelation concerning God's economy with His dispensing can be found in the book of Jeremiah
We should be reminded that Jeremiah speaks of God's being the fountain of living waters and of Christ's being our righteousness
As such an abstract, this book is a picture showing us that we are nothing and that Christ is everything to us
Rather, according to God's economy with His dispensing, we will take Christ as our life, our life supply, and our everything
We have already covered this matter somewhat, but here Jeremiah gives us a fuller picture of the breaking of the covenant
The covenant of Jehovah with Israel was made in the day that Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt to Mount Sinai
The covenant of Jehovah with Israel called the first covenant and also the old covenant was the covenant of the law of the Ten Commandments
The commandment concerning honoring our parents is ranked with the first four commandments concerning God and His Sabbath
Through the trial of keeping the commandments of the law, our nature, situation, and condition are exposed and become clear to us
The covenant of promise given to Abraham and the covenant of grace given to the New Testament believers are the same covenant
The sinful nature of the people of Israel cannot be changed, just as a Cushite cannot change his skin or the leopard its spots
Since Israel's heart was deceitful and incurable and their nature was sinful, it was impossible for them to keep the law
Through their total failure in keeping the law, Israel was also to come to know that they needed Christ to be Jehovah as their righteousness
Chapters eleven through thirteen of Jeremiah speak both of Israel's breaking of the covenant of the law and of God's punishment over them
Jeremiah 12:15 reveals that eventually God will return to them and have compassion on them and bring them back from their captivity
Finally, in 13:17 we see Jeremiah the prophet's reaction to Israel's breaking of the covenant and to God's punishment over Israel
Deuteronomy 2823 refers to this curse by saying Your heaven which is above your head will be brass and the land which is under you iron
It is He who gives 'the early rain and the late rain, in its season' and who 'preserves the appointed weeks of the harvest'
As a curse for Israel's breaking of Jehovah's covenant, 'the showers have been withheld, / And there has been no later rain'
In 14:1-6 we have Jehovah's message through Jeremiah the prophet to the punished Israel concerning their drought
On the one hand, God punished them; on the other hand, God was still sympathetic, and the prophet was one with Him in being sympathetic
Verse 22 continues, 'Are there among the vanities of the nations any that can bring rain, / Or in the heavens any that can give showers?
Jehovah said to Jeremiah, 'Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me, My soul would not turn toward this people
In this message we will begin to consider Jehovah's further commission to Jeremiah and His further statement of Judah's sins
Your wealth and your treasures/I will give as plunder without price,/And that for all your sins,/And within all your borders
Because Jeremiah was a part of this entity, when the wealth and treasures of Israel were given to their enemies, Jeremiah also became poor
God's word was addressed to Jeremiah, but in speaking to Jeremiah He included the children of Israel together with Jeremiah
According to the entire revelation in the Holy Bible, God's words are good for us to eat, and we need to eat them
It seems that God spoke in one way according to His feeling and that Jeremiah responded in a different way according to his feeling
Jeremiah had been hurt, wounded, and he made his complaint to God, asking Him if He would be like a deceitful brook or like waters that fail
We may also say that Jeremiah, who was quite disappointed, also needed to return to God in order to be restored by Him
God went on to tell Jeremiah that if he brought out, that is, uttered, the precious things from the worthless, he would be as His mouth
Jehovah's word concerning uttering precious things may indicate that He regarded Jeremiah's speaking in the previous verses as worthless
They would fight against him, but they would not prevail against him, for Jehovah would be with him to save him and deliver him
He also promised that He would deliver Jeremiah from the hand of the wicked and redeem him from the grasp of those who terrorize
Concerning feasting, Jehovah said to Jeremiah, 'You shall not enter the house of feasting to sit with them and eat and drink
In this message we will continue to consider Jehovah's further commission to Jeremiah and His further statement of Judah's sins
He would even send 'fishermen' to catch them and 'hunters' to hunt for them in order to gather them and restore them
Concerning the blessing of trusting in Jehovah, verses 7 and 8 say, 'Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah / And whose trust Jehovah is
These verses can be understood in two different ways according to the natural understanding and according to God's economy
According to God's economy, the one who trusts in God is like a tree planted by water, signifying God as the fountain of living waters
The thought here is the same as that in 1 Corinthians 3:6, where Paul says, 'I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth'
The supply is the riches of the supplying God dispensed into us as the plants so that we may grow into God's measure
Eventually, the plants and God, God and the plants, are one, having the same element, essence, constitution, and appearance
Jeremiah 17:7 and 8 are not concerned merely with such a shallow matter as trusting in God to receive material blessings
We all need to see the crucial significance of absorbing God as the living water that we may be constituted with His element and essence
Jeremiah 17:9-11 is concerned with the deceitful and incurable heart of man and with the searching, test, and reward of Jehovah
I Jehovah search the heart And test the inward parts Even to give to each one according to his ways According to the fruit of his doings
Even this word regarding the deceitful and incurable heart of man is related to God's economy with His dispensing
Jeremiah began his prayer by saying, 'A throne of glory set on high from the beginning / Is the place of our sanctuary
They were told to sanctify the Sabbath day, as Jehovah had commanded their fathers, who did not listen to Him or incline their ear
The Sabbath signifies that God has done everything, completed everything, and prepared everything and that man must stop all his work
Of working in such a way, we should take in God as our enjoyment, drinking of Him as the fountain of living waters
The New Testament also is mainly of these two aspects: to receive God as the living water for our enjoyment and to stop our work
God has accomplished everything, and He is ready for us to enter into His eternal enjoyment in the New Jerusalem
In chapters fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen of Jeremiah we have a full picture of God's economy by His dispensing
The book of Jeremiah reveals that God surely judges the evil ones, and sometimes He uses certain evil ones to judge other evil ones
God was intending to judge the people of Israel, and He sent Jeremiah to tell them that He would use the Babylonians to punish them
Jehovah answered with a further commission to Jeremiah and also by placing restrictions on Jeremiah for His further commission
In this record of Jeremiah's speaking to Jehovah and Jehovah's speaking to Jeremiah, we see some crucial aspects of God's economy
Through the word as our food, God is dispensing His riches into our inner being to nourish us that we may be constituted with His element
As He dispenses Himself into us as water God is supplying us with the rich element of His being that we may be constituted with His divinity
God's intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to His chosen people for their enjoyment
God desires to be the fountain of living waters for us to drink that our thirst may be quenched and that we may be satisfied
As God accomplishes His economy by dispensing Himself into us, He is our food, our water, and our fountain of living waters
The significance of keeping the Sabbath ordained by God is to take this fountain of living waters as our enjoyment, rest, and satisfaction
There is no need for us to do anything; we should simply be satisfied with all that God has done and accomplished
In His days Judah will be saved And Israel will dwell securely And this is His name by which He will be called Jehovah our righteousness
Jehovah our righteousness refers to Christ in His divinity, and a righteous Shoot refers to Christ in His humanity
From Jeremiah's word in 15:10 17:27, we can see that there was something within him that was different from God's thought regarding Israel
God did not give Jeremiah's mother an opportunity to respond but came in to speak with Jeremiah and even to argue with him
Jeremiah saw that the potter was working and reworking the pottery at his wheel into another vessel, as it seemed good for him to make
Israel did not return and amend her ways but walked after her own devices and did according to the stubbornness of her evil heart
She had been a virgin betrothed to Jehovah, but she forsook Him, the reality as her fiance, and turned to idols, which are vanity
In the Lord's recovery today, we are taking the upward way, the ancient paths, which the apostle Paul and the other apostles took
Because of their evil condition, Israel made their land an astonishment, a thing to be hissed at, to be despised, forever
They contended with him and dug a pit for his life, having hidden snares for his feet and having made counsel against him for his death
In 19:1-13 God showed Jeremiah that Israel was as a potter's earthenware jar which had been spoiled and needed to be broken
The breaking of Israel as a potter's earthenware jar was illustrated in the valley of the son of Hinnom at the entrance of the potsherd gate
He would make Jerusalem an astonishment and a hissing, and make her eat the flesh of her sons, daughters, and neighbors
They struck him put him in the stocks mocked him reproached him derided him defamed him and terrified him by denouncing and entrapping him
Jeremiah was assured that Jehovah was with him like a mighty one who terrifies and that his persecutors would stumble and not prevail
Sing to Jehovah; / Praise Jehovah; / For He has delivered the soul of the poor / From the hand of the evildoers'
Cursed be the man who brought good news / To my father, saying, / A male child has been born to you, / Causing him much joy'
These chapters are concerned with Jehovah's condemnation of and punishment upon the kings and prophets of Judah
According to 22:9, the kings of Judah with their people forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God and worshipped other gods and served them
They had eyes and a heart only for their unjust gain, for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression and doing violence
Jehovah pronounced woe to the kings of Judah as shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of Jehovah's pasture
If he had used this word, verse 5 would have been indicating merely that Christ is a human being born as a descendant of David
The birth of Christ as such a Shoot was wholly a matter of life, and His birth was rich in its implications regarding life
At the time of Christ's coming nearly two thousand years ago, the tree of the royal house of David was merely a stump in the ground
Christ was conceived in Mary, not through Joseph as the father but through the Holy Spirit , to be something divine and holy
While they were there, Mary gave birth to Jesus and laid Him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn
In His days Judah will be saved And Israel will dwell securely And this is His name by which He will be called Jehovah our righteousness
Jeremiah prophesied that Christ would come as a Shoot who is Jehovah Himself to be the righteousness of God's chosen people
He had to shed His blood to wash away their sins and accomplish redemption, for without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness
God's people are justified by standing on the redemption of Christ and receiving Christ as God to be their righteousness
With Him we have the life-giving Spirit and the riches of life, including the element of life, the law of life, and the sense of life
In this message we will consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the son of David and the son of Abraham
The New Testament opens with the words, 'The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham'
If we know the New Testament as a whole, we will realize that the entire New Testament is wrapped up with these titles
In His divinity, Christ is the 'Root of David,' his source; in His humanity, He is the 'Offspring of David,' his issue
The titles son of David and son of Abraham are not simply for us to know the revelation concerning Christ's person
The authority to bind and to loose is given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church in 16:19, but also to the church itself
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
God made man in His own image and after His likeness so that man could contain God, taking God as his life and life supply
The created race, the race of Adam, was a failure, so God came to another race, the chosen race, the race of Abraham
God made a covenant with Abraham, and this covenant concerns God's being the enjoyment and everything to His chosen people
In this fulfillment, the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit is the blessing to God's chosen people
In the gospel, we have received the all-inclusive Spirit as God's consummation to be the life, life supply, and everything for our enjoyment
As a result of the covenant God made with Abraham, the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit has become our enjoyment
Christ had to be the son of Abraham to fulfill God's covenant with Abraham so that God, after being processed, could be our blessing
God must have a kingdom, a realm, a sphere, on earth with His chosen race to exercise His administration under His full, divine authority
In this administration He can come in to exercise whatever is on His heart to be the blessing promised to His chosen people
The reason for this is that there is the need of a kingdom a realm a sphere for God to exercise Himself to give us His allinclusive being
Even in John, the gospel of life, we are told that if we are not regenerated, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God
There is the need of a kingdom so that God can exercise Himself to dispense Himself into us as our life blessing
In Matthew we have the King-Savior; in Mark, the Slave-Savior; in Luke, the Man-Savior; and in John, the God-Savior
If we do not repent and receive the Lord as the King-Savior, we cannot have Him as the Slave-Savior, the Man-Savior, and the God-Savior
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we must receive Christ first as the son of David and then as the son of Abraham
To receive Christ as the son of David is to recognize His kingly status and to realize that we should be under His kingship and sovereignty
If we have Christ as the son of David, the greater Solomon, we will also have Him as the son of Abraham, the real Isaac
Matthew 28:19 speaks of the believers' being baptized into the Triune God into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit
As long as we have the son of David and the son of Abraham, we have the Triune God, and we are in the Triune God
In this message we will continue to consider Jehovah's condemnation of and punishment upon the kings and prophets of Judah
In 23:9-40 we have a word regarding Jehovah's condemnation of and punishment upon the prophets of Judah with the priests and with the people
In these verses we first see Jehovah's condemnation of the prophets of Judah with the priests and with the people
In the prophets of Jerusalem Jehovah saw a horrible thing: the committing of adultery and walking in falsehood
These prophets dared to prophesy falsely in Jehovah's name; they were 'prophets of the deceit of their own heart'
They prophesied false dreams to lead Jehovah's people astray by their lies and by their boasting, not rendering any profit to His people
In verse 28 Jehovah says The prophet who has a dream let him tell the dream and he with whom is My word let him speak My word faithfully
For the word to be grain means that it is food for our nourishment and that it contains the divine essence to be dispensed into our being
In verses 28 and 29 Jehovah compared His word to grain, to fire, and to a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces
Our heart may be like rock, but the word of God can break us in pieces so that Christ can be ministered to us as life-giving grain
Jeremiah 23 also shows us Jehovah's punishment upon the prophets of Judah with the priests and with the people
Jehovah's wrath will go forth like the storm wind, even a whirling tempest which will whirl down on the head of the wicked prophet
The anger of Jehovah will not turn back until it has executed and until it has accomplished the purposes of His heart
Jehovah will utterly forget them and cast away from His presence them and the city which He gave to them and to their fathers
In this message we will consider Jeremiah 24 26, a section concerning Judah's captivity and Judah's reaction to Jeremiah
We might think that Jehovah would have no regard for the exiles; however, here we are told that He would regard them for good
Because of God's judgment, they would be put in such a low condition that they would be mocked and derided by the nations
As we read the book of Jeremiah, we should keep in mind that this book was not written according to the historical sequence
Rather, Jeremiah, inspired by the Spirit, wrote a book that is a composition of history, prophecy, and autobiography
The word of this prophecy was given to Jeremiah in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah
When the people came to worship in the temple, Jeremiah was to take that as an opportunity to prophesy to them
Jeremiah advised the people of Judah, including the priests and the prophets, to listen to his word and to turn from their evil way
Otherwise, Jehovah would make the temple like Shiloh and the city of Jerusalem a curse to all the nations of the earth
Jeremiah answered and said that Jehovah had sent him to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words which they had heard
Hezekiah feared Jehovah and entreated His favor, and Jehovah repented of the evil which He had spoken against them
God was determined to judge and punish Israel, yet He still wanted Israel to listen to His word, repent, and return to Him
They persecuted Jeremiah and derided him, and it seemed to Jeremiah that there was no way for him to go on living
Although Jeremiah was preserved, because of the different opinions, nothing was attained toward the accomplishment of God's goal
Whether the people were for Jeremiah or against him, the opinions had the same result God's purpose was frustrated
God's intention is to be everything to His chosen people that they may trust in Him and rely on Him for everything
According to the spiritual scene, the unseen view, in the book of Jeremiah, there were demons behind the idols and also behind the ideas
My aim in this life-study is neither opinion nor teaching; my aim is to infuse you with God's economy by His dispensing
Rather, our heart must be touched by God's center, by the centrality and universality of Christ regarding God's economy
Jeremiah prophesied that Jehovah had given Israel and all the nations around her into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
They should all be under his yoke and serve him and his son and his son's son until the time of revenge upon his own land comes
They were demonic persons, not in the sense of being demon possessed but in the sense of having regular contact with demons
The false prophecy given by these prophets diviners dreamers soothsayers and sorcerers was that Israel would not serve the king of Babylon
Nebuchadnezzar had taken some of the vessels of the house of Jehovah and had brought them to Babylon and put them in the house of his god
In their false prophecy, the false prophets told Israel that in a short time these vessels would be brought back from Babylon
In verses 17 through 22 we have Jeremiah's genuine prophecy concerning the bringing back of the vessels of the house of Jehovah
These different prophecies confused the people, and it was hard for them to discern which were genuine and which were false
Jeremiah had put on a yoke to indicate that the people of Israel would be put under the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar
Jeremiah was to say to him, 'Thus says Jehovah, You have broken the wooden yoke bars, but you have made in their place iron yoke bars'
Finally, Jeremiah said to Hananiah that Jehovah had not sent him and that he had made this people trust in falsehood
Chapter twenty-nine is concerned with the destiny of the captives in Babylon and of those who remained in Judah
The children of Israel had been divided into two groups: one group in exile, in Babylon, and one group remaining in Judah
In his letter Jeremiah indicated to the exiles that they should expect not to return shortly but to stay in Babylon a long time
Jeremiah prophesied that when the seventy years of exile were fulfilled, Jehovah would visit them and bring them back to the holy land
He told them that Jehovah was sending upon them sword, famine, and pestilence, with which He would pursue them
In verses 21 through 23 we have a word about the false prophecy of Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah
For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, It will be long; build houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce'
Because of this shameful situation, it is difficult to help new believers to have a proper realization of the church
All these parts of Christ are members of His universal Body the church the divine organism of the Triune God to express Him the living One
In this message we will begin to consider the various aspects of this promised restoration revealed in chapters thirty and thirty-one
Again you will plant vineyards / On the mountains of Samaria; / The planters will plant / And will partake of the fruit'
Jehovah promised to bring them from the land of the north and to gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth
Jehovah has struck him with the striking of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, because of the greatness of his iniquity
According to verses 20 and 21, their children will be as they were of old, and their assembly will be established before Jehovah
If there were more than one leader, there would be different opinions, and these opinions would cause divisions
Jeremiah 31:37 is a word of assurance that Jehovah will not cast off all the seed of Israel for all they have done
In Jeremiah 30:8 Jehovah promised that, in that day, He will break the yoke from upon Israel's neck and tear off her bonds
As He was instituting His supper, He said, 'This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you'
In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man, seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament
The covenant made with Israel at Mount Sinai is called the first covenant , and the new covenant is called the second covenant
After the new covenant, God will not make any other covenants, for the new covenant is the consummation of God's covenanting with His people
The first covenant is called the covenant of law, and the second covenant is altogether wrapped up with God's divinity
The law of this life is wrapped up with the life-giving Spirit, who in Romans 8:2 is called 'the Spirit of life'
God, Christ, and the Spirit are this life, and through our regeneration this life is now within us to function as a law to us
God's economy is to dispense Himself into our being that our being may be constituted with His being to be one constitution with His being
Where can you hear a word about this in the Catholic Church, in the Orthodox Church, or in the Protestant denominations?
In the Lord's recovery, however, we place great emphasis on eternal life and on the inner law as the function of this life
All the messages given by this ministry are to strengthen and develop the divine life in its capacity for its function
As an illustration, let us suppose that a child is given two different things to taste, something bitter and something sweet
By the sense of taste which is an aspect of the function of human life the child knows to reject what is bitter and to receive what is sweet
The principle is the same with knowing God through the function of the divine life, the eternal life, within us
Eventually, there will be no need for outward teachings, for we will know God by the function of the divine life
God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that every one who believes into Him would not perish but would have eternal life
By dispensing Himself into us as life, God is accomplishing His economy, that He may have a corporate expression of Himself for eternity
Because we have been redeemed, justified, forgiven, and cleansed, we are free to contact God, and He is free to work Himself into us
We are told that Israel will serve Jehovah their God and David their King, whom Jehovah will raise up for them in the time of the millennium
As we consider the essence of the inner law of life, we see that this law has another aspect, that is, its function
There is not a positive thing concerning the carrying out of God's economy that this divine capacity is unable to do
According to its life, the law of the new covenant is the Triune God, and according to its function, it is the divine capacity
God remains God with the Godhead, and we, the believers, are made the same as God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
Since we are the same as God in life and in nature, we become His increase, His enlargement, as His fullness to express Him
In addition to causing us to be constituted with God, the capacity of the inner law constitutes us to be the Body of Christ
By this capacity we have the ability not only to know God but also to live God and even to be constituted with God
Nebuchadnezzar killed Zedekiah's sons in his presence and then put out his eyes and took him to Babylon, where he died
Jeremiah asked Jehovah why He told him to buy the field since the city of Jerusalem had been given into the hand of the Chaldeans
We see that Jeremiah came to know Gods intention and that His intention revealed in His word to Jeremiah became His promise to the prophet
As the Body of Christ, we should take the way of the inner law, which is the Triune God with His divine capacity
On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month'
We praise the Lord that in His restoration He will give His people one heart to love Him and express Him and one way to enjoy Him
In Jeremiah 32:40-44 Jehovah said that He would make an eternal covenant with them that He will not turn away from them
If we care for the number of the flock, eventually the Lord will multiply our flock to the extent that we will not be able to count them
Jehovah will establish the good word which He has spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah
He will cause to shoot forth a Shoot of righteousness unto David, who will execute justice and righteousness on the earth
In 23:6 it is Christ who is called Jehovah our righteousness, but here it is the city of Jerusalem which is called by this name
God is assuring His people that just as the universe remains forever, so the people of God and the royal family will also remain forever
Jehovah, the God of Israel, was bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil which He had spoken against them
Chapter thirty-six continues with Jehoiakim's stubbornness in burning Jeremiah's book of prophecy, and Jehovah's punishment
A leader among them, after hearing the word, went down to the king's house and told the princes there what he had heard in that book
After hearing all the words in it, they turned in fear one to another and told Baruch that they had to report all those words to the king
The princes went to the king in the court, and the scroll was read to the king and to all the princes who stood by him
As the scroll was being read the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month and the fire of the brazier was burning before him
From this we see that although Israel was stubborn in sinning against Jehovah, Jeremiah remained firm in his speaking for Him
Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim
Neither Zedekiah nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of Jehovah spoken through Jeremiah the prophet
The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt, and when the besieging Chaldeans heard the news, they withdrew from Jerusalem
Jehovah said, 'Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely go away from us; for they will not go away
When the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem, Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there
He was seized by the captain of the guard at the Gate of Benjamin and falsely accused of trying to desert to the Chaldeans
Later Zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king questioned him in the kings house secretly asking Is there any word from Jehovah
Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land'?
Zedekiah the king commanded the eunuch, the Cushite, to take with him thirty men to bring Jeremiah out of the pit before he died
After Jeremiah spoke these words, Zedekiah charged him not to let anyone know of these words and he would not die
Jeremiah did according to the word of the king and remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured
In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city and Jerusalem was captured
When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw the Chaldeans, they fled from the city by night by way of the king's garden
Following this, the Chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem
Some of the poorest people the captain of the bodyguard left in the land of Judah and gave them vineyards and fields at that time
After speaking to Jeremiah in this way, the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present and let him go
All of them returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to Gedaliah at Mizpah in the land of Judah
Johanan said secretly to Gedaliah that he would go and strike Ishmael so that Ishmael would not take Gedaliah's life
Johanan said, 'Why should he take your life, and all the Jews who are gathered to you be scattered and the remnant of Judah perish'?
Jeremiah 42:1 43:7 reveals the dishonesty of the remnant and the leaders in asking Jeremiah to pray for them after the fall of Jerusalem
They were told that they should not fear the king of Babylon, for Jehovah was with them to save and deliver them from his hand
Jehovah would show compassions to them, that the king of Babylon might have compassion on them and might bring them back to their own land
Jeremiah 43:8 44:14 is a record of the word of Jehovah through Jeremiah concerning the destiny of the remnant of Judah in Egypt
He would burn the houses of the gods of Egypt and smash the pillars of the temple of the sun in the land of Egypt
He would punish those who dwelt in the land of Egypt as He had punished Jerusalem: with sword, with famine, and with pestilence
They answered Jeremiah, saying that they would not listen to the word which he had spoken to them in the name of Jehovah
They made cakes to the queen of heaven, making images of her and pouring out libations to her, with their husbands
Jeremiah answered, saying that Jehovah had remembered the incense they had burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem
All the remnant of Judah who came to the land of Egypt to sojourn there would know whose word would be established, His or theirs
The principle in the Bible is that God does not want His chosen people to take anything other than Himself as their source
Jeremiah 34 45 is a section of twelve chapters showing us the stubbornness of Israel in sinning against Jehovah
In these chapters one thing is made clear that Israel has forsaken God as the source, the fountain, of living waters
Although he was faithful in caring for Jeremiah, God's prophet , he did not seek the Lord's word , because this was not his habit
If we see this, we will realize that the stubbornness of the children of Israel was due to their not being one with God
God would visit them and grace them and even use them to be His people as a testimony of the living God on earth
Jeremiah, who was not one to speak such a word, told them that he would pray to Jehovah according to their words
After ten days the word of Jehovah came to them through Jeremiah, telling them not to go to Egypt but to remain in Judah
They said to him, 'You are speaking falsehood; Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go to Egypt to sojourn there'
If they had been one with God, they would have received God's word and would have known His heart, His nature, His mind, and His purpose
The result is that we do not go along with God's will or God's mind, but rather express our opinions and care for our likes and dislikes
Those who are not one with God do not take His will and good pleasure but express their opinions and pursue their preferences
In His days Judah will be saved And Israel will dwell securely And this is His name by which He will be called Jehovah our righteousness
Based upon Christ's redemption we have been justified, and the Triune God has come into us to be our life, our person, and our everything
The book of Jeremiah was not written according to the historical sequence, but this book surely has a spiritual sequence
God lives in us and has the freedom, in matters great and small, to dispense Himself into our being to carry out His economy
Eventually we will know God, live God, and be constituted with God in His life and nature that we may be His corporate expression
Once we see the spiritual sequence in the Bible, we will realize that Jeremiah was written according to this sequence
After He created man, God presented Himself to man as the real and sole object for man to seek after, that is, the tree of life
After that, the history of mankind was nothing but a history of sins, with all the nations sinning continually in every way
God selected the children of Abraham to be a chosen people, but eventually they became the same as the nations
Just as God presented Himself as the tree of life in Genesis 2, so Christ also presented Himself as life in the Gospel of John
He presented Himself to people as the bread of life , that is, as the tree of life, and He told them that He came that they might have life
Eventually, this Jesus Christ became man's redemption and man's righteousness for man to receive justification from God
Based upon this, Christ as the embodiment of God has entered into us to be our life, even to be our inner law of life
Now we need to see that Jeremiah wrote his book of prophecy according to the sequence of the spiritual things recorded in the Bible
Jeremiah shows us that God presented Himself to Israel as the source, the fountain, of living waters to be their rich supply
The nations in the new heaven and new earth will eventually come from the nations concerning which Jeremiah prophesied
On the one hand, God needs a people to express Him; on the other hand, He needs another people to look at, to behold, this expression
We may say that those who express God are the 'actors' and that those who witness this expression are the 'spectators'
For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs both the actors His chosen people and the spectators the nations
The book of Jeremiah, following the spiritual sequence in the Bible, includes Jeremiah's speaking concerning the nations
Because the world has many aspects, the Old Testament uses the nations to typify the world in its various aspects
Jehovah delivered the people of Israel out of the Egyptian slavery and tyranny and brought them into the good land
The people of Israel were often tempted to go back to Egypt against Jehovah's will when they were weak or in trouble
Because Israel was in Egypt for more than four hundred years, they were accustomed to the Egyptian ways and liked the Egyptian food
Whenever the children of Israel had problems or were weak, they desired to go back to Egypt and take Egypt as their refuge
Pharaohs army returned to Egypt and the Chaldeans returned and fought against the city of Jerusalem and captured it and burned it with fire
He was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah
The Egyptians were wounded so that even if they had used many medicines, there would have been no healing for them
The Philistines typify the world that is close to the interest of God on earth and attacks and damages the testimony of God on earth
At Saul's time the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Judah, and David slew their champion Goliath
The Egyptian world attracts those in the church by their making a living and the pursuing of worldly enjoyment
The aspect of the world typified by Philistia constantly opposes and troubles the people of God and the church and hinders God's economy
In this message we will continue to consider God's judgment upon the nations involved with God's elect, Israel
He was very proud his loftiness, his pride, his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart were heard of by people
Jehovah would therefore bring to an end in Moab the one who offered up in high places and burned incense to his gods
The nation of Ammon typifies the world of fleshly lust that fights against God's chosen people and misleads them into idolatry
One is the fleshly world with religion to entangle God's people, and the other is the fleshly world that fights against God's people
As such a nation, Edom typifies the world of the old and fleshly man who struggles against the God-chosen and spiritual people
He will destroy the people of Edom, but He will preserve their orphans alive and let their widows trust in Him
Even with such a people, God is very concerned for the widows and the orphans and desires that they, and all human beings, trust in Him
Verse 26 speaks of her young men falling in her open squares, and all her men of war being cut off in that day
Verse 27 says that Jehovah would set fire to the wall of Damascus, and it would consume the palaces of her king Ben-hadad
Jeremiah 492832 reveals that Jehovah sent the Chaldeans to strike down Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor and destroy the children of the east
Verse 33 declares that Hazor, which once was a good place for flocks, would become a habitation of jackals, an eternal desolation
He would cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and He would bring evil upon them, even His burning anger
The coming Roman Empire and the Roman church will both in the spiritual sense be called Babylon the Great and will be destroyed by God
In verse 8a Jehovah charges them, saying, 'Flee from the midst of Babylon, / And go out from the land of the Chaldeans'
In those days the iniquity of Israel and the sin of Judah will not be found, for Jehovah will forgive those whom He will leave as a remnant
Neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken by his God; but their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel
Jehovah has brought forth our righteousnesses; / Come and let us relate in Zion / The work of Jehovah our God'
He had crushed them made them an empty vessel swallowed them up like a dragon filled his stomach with their delicacies and washed them away
And Babylon will become heaps, / A habitation of jackals, / An astonishment and a hissing, / Without inhabitant'
You who have escaped the sword, / Go and do not stand still; / Remember Jehovah from afar, / And let Jerusalem come up in your heart'
According to the Bible, the human government on earth is, in the eyes of God, altogether Babylonian from beginning to end
The image in Daniel 2 signifies four empires the Babylonian Empire the MedoPersian Empire the MacedonianGrecian Empire and the Roman Empire
In the last seven years of this age, he will make a covenant of peace with Israel, allowing Israel to worship God with freedom
Historically, in the past ten or more centuries, the city of Rome has been involved, even wrapped up, religiously with the Roman church
Three and a half years later, at the end of the great tribulation, the Lord Jesus will destroy the city of Rome
Babylon is the most evil thing on earth opposed to God; and once Babylon has been destroyed, it will not be restored
After writing concerning Israel, God's chosen people, Jeremiah wrote six chapters concerning the nations involved with Israel
The great human image in Daniel 2 represents the totality of human government on earth, which began at Babel and ends with the Roman Empire
In Revelation the Roman Empire is likened to a beast, and the Roman church is likened to a woman riding on a beast
Since the whole world has become Roman, under the influence of Roman government and Roman religion, it may seem that God has been defeated
To understand the events themselves is one thing, but to see the spiritual significance of these events is another thing
The sequence in which Jeremiah covered God's punishment on Israel and His judgment on the nations is very significant
Babel is the origin, the source, of man's worship of idols, man's rebellion against God, and human self-exaltation
After these things began the world became Egyptian with Egypt signifying the world in the aspect of making a living and having entertainment
Jeremiah presents us such a picture so that we can live a church life that is not polluted by the different aspects of the world
We need to know how to have a clear separation from the world and not be wrapped up or mixed with any of its aspects
In addition, the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar captured the holy vessels, which were used to serve God in the temple
Other people regarded those vessels as something holy, sanctified, and separated unto God and therefore did not dare to touch them
Babylon, therefore, is God's number one enemy, being both the beginning and the conclusion of human government on earth
Jeremiah presents God's economy to us that we may turn back to our source and origin, the Triune God as the fountain of living waters
Of enjoying Egypt as a good place for our living, we will enjoy the Triune God, and the church life will be our living
The first covenant God made with man was the covenant with the created man , and the second was His covenant with fallen man
After calling Abraham, God made a covenant with him , and this covenant was repeated with Isaac and with Jacob
After traveling in the wilderness for forty years, Israel came to the land of Moab, and there God made another covenant with them
Still, the covenant God made with Abraham corresponds to the new covenant and is the basis for the new covenant
If we study all these covenants thoroughly, we will see that God cares for only one covenant, the new covenant of life
The content of the new covenant is the Triune God, who has been processed and consummated to become everything to God's chosen people
Although Moses prophesied very much concerning Christ, the covenant God made with Israel through him had nothing to do with Jesus Christ
Sarah, the proper wife, represents the new covenant, and Hagar, the concubine, represents the old covenant of law
Because Hagar, the concubine, symbolizes the old covenant of the law, the position of this covenant is the position of a concubine
As Abraham cast out Hagar, when Christ came He put aside the old covenant and made it of no effect, replacing it with the new covenant
Without the old covenant of the law made through Moses, Jeremiah could not have exposed Israel to the uttermost
We see that the function of the law, which is something on the negative side, is to expose our fallen condition and situation
The book of Jeremiah may be likened to a walnut: on the outside there is a hard shell, and on the inside there is a kernel
In order to see these three things, we need to 'crack' the shell of Jeremiah and concentrate on the kernel inside
The more we drink of God, the more He is one with us and the more we are one with Him and constituted with Him in His life and nature
The most evil thing in the eyes of God is to forsake Him as the source, as the fountain of living waters, and to turn to some other source
As we consider this situation, we need to realize that God wants us to take Him as the fountain, the source, of our life and our being
In 17:9 he speaks regarding the human heart, saying, 'The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it'?
In our fallen condition we are corrupt and rotten; there is no way for us to change, correct, or improve ourselves
God wants us to take Him as our source and to drink of Him every day so that He may become the river of the water of life within us
Inwardly, He is the divine life to fill us, to make us one with God, and even to constitute us with God that we may live God
The subject of Lamentations is the expression of Jeremiah's sorrow and love over the holy city and the holy people of God
Lamentations 3:22-25 does involve God's economy, although not directly but indirectly through God's compassions
God was indignant and angry with Israel and came in to tell Jeremiah that He would judge this people to the uttermost
When Jeremiah heard the details concerning Jehovah's governmental dealing with Israel, he began to disagree somewhat with God
As he walked in the hills above Jerusalem, the more he looked at the destruction, the more the tears came and the more he lamented
Her circumstances were miserable because of her rebellion against the commandment of Jehovah, who is righteous
The destruction included the temple, the altar, the kings, the priests, the princes, the prophets, and the elders
Verses 18 and 19 tell of the need to cry to the Lord with eyes that weep unceasingly and hands uplifted toward the Lord
Because Jeremiah was one with God's afflicted people, in his feeling, in his sympathy, he was suffering the same kind of affliction
He hoped in Jehovah by waiting on Him and seeking after Him for His salvation , while depending on the Lord's doing and judging
Although this lamentation bears an Old Testament flavor, it is nevertheless in the sphere of the New Testament economy
At this juncture the word of Jehovah came to him, that no matter how much He had punished Israel, He had not utterly consumed them
It was through his contact with the Lord that he received this word regarding His lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness
Because He had made a covenant with Abraham and confirmed it with Isaac and Jacob, God had to be faithful to keep His word
Jeremiah enjoyed Jehovah as his portion, and he put his hope not in himself nor in the people nor in anything else but only in Jehovah
On the one hand, Jeremiah realized that God is a God of lovingkindness, that He is compassionate, and that His word is faithful
On the other hand, Jeremiah realized that we still need to contact the Lord every morning, put our entire hope in Him, and wait on Him
Like Jeremiah, we need to realize that God is still our portion and that we should hope in Him, wait on Him, and call upon His name
A certain Bible teacher pointed out that God acted quickly in saving us, but in many other things He does not act quickly
In addition, we need to realize that God is the portion of His people, and we need to put our hope and our trust in Him
They hoped that the punishment for their iniquity had been accomplished and that Jehovah would no longer take them into exile
In recalling Israel's past he was human, and in speaking regarding the coming punishment of Edom he was even more human
The phrase 'You, O Jehovah, remain forever' refers to God's eternal being, and it indicates that there is no change with Him
Jeremiah's writing here concerning God's eternal being and His eternal and unchanging government surely is divine
Although Jeremiah's expression in verse 19 is divine, he reverts to speaking in a very human way in verses 20 through 22
When Jerusalem is besieged by Antichrist, the Lord Jesus will turn to the children of Israel and appear to them
God's love and grace may change, but God's righteousness cannot change, because His righteousness is related to His government
God's lovingkindness and compassions can change, but God's person and His government remain unchanging forever
Jeremiah ended Lamentations not with God's lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness but with God's eternal being and His throne
Jeremiah speaks of the foxes roving in Mount Zion, and then he declares that Jehovah and His throne remain forever
Because of his background, he knew the writings of Moses, and he knew the covenant which God had made with Abraham and his descendants
Jerusalem was overthrown, the temple was burned down, God's people were carried away, but what about our God, Jehovah?
Jerusalem was finished, the temple was finished, and the land of Israel was finished, but Jehovah will never be finished
The fact that nothing remains and that everything is finished manifests the truth that Jehovah remains forever
Everything may be lost but You O Jehovah remain forever Your throne is from generation to generation with no beginning and no ending
Until then, Jeremiah must wait on Jehovah, just as he said in 3:25: 'Jehovah is good to those who wait on Him'
Jeremiah must wait until the New Testament age, until the age of the millennial kingdom, and until the New Jerusalem
