As long as someone is a citizen of a certain country, he is within the sphere of usefulness to that country and can be used by it
As far as man's feeling is concerned, creation and redemption are not enough to convince man that God intends to use him
The Lord's work of creating us was not as great as His work of putting within us a heart that is willing to be used by Him
In principle, the gentle, small voice within us is no different from the calling that Paul received on the road to Damascus
While God sometimes calls man in extraordinary ways, most of the time He comes to man and visits him in an ordinary way
The Bible shows us that while the Lord has the responsibility of visiting we also have a responsibilitythe responsibility of paying a price
Moses and David in the Old Testament and Paul and Peter in the New Testament were those who paid a price through the Lord's visitation
Rather, the Lord told him to enter into the city and let a little disciple called Ananias tell him in just a few sentences what he had to do
When Paul wrote 2 Timothy chapter four, he had already paid almost all that he could have paid, yet he was still pressing on
Due to the differences in the price that each of us has paid, our usefulness in the Lord's hands may differ from one to another
Now the question is not whether we have received the Lord's visitation but whether we are willing to pay a price
The Bible shows us clearly that the Lord is waiting for man to pay a price and be used by Him by answering His call
He intends to work in every age, yet there is a shortage of people who are willing to pay the price and answer His call
Whenever there is someone on earth who is willing to pay the price and answer the Lord's call, the Lord will surely use him
Noah's going up to a mountain symbolizes his being delivered from the judgment and escaping all the situations of rebellion against God
Although the whole world had fallen into a state of rebellion against God those who went to the mountain with Noah came out of the rebellion
The significance of Noah's going up to a mountain is the same as all those who would go up to a mountain after him
In the Bible there is another aspect of the significance of going up to a mountain-one goes up to a mountain for revelation
Finally, John's being brought up to a mountain when he was on the island of Patmos was especially for receiving revelation
The fact that one must go up to a mountain to receive revelation indicates that the receiving of revelation requires the paying of a price
If we want to receive revelation, we must determine to willingly pay a price, and we must also draw near to the Lord within
These are the basic requirements for us to have the experience of going up to a mountain and for us to receive revelation
These verses show us again and again how great is the price that must be paid by those who desire to follow the Lord
In the Gospels the Lord's unique requirement for those called by Him was that they forsake all their possessions
One day the Lord praised the widow who cast two lepta into the treasury, because she had cast in all that she had, even her whole living
On our side, the only time that we will not sense that He is demanding something of us is when we have lost our fellowship with Him
At first the Lord's requirements are small, but gradually His requirements become greater, deeper, and more severe
After a long period of time, the Lord will no longer have a way in us, and consequently, He will be forced to turn to someone else
For this reason, we would rather be wrong trying to obey than disobey altogether, and we would rather obey too much than obey too little
A person who consents to His demands can be used by the Lord even though he may not have a great deal of knowledge of the truth
The power we gain by paying a price to answer the Lord's demands is often greater than the power we receive through numerous prayers
The power for doing the Lord's work lies in one's learning this lesson, and in order to learn this lesson, one must pay a price
We all admire how useful people such as Paul and Peter were to the Lord yet we neglect the fact that they paid a great price before the Lord
We do not sense the presence of the Lord, we rarely contact Him in fellowship, and naturally, we have little usefulness before Him
The revelation in Philippians 3 is that we should pursue the experience of Christ and the power of His resurrection
We need to cast aside our ability our eloquence our doctrines and our messages and let Christ be our ability our eloquence and our message
Since we have gone out frequently to visit the saints, gradually we have learned something concerning this matter
Paul said that we should forget the things which are behind and stretch forward to the things which are before
Regardless of how good our past experiences were, they are the things which are behind and have to be forgotten
At this time, the price revealed in Philippians 3 will require him to give up all these 'considerables,' that is, to give up all things
In other words, in their midst there were too many things that were outside of God, and there was too little of the element of God
With regard to white garments, the color white denotes purity, the absence of mixture, and garments refer to our walk and conduct
When the eyes have an ailment and are unable to see, there is the need to buy eyesalve to cure the eyes and make them bright again
In normal situations, the inner nature of a Christian should be pure, and his outward living should be white and bright
Pursuing by our own determination often can become a matter of formality and therefore become inconsistent with reality
We cannot find that the Lord ever presided over a formal meeting while He was on the earth, because the Lord was not bound by formalities
In the Old Testament Gideon and his followers were tested in their daily life in the matter of how they drank water
It is in our daily living that people can detect whether we are truly seeking after the Lord and whether we can truly be used by the Lord
In order to become manifested before the Lord as those who are truly pursuing spiritual growth, we must take care of these two matters
Usually our situation is that the younger ones seek out the younger ones while the older ones seek out the older ones
Always seeking out those who are of your age group in order to talk intimately with them is not paying a price but having your preference
The real lessons of pursuing are learned in our daily life, and the real time to serve is during ordinary times
In the church life no one is solely a younger one or solely an older one; rather, everyone is a younger one and an older one as well
The same is true in the church-the more the saints grow in a normal way, the more firmly they keep their position
The Bible says that the younger ones should be subject to the older ones and that the older ones should take care of the younger ones
We all should know our position without waiting for others to give commands or depending on others to make arrangements
He cannot say whatever pleases him because he does not have the position to say anything, nor is it the proper time to say anything
A person who has truly learned this lesson will make every effort to speak when it is the proper time to speak
When we all come together, the position of the younger ones and the position of the older ones should be clearly manifested
We should realize that the younger ones' being able to listen to the older ones is a very glorious and sweet thing
One aspect concerns our inner sense, and the other aspect concerns the light of the truth given to us by the Lord
On the one hand, it involves the ruling of the heavens, and on the other hand, it requires the paying of a price
Matthew chapters five through seven, consisting of the teaching given on the mountain, concern the reality of the kingdom
Chapters twenty-four and twenty-five, consisting of the prophecies spoken on the Mount of Olives, concern the manifestation of the kingdom
The word concerning the appearance of the kingdom was given beside the sea, which signifies the world usurped and corrupted by Satan
Although the teachings covered in these three sections of Matthew differ in their content, they have one point in common
Matthew 13 requires us to be delivered from the great tree and the leaven and to be the wheat and mustard seed
In chapters twenty-four and twenty-five the price that we are required to pay has two aspects-the aspect of life and the aspect of work
To buy the oil-the aspect of life-is to forsake all outward things in our daily life and to care only for the indwelling Spirit
If we want God to work Himself into us and mingle with us, we must fulfill the second requirement-we must pay a price
To pay a price is to put aside everything that is apart from God in order to receive the second part of God's salvation
We must do this because God in Christ intends to work Himself into us so that we may be united and mingled with Him
We need to forsake to put aside everything apart from God regardless of whether those things are good or bad in the past or in the future
We must put aside everything that is not in agreement with God and that opposes God, replaces God, and is a substitute for God
If we rely on numerous persons, things, and matters and do not commit ourselves wholly to God, He cannot be everything within us
If our families, husbands or wives, and children are sweeter to us than God, then God cannot be everything within us
If our education, fame, position, and future are more lovable to us than God, then God cannot be our inner enjoyment and constituent
Suppose that although we believe in God, we live by things that are outside of God, and these things are everything to us
When we live this way, not only have we not fulfilled what is required of us, but also God's intention cannot be attained in us
We have not paid the price, and paying the price is the requirement for God to work Himself into us and be mingled with us
The part of salvation concerning forgiveness of sins and the receiving of eternal life can be obtained by faith alone
Paul said explicitly that since God operates in us both the willing and the working, we must obey with fear and trembling
We must pay the price and deny ourselves, forsaking our family, career, and future and discarding everything that replaces God
Matthew says that we need to buy the oil , and Revelation says explicitly that we need to buy gold, white garments, and eyesalve
They once had been under the usurpation of those things, and God therefore had no opportunity, no ground, and no way in them
Eventually they realized that all those things should not be the goals of their pursuit but that God Himself should be their unique goal
The rich young man in the Gospels loved the Lord and wanted to follow the Lord, yet eventually he went away sorrowing
Whenever a person is usurped by his reputation future position power and relatives there is no way for Christ to have the first place in him
The Gospel of John obviously concludes with chapter twenty yet the writer added another chapterchapter twentyone which is of another nature
The first twenty chapters of John speak about faith, but the last chapter, chapter twenty-one, speaks about love
The result is that by handing yourself and all you have over to God, God and all that He has are mingled with you
Rather, it is for you and all that you have to be taken away and for God and all that He has to be added to and mingled with you
Those who participate in the out-resurrection are those who have lived in the power of Christ's resurrection today
Rather, it is only those who have paid a price and are thereby filled with Christ who will be able to enter into the kingdom
Rather, it is the Christ with whom you are filled who brings you into the kingdom and qualifies you to be a king
He wrote a book with the title, Narrative of the Lord's Dealings with George Muller, which corresponds exactly with the content of the book
In summary, the first requirement for our being used by God is God's visitation, which is not of us but of God
Merely having such a desire does not enable us to be used by God, because on our side we still have to pay a price
We work that we may overflow the Lords life imparting and ministering the Lords life to others that is imparting the Lord Himself to others
In our fellowship with the brothers and sisters or in our going out to visit the saints, apparently we are helping and establishing people
A message released from the platform may be convincing and inspiring, but it may not necessarily impart Christ's life to people
An exposition of the Scriptures may be interesting and enjoyable to people, but it may not necessarily impart Christ's life to them
After his speaking, the listeners have the feeling that something unexplainable, something spiritual, has come into them
Sometimes when a certain brother stands up in the meeting to speak, his voice is loud and clear, and his words flow smoothly
After the sounding and clanging are over, there is nothing left, and those who have heard it have not received any life
While you are sitting before him, he may not say anything, yet you sense that something has entered into you and touched your feelings
If you love sins and the world, the sense he gives you may touch a particular sin or a particular aspect of the world and even condemn it
You may meet a certain person who speaks a lot, yet not one of his words enters into you and touches your feelings
The first person did not speak many words to exhort you, but just by a little contact with you, he touched your problem
Only by the overflow of life can we touch people's inner being, and once we touch them in this way, something spiritual will enter into them
To be used by God is to work for Him, and to work for Him is to overflow God's life, to dispense God's life and God Himself, to others
It shows us that in God's eyes we were prodigal sons who were far away from God the Father and that we were also lost sinners and lost sheep
At the outset, the Gospel of John shows us that the Lord was God, that in Him was life, and that He became flesh
If we read through the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, we will discover that it is not so easy to find passages about salvation by faith
After we are saved and have received the life of God, we still need to walk on the Lord's way and live a heavenly life
We need to make an effort every day to enjoy what we have received, taking the Lord in by eating and drinking Him in our spirit day by day
If we do not pay such a price and do not make such an effort, we cannot practically and fully enjoy the salvation we have received
Christians of this kind are different from unsaved people in their beliefs, but in their daily walk they are the same as the unsaved
Just as the unsaved ones love the world, live for the world, and struggle for fame and wealth, so also do these saved ones
Luke and John show us from one side that upon believing in the Lord, we receive forgiveness of sins and the life of God
For this reason, we have to pay a price, leave everything we have, deny ourselves, and take up the cross to follow the Lord
Although the goal of our salvation includes the blessing of entering into the kingdom, it is not restricted merely to such a blessing
The goal of God's salvation is that the believers gradually grow and mature in life until, consummately, they are exactly the same as Christ
To grow unto maturity means that Christ lives in us as our life and that He continually grows in us to the extent that He is formed in us
The Bible also tells us that after a person has been saved and has received the Lord's life, he becomes part of the crop in the Lord's field
Revelation 14 tells us that among the Christians a small number of overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest
In northern China by the month of April the wheat in the field has grown very tall and displays a golden color
After another two weeks the rest of the harvest in the field ripens, and the owner reaps the crop and brings it into the barn
Matthew 13 clearly tells us that the field refers to the world, and the barn refers to the kingdom of the Father
If the crop were not ripe but still green and tender, the owner of the field would never harvest the crop and bring it into the barn
What is the requirement for us, the crop, to be gathered from the field on the earth into the barn in the heavens?
Unless he goes on to pay a price be dealt with and have the experience of being exposed to the sun he cannot readily grow and become mature
If we read through Revelation carefully, we can see that all the Christians who will be in the kingdom will be the ripened ones
In the Chinese Union Version the term heavenly mansion is found in two places-in 1 Peter 3:22 and also in Hebrews 9:24
It is correct to say that Christians will one day enter into the kingdom, but they must first be mature before they can do so
Perhaps someone may wonder, 'Many of the brothers and sisters have truly received forgiveness of sins and the Lord's life
Since the time they were saved, they have not paid a price, lived an overcoming life, or faithfully followed the Lord
The Bible says that it is not until the harvest is ripe that the crop will be reaped and brought into the eternal barn
Those who mature earlier will be gathered into the barn earlier while those who mature later will be brought into the barn later
Abraham's bosom-the place where Lazarus was, across from the place where the rich man was-was the Paradise in Hades
They say this based upon Ephesians 4:8, which says, 'Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive'
At the Lord's return their spirits will come out of Hades and their bodies will also come out of the graves to become glorious bodies
When their spirits are clothed with their bodies again, then they will be able to enter into the presence of God
In the Bible disembodied spirits are naked spirits, which still bear the sign of death and therefore cannot enter into the presence of God
The believers who die without being matured in life will be unable to go into the presence of God even after being clothed in resurrection
If we do not walk on this way and do not arrive at this goal, then we should not expect to one day go in to the Lord's wedding feast
Many Christians do not have a clear, accurate knowledge of the truth concerning the plan of God's salvation and the economy of God's grace
Just as a businessman knows how to manage his wealth, so also God has His management, His economy, in the universe
If we read the book of Ephesians carefully, we will see that it is quite complicated and not as simple as we think
If this happens, not only would it deprive people of the supply of life, but it will also become a hindrance to them
Catholicism and Protestantism have done much to harm people's spiritual lives, the Lord's work, and God's economy
The reason many have been damaged by Catholicism and Protestantism is that they do not have an accurate, thorough knowledge of the truth
Catholicism teaches that after a person dies, he has to be disciplined in purgatory for the sins he committed in the past
Many in Catholicism have the thought that while a person is alive, he does not need to apply the effectiveness of the Lord's precious blood
It is surprising that such a thought, such a concept, can exist in Catholicism and that it is believed and accepted by almost all Catholics
The Bible never says that the soul of a person who has believed in Jesus and has been saved will go to a heavenly mansion when he dies
It is true that the Chinese Union Version has the term heavenly mansion, but this is because of the way this word was translated
Some English versions of the Bible use the word economy or dispensation, which means 'arrangement' or 'distribution'
The Bible says that the God who works all things dispenses grace to us according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ
Ephesians 1 says that God 'chose us in Him before the foundation of the world unto sonship through Jesus Christ'
John 3 says that undoubtedly 'now we are children of God,' yet 'it has not yet been manifested what we will be'
We were just lumps of clay, yet we were created by God to be vessels, even vessels that He had prepared beforehand unto glory
Formerly we loved as we pleased and lost our temper as we desired, but now it is not so convenient for us to do these things anymore
When we are about to love someone or to lose our temper, the One who is in us holds us back and bothers us, causing us to have no peace
Christ will spread from our spirit to fully occupy our soul, and then He will permeate our body, and glory will be expressed
At that time, we will be matured and ready to be raptured because Christ will have fully grown and been fully formed in us
We should try not to commit big sins, but if once in a while we commit small sins, we don't have to think too much about it
A person cannot go in a casual manner even to meet the president of a nation, not to mention going to meet the Lord
God's salvation is not according to the doctrine taught in degraded Christianity but according to His purpose of grace
God's salvation is not what many people imagine it to be-a matter of heaven and hell, of going to either heaven or hell
We all should pray for the church and for the Lord to give grace to His church so that the church may go on in the way of His recovery
It has been more than four hundred years since the Reformation at the time of Martin Luther, and God is still recovering His truths
The Lord Jesus' being holy was for service, His being righteous was for service, and His being strong and overcoming was for service
In our consecration we should experience a crisis, in which we leave the realm of not serving God and enter into the realm of serving God
They do not realize that life is for service, salvation is for service, sanctification is for service, and overcoming is for service
It seems that service is an outward act according to verse 1, but actually service is a story of the life that is within us
Many times we hear people praising, 'O Lord, praise You that Your life is holy, powerful, bright, and spiritual'
In chapters twenty-one and twenty-two we see the manifestation of the New Jerusalem in the new heavens and new earth in eternity future
From the beginning of chapter twenty-one through verse 2 of chapter twenty-two we see the nature of the New Jerusalem
There are three short verses, verses 3 through 5, which show us what the people in the New Jerusalem will be doing
Eventually, the function of a prophet grows out of one saint while the function of a teacher grows out of another
Only those who have a high level of eloquence, who can talk fluently and endlessly, are really good for something
Whether or not we are useful to the Lord depends solely on whether or not the Lord's life has had the opportunity to grow in us
Regardless of what you are in your natural man, when you are willing to give place to the life of Christ, then He will live out of you
Rather, it is only when Christ finds a way, an opportunity, and an outlet to come out of us that we will be useful
Rather, our capital and our resources are the life within us, which is the living Christ, the boundless Christ
Because we do not allow Him to have the ground and the opportunity to grow, He cannot come out, and therefore we cannot minister to people
The life is the same, and the blood cells are also the same, but they manifest different functions in different members
We may be very zealous, willing to pursue the Lord, and regular in attending the meetings, but what is our use in the Lord's hands?
Today the greatest reason for not knowing whether or not we are useful in the Lord's hands is that we do not practice these five items
We do not practice to love the Lord absolutely, to consecrate ourselves, to give up our future, to be dealt with, or to be broken
Although he was a saved one and was interested in spiritual things, the serving life could not be released through him
Concerning this thorn, he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him, yet the Lord did not remove it
A person who is being dealt with every day has a strong sense that his flesh is present and that he is truly fleshly
The Lord's enlightenment, second our receiving or our executing, and third the coordination of the circumstances
We know that the life of Christ has the element of death, and when this element passes through us, it does a killing work in us
Once the Holy Spirit has gained a place in us, He will lead us daily to put to death our natural life and our flesh
Eventually, when we are about to lose our temper, we will no longer be able to do it because we have been broken and have many wounds in us
