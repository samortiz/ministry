   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON NINETEEN THE DENIAL OF THE SELF Scripture Reading: Matt 16:23-26; Luke 9:25; Gal 5:16b, 24; Rom 7:18-21; Matt 19:16, 20 OUTLINE The difference between the self and the flesh: The flesh being the corrupted and transmuted body Gal 5:16b, 24.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The self being the fallen and rebellious soul Matt 16:26; Luke 9:25.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the flesh dominates the self, the self becomes an evil person Rom 7:18-21.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the self subdues the flesh, the self becomes a "good" person Matt 19:16, 20.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The self being independent of God Matt 16:23-24.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The self being the embodiment of the soulish life, one with Satan, and expressed through the mind opinionated thoughts Matt 16:23-24.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The self being the hidden, damaging factor of our service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The self needing to be crossed out Matt 16:24-25.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the foregoing lessons on service, beginning from lesson thirteen, we have dealt with many negative things that frustrate and damage our service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lesson thirteen is on the danger and loss of not using our gift.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lesson fourteen is on the strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lesson fifteen shows us that we need to take heed how to build.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not build with wood, grass, or stubble, but with gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lesson sixteen speaks of the impotence of our natural being in the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we saw in lessons seventeen and eighteen that we need to know the flesh in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to help the saints realize that in the service of the church we must know all these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are not clear about these negative things and do not have a thorough clearance from these negative things, we can never have a proper church service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are not cleared up from all these negative things, we are still in Christianity in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So it is worthwhile for us to stay with the saints on all these negative points.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this lesson we want to see the need for the denial of the self in our service to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The outline for this lesson is simple, but there is the need for much development, labor, and prayer on our part to enter into its intrinsic significance.</S>
