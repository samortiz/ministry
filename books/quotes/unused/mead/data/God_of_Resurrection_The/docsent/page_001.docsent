   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"We were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living; but we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead" 2 Cor 1:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"If indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory" 2 Cor 4:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"For they indeed disciplined us for a few days as it seemed good to them, but He for our profit that we might partake of His holiness" Heb 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"We know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son" Rom 8:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"God...who gives life to the dead" Rom 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"I am...the living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever" Rev 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suffering is the lot of all the inhabitants of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>None can evade it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people imagine that if you believe on the Lord and live in His fear, you will be immune from all ills; yet numbers of Christians are grievously afflicted, and some who live in vital touch with God are in constant suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The unsaved keep asking: "If God loves the world, why does He allow all this sorrow?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And the saved keep asking: "If God loves His children, why does He let so much trouble befall them?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others go still further and inquire: "How does it come about that, the more spiritual you become, the more hardship you meet?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are practical questions, not mere theoretical quibbles, and we have to face them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why should man, who has been created by God, be subject to suffering throughout the whole course of his life?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why should men still continue to suffer after they become children of God?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And why should men's sufferings increase with the increase of their devotion to God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In my early days, I spent a considerable amount of time looking into this problem of suffering; but because my knowledge of the Lord was superficial, I was only able to draw these conclusions from my studies: 1 Man is prone to error; therefore suffering is necessary for his correction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2 Suffering is needful if we are to comfort others, for only they who themselves have suffered can truly help other people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3 The discipline of suffering is essential if we are to acquire endurance, for, as Romans 5 says: "Tribulation works endurance."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4 Suffering is inevitable if we are to be molded into vessels that will be of use to God.</S>
