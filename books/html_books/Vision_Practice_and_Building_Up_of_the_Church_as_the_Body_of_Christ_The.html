<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California between January 1965 and March 1966. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE<br />
CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9-11; 1:4-11; 3:19; Col. 2:9; Eph. 1:19; Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 1:24</h1>
<p>In these messages our burden is to consider the church in six aspects. First, we need to see the church in eternity past in the purpose and plan of God. Second, we must see the church in the Old Testament types, shadows, and figures. Although it may seem that the church is not mentioned in the Old Testament, in actuality there are many references to the church in the Old Testament in the way of types and figures. A number of positive women in the Old Testament are types of the church. Eve is the first type of the church (Gen. 2:22; 3:20). After Eve come Sarah and Rebekah (17:15-16, 19; 24:15, 64-67). Eventually, we come to the Shulammite in the Song of Songs (6:13). In Eve we see only the origin of the church, but the Shulammite as the counterpart of Solomon is a type of the church in a full way. In addition, the positive buildings in the Old Testament are types of the church, including the ark of Noah, the tabernacle, the temple, and the holy city Jerusalem. In order to study the church, we need to study the stories of all these women and of all these buildings. In a corporate way, we may call them the bride and the house, and we may call these two aspects of the church the bridal aspect and the building aspect. The church is a &ldquo;bride-building.&rdquo; We need to read and study the stories of all those positive women to know the bridal aspect of the church, and we need to study the stories of all those wonderful buildings to know the building aspect of the church. Eventually at the end of the entire Scripture as an ultimate consummation and conclusion, there is a city with two aspects, the bridal aspect and the building aspect. The holy city, New Jerusalem, is the bride, and it is also the tabernacle (Rev. 21:9-10, 3).</p>
<p>We also need to see the progress of the church&mdash;what transpired with the church and what the church has undergone since the day of Pentecost&mdash;and the recovery of the church from the time of the Reformation to the present century. We must also consider the testimony of the church and the church in the future. Altogether these are six main aspects of the church: in eternity past in God&rsquo;s plan and purpose, in the Old Testament types, in its progress, in its recovery, in its present testimony, and in eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN GOD</h2>
<p>Almost all the items revealed concerning God&rsquo;s eternal plan for the church are in two books&mdash;Ephesians and Colossians. Ephesians contains the revelation of the Body, while Colossians is the revelation of the Head. If we put these two together, we have the universal man, the Head with the Body. In order to know the Body we must know the Head, and in order to know the Head we need to know the Body. Therefore, if we are going to know Ephesians, we must know Colossians, and if we are going to know Colossians, we must know Ephesians. To know the eternal plan of God concerning the church, we need to come to the book on the Body, Ephesians, with the help of the book on the Head, Colossians.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:9-11 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; I would ask the young brothers and sisters, if possible, to memorize these three verses. <em>To enlighten all</em> in verse 9 means to bring to light. In Greek, <em>all</em> is an all-inclusive word, including men, angels, heaven, earth, and the many items of creation.</p>
<p>Verse 9 also speaks of the economy of the mystery. <em>Economy</em> and <em>mystery</em> are two great words in the Bible. A complete dictionary such as Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary gives the origin of the word <em>economy. Economy</em> is from the Greek word <em>oikonomia.</em> This economy was hidden in God. Before the creation there was only God Himself. At that time only God Himself knew the mystery. Then ever since the time of creation, God never told anyone about His mystery. Throughout the ages this mystery was known only by God Himself; it was something hidden in God as a mystery that not one of the creatures knew, including the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Eternal Purpose (Plan)<br />
Which God Purposed in Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 10 speaks of the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies and of the multifarious wisdom of God. These also are great matters. Verse 11 mentions the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord. For <em>purpose</em> we may use the word <em>plan</em> also. The eternal plan, or eternal purpose, is a great matter. This passage speaks of a single aim concerning the church, that is, to make God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom known to the rulers and authorities. This is according to the eternal plan which God planned in Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy, Arrangement, Administration, Dispensation, and Stewardship</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:8-11 says, &ldquo;Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this passage we can see God&rsquo;s eternal purpose concerning the church. The church is something of God&rsquo;s economy. The word <em>economy</em> means an &ldquo;arrangement, an administration, a dispensation, a stewardship.&rdquo; When we put all these words together&mdash;<em>stewardship, dispensation, arrangement, administration</em>&mdash;we have an economy. The word <em>economy</em> means very much. It means that God made an arrangement and an administration to do something, which is to dispense Himself to man.</p>
<p>The church is the central matter in God&rsquo;s economy. To use our human words, the church is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;business.&rdquo; Business is the central matter in an economy. A big corporation has an economy to do a certain business. God also has an economy, and in this economy God&rsquo;s divine business is the church. God&rsquo;s economy is to have the church. Therefore, the church is not a small item. Many Christians do not realize the church to such an extent. We may have the thought that the church is merely a gathering of people who were fallen and now are saved and come together to worship God. However, this is too low a thought. If we think this, we have never looked from the heavens, and we have never looked from eternity. If we would look from the heavens and into eternity, we will see that the church is higher than the traditional Christian thought about it. It is the central item of God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s dispensation, administration, arrangement, and governmental stewardship are for the church. We need to realize the church to such an extent.</p>
<p>Because the church is the central item in God&rsquo;s economy, it was planned by God. The church did not come about by accident or all of a sudden. It was planned by God in eternity past. That is why Ephesians 1:10 mentions God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church, and 3:11 speaks of the eternal purpose which God made. God purposed and planned to have the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Eternal in Nature</h2>
<p>The church is something eternal because it is something of the eternal plan of God. <em>Eternal</em> is a matter not only of time but also of nature. <em>Eternal</em>means unlimited in time, but it also refers to the uncreated nature. Anything that is created is not eternal; anything uncreated is eternal. Only God is uncreated, so only God is eternal. If the church were not mingled with God, the church could not be eternal. All created things are merely in time, not in eternity. Only when God Himself mingles with us do we have eternity, the eternal nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being in God Himself</h2>
<p>The church is according to the economy of God, it is the purpose or plan of God, and it is eternal. The church is also in God Himself (1:4-5). Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; Several times the writer of Ephesians uses the word <em>Himself</em> with emphasis, instead of simply <em>Him</em> (v. 9; 2:15; 4:11; 5:2, 27). The church must be something of God and in God Himself. To be in God Himself is the real meaning of the word <em>holy.</em> The wooden boards of the tabernacle became golden by being in the gold. In the same way, to be holy means to be in God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being in Christ and for Christ</h2>
<p>The church is also something in Christ and for Christ (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 1:22; Eph. 2:6, 10; 3:10-11). I hope that you would remember well these five points: the church is God&rsquo;s purpose, it is God&rsquo;s economy, it is eternal, it is in God Himself, and it is in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Have Many Sons as His Multiplication</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention concerning the church is first to produce many sons with His life (1:5). All these sons have the life of God and inherit all that He is, all that He has, all that He planned, and all that He accomplished. Every member of the church is a son of God and also will eventually be an heir of God. In this sense, God&rsquo;s intention for the church is to multiply and reproduce Himself, to have a mass reproduction of Himself. If a man has many sons, all these sons are his multiplication. A few years ago, there was only the one man by himself, but today there are many of him&mdash;he is the original, and his sons are his duplication and multiplication. The multiplication of God is His family, and His family is the church.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 speaks of the sonship. The real meaning of sonship is the multiplication of God. God is unlimited, but God still needs a great multiplication. After God created Adam, He told him to multiply and replenish the earth, that is, to fill up the earth (Gen. 1:28). God&rsquo;s intention for the church is to produce many sons, to multiply Himself. John 12:24 tells us that the one grain would become many grains. The many grains are the multiplication, duplication, and reproduction of the one grain.</p><h2 class="head3">The Proper Meaning of Sonship</h2>
<p>We need to know the proper spiritual vocabulary, including the word <em>sonship.</em> Sonship indicates that we have the life, birth, and right of inheritance of a son. Birth is one thing, and the birthright is another. Esau and Jacob both had the same birth and the same life, but only one&mdash;Jacob&mdash;had the birthright. Therefore, Esau had the life of a son but not the full sonship. Sonship is birth plus birthright. All real Christians have the birth of the sons of God, but not all today have the birthright. At least by the time of the New Jerusalem, we all will have the birthright. Before that time, only the overcomers will enjoy the birthright of the sons of God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:16-17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. And if children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.&rdquo; There is a difference between children and heirs. Children have the proper birth, but heirs have not only the birth but also the birthright. We must first be the children; then we must become heirs. If we are children without the birthright, we do not have the full sonship.</p>
<p>Through our birth, both in the physical and spiritual realms, we received life. When we were born of our father, we received our father&rsquo;s life. Through the birthright, however, we receive the inheritance of all that our father is and has. Because we have been born again, we have received the life of God. However, simply because we are children of God does not mean that we are heirs of God. We may be children yet not be heirs. The book of Hebrews helps us to realize what the birthright is. Hebrews does not speak much about the divine birth; rather, it speaks of the birthright. Hebrews 12:15 says, &ldquo;Looking carefully lest anyone fall away from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and through this many be defiled.&rdquo; To fall away from the grace of God does not mean that the one who falls has not been born again. He has been born again, but after someone is born again, there is a possibility that he will fall away from the grace of God.</p>
<p>Verses 16 and 17 continue, &ldquo;Lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one meal gave up his own birthright. For you know that also afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for repentance, even though he sought it with tears.&rdquo; As those who are born again, there is the possibility for us to enjoy the birthright, but there is also the possibility that we may lose the birthright. Many Christians are in danger of losing the birthright. They are the real children of God, but for a certain period of time they will not be the heirs.</p>
<p>We must remember well that sonship in the Scriptures means birth plus birthright. By the spiritual birth we have received the life of God, but it is by the birthright that we will inherit all that God is, all that God has, all that God has planned, and all that God will accomplish. God is the Father, and He has many things that He has planned and will accomplish. All that God Himself is, all that He has, and all that He has planned and will accomplish together are the inheritance. God&rsquo;s election, God&rsquo;s purpose in choosing us, is that we may have His life to become His sons and then inherit Himself as our everything, including all that He has, has planned, and will accomplish. Life plus inheritance added together equals the sonship. This is a very profound item.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Sonship Meaning That We Are in God Himself</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 tells us that we are predestinated unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself. Here Paul uses a strong word&mdash;not only <em>Him</em> but <em>Himself.</em> The phrase <em>to Himself</em> is very meaningful. In Greek it means <em>unto</em> or <em>into Himself</em>. This is not a small matter. <em>Into Himself</em> implies that we must get into God. God predestinated us unto sonship through Christ so that we may get into God. We have seen that sonship means that we receive God&rsquo;s life into us and will inherit all that God is, all that He has, and all that He will accomplish. Here, though, we have another aspect. Sonship is also for us to get into God. We all have to learn to study the Word carefully and remember phrases such as <em>to Himself.</em></p>
<p>Every part of verse 5 is important, including <em>predestinated,</em><em> unto sonship, through Jesus Christ,</em>and <em>to Himself.</em>The last phrase says, &ldquo;According to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; Here we see the good pleasure of God and the will of God. Verse 6 continues, &ldquo;To the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved.&rdquo; <em>Graced us in the Beloved</em> is a hard phrase for the translators of the Bible. There may be no human word except in the original Greek to express the right meaning of this phrase. It means that God made us the very goal and object of His grace. We may translate this phrase as, &ldquo;Made us the object of His grace in the Beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Produce a Holy City with God&rsquo;s Divine Nature</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention concerning the church is also that the church may be holy. Ephesians 1:4 says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love.&rdquo; We need to know the proper, full, and deeper meaning of the word <em>holy</em> in the Scriptures. Even up to the present day in Christianity this word is not understood in a full way. The ultimate consummation of the Bible is a holy city, corresponding to the word <em>holy</em> in this verse. The purpose of God&rsquo;s selection and choosing is to make us holy. On the one hand, to be holy is to be separated unto God, but this is its superficial meaning. The deeper meaning of <em>holy</em> is to be mingled with God. We have to be mingled and overlaid with God in His holy and divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), just as the items in the tabernacle were overlaid with gold. The furniture in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle appear to be golden, not wooden. However, we should not say that there is no wood. Rather, all the wooden furnishings have one appearance, that is, the appearance of gold. Therefore, we may say that all those wooden items became golden; that is, they became holy.</p>
<p>Gold signifies the divine nature as God&rsquo;s holiness. God is holy; that is His nature. In Revelation 21 we are told that the holy city, New Jerusalem, is golden. That the city itself is gold indicates that it is holy. To be separated unto God is only the beginning. We are separated for the purpose of being overlaid with gold, that is, overlaid with God. To be holy, we must be mingled with God. To be holy is not only to be separated unto God, but even the more to be in God, to be overlaid with God, to be mingled with God, just as the wooden boards of the tabernacle were in the gold by being overlaid with gold. In order to be in God we must be overlaid with God. The little word <em>in</em> is used many times in the New Testament for this purpose; we are in God, in Christ, in the Holy Spirit, in Himself, and He is in us. The proper meaning of being holy is that we are made to be in God.</p><h2 class="head3">To Be Holy and without Blemish before God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:4 says that we are holy and without blemish before Him in love. To be without blemish does not mean that we are perfect. Even if we seem to be perfect and holy, we still have blemishes if we are not overlaid with God. If someone were to bring to the tabernacle a board that was perfect, clean, and good but not overlaid with gold, it would be considered blemished. Only after it is overlaid with gold can it be without blemish.</p>
<p>To be without blemish also means that we are fully corresponding to what God desires, that we satisfy God&rsquo;s desire in a full way. A sister may love her guests very much and cook many good things for them, but if what she prepares does not match their desire, it is blemished. In the same way, to be holy and without blemish before God means that we fully satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. The church with the sonship, being holy and without blemish, fully satisfies God&rsquo;s desire. One day we will see the reality of this. The New Jerusalem will be the real sonship, the real holiness, and that which is truly without blemish before God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Display the Manifold Wisdom of God</h2>
<p>The foregoing items of God&rsquo;s intention concerning the church are on the positive side. On the negative side, the church deals with the enemy of God. In Ephesians 1 there is the positive side, the positive aspect of the church, while in chapter 3 there is the negative side related to the enemy. Through the church God&rsquo;s manifold wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities, and the enemy is subdued (v. 10). If there were not such an evil one in the universe, God&rsquo;s wisdom would not need to be manifested. It is through all the troubles rendered by Satan that God has the opportunity to show forth His wisdom. This whole universe has been damaged, but God is willing for it to be damaged, because He has His purpose. God needs such an evil one as Satan to damage the universe so that God&rsquo;s wisdom may be fully manifested. Every damage from Satan is a good opportunity to display God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>We should never be afraid of troubles or damage in the church. Whenever there is a troubling to the church, we must go to God and say, &ldquo;God, we praise and thank You. Here is a good chance for You to show forth something.&rdquo; Eventually we will see that a glorious church will come out. Many &ldquo;stories&rdquo; have been inserted into the history of the church. Some are happy, but others seem sorrowful. If we consider the condition of the church, we may be bothered. Problems come from the brothers, and they come from the sisters. If we have the vision, however, we will always be happy. Praise the Lord, the more troubles there are, the more opportunities there are to display the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>We need to thank the Lord that He gives us many troublesome brothers and sisters. God&rsquo;s wisdom is made manifest through, by, in, and with all the problems. The Lord Jesus told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (John 2:19). Their destroying simply gave the Lord the opportunity to build up something greater than what was destroyed. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s view the situation is glorious. In our dictionary <em>troublesome</em> is a good word, not a bad word. We have to change our way of thinking. <em>Troublesome</em> actually means wonderful. All the &ldquo;troublesome&rdquo; brothers and sisters are wonderful. Without them God&rsquo;s wisdom could not be manifest. I have been a Christian and have worked for the Lord for many years. Many times I was disappointed by certain brothers. However, one day in the New Jerusalem we will see those brothers, and we will marvel at what kind of wonderful persons they have become.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAPITAL, POWER, AND WISDOM<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>All the above items are related to God&rsquo;s purpose, aim, goal, and intention. Moreover, in order to have a business, an economy, we need three things. First, we need the capital, the finances, the funds. Without the capital, we can do nothing. Then we also need the power, the strength, to run our corporation. Third, we need the wisdom, the best way, to do things. We may have the biggest corporation with the most capital, but if we do not have the power, we can do nothing. Likewise, if we have the capital and the power but not the wisdom to run the corporation in the right way, the corporation will become bankrupt. A successful corporation needs the capital, the power, and the way, the wisdom. In the two books of Ephesians and Colossians we can see these three matters for God&rsquo;s economy, His administration and &ldquo;corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capital in God&rsquo;s economy is God Himself. Ephesians 3:19 says that the church is filled unto all the fullness of God. God Himself is the finance. He Himself is the greatest capital with which He runs His business. The fullness of God in the church is the fullness of the Godhead that dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). Therefore, the fullness of God, that is God Himself with all that He is, is the very capital, the finance, of His economy.</p>
<p>In these two books we also have the power. Ephesians 1:19 and 20 speak of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies. This is the divine power. Moreover, the apostle Paul tells us that the power for him to minister was an inward energizing power (Col. 1:29). There was something within Paul that energized him all the time, and he served and ministered by this power.</p>
<p>Moreover, the wisdom for God&rsquo;s economy is Christ as the wisdom of God. First Corinthians 1:24 tells us that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. Therefore, God Himself, God&rsquo;s divine power, and God&rsquo;s divine, manifold wisdom are the three items for God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy, His corporation, is carried out by God Himself as the capital, God&rsquo;s divine power, and God&rsquo;s divine wisdom as the way. Praise the Lord, the church is the very center of this economy! God carries out this economy&mdash;that is, He produces the church&mdash;with Himself as the capital, by His own divine power, and according to His own divine way, His divine wisdom.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE THREE MAIN ITEMS OF GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE FOR THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:17-21; Eph. 3:10-11; 1:10, 22-23; John 1:4; 8:12; Rev. 21:11, 23-24; 22:1-2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TO HAVE THE DIVINE SONSHIP IN FULL<br />
THROUGH SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Freedom of the Glory of the Children of God</h2>
<p>Romans 8:17-19 says, &ldquo;If children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed upon us. For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God.&rdquo; Today there are many sons of God. There may be many thousands in Los Angeles alone, but they are not yet revealed. The revelation, the manifestation, of the sons of God is the very glorification mentioned in verse 17. Not only God but even the whole creation, all things, are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;For the creation was made subject to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it.&rdquo; All creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because the creation was made subject to vanity. Verse 21 continues, &ldquo;In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&rdquo; Here we have the words <em>vanity, slavery,</em> and <em>corruption</em>. These are not good words. The whole creation is in the slavery of corruption, so it is in vanity, waiting for a deliverance.</p>
<p>How can the creation be delivered from this vanity, slavery, and corruption? The Brethren, for example, saw the truth of the creation being in vanity, slavery, and corruption, but they mainly saw the objective prophecy that when all the sons of God will be manifested, the whole universe will be released. They did not see the subjective way, the process, of deliverance. We believe that in these last days the Lord will show us not merely the prophecy but the way in which all the creation will be delivered into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Glory of the Children of God Being<br />
the Goal of the Sufferings of This Present Time</h2>
<p>Verse 21 speaks not of the freedom of the children of God but the freedom of the glory of the children of God. Again here is a difficult utterance. With the glory of the children of God there is the freedom. The manifestation of the children of God is the very glory of the children of God. Romans 8:19 tells us that the whole creation is waiting for the glory of the sons of God, and Hebrews 2:10 says that Christ is leading many sons into glory. If you would ask me what God is doing today, I would say that He is doing one thing: He is bringing us into glory. We may compare this to the preparation of a feast. If we come to a brother&rsquo;s home for a big feast, we may ask, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Then someone will say, &ldquo;He is in the kitchen cooking.&rdquo; Today God is &ldquo;in the kitchen cooking&rdquo; to bring His many sons into glory.</p>
<p>Romans 8:18 speaks of the sufferings of this present time and the coming glory. It is through these sufferings that God is &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; us. The objective teaching concerning suffering and glory is that God will reward us one day with glory because we pay the price by suffering today. This is too objective. Naturally, we are like raw beef. How can a piece of raw beef become a delicious steak? It is by cooking. While the beef is being cooked, it suffers. We need to undergo the process of God&rsquo;s cooking. An ugly caterpillar does not simply sleep well, have a good dream, and wake up the next morning transformed into a beautiful butterfly. Rather, being in the cocoon is a suffering process that the caterpillar must undergo.</p>
<p>On many occasions in the past, people have asked me, &ldquo;If God loves the people on the earth, why are there so many afflictions?&rdquo; The reason is that God is cooking us today. While a sister is cooking, boiling, and baking, someone may ask, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love all those items? If you love them, why are you cutting them, pounding them, and baking them? Why are you giving them so many afflictions?&rdquo; She does this in order to make something delicious out of something raw. The whole universe is a big kitchen, and God is the cook preparing a delicious &ldquo;steak&rdquo; for Himself. For the sake of His cooking, He has to sacrifice something. He has to kill and cut something. If God truly loves you, then one day He will &ldquo;cut&rdquo; you and &ldquo;heat you in an oven.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Many Sons Being Brought into Glory<br />
in the Economy of the Fullness of the Times</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 speaks of the economy of the fullness of the times. If we ask a sister what she is doing in the kitchen, she will say, &ldquo;Please sit there patiently and wait for half an hour. Then you will know what I am doing here.&rdquo; The cooking sister has her economy, her dispensation, and the end of the half hour will be the &ldquo;fullness of the times&rdquo; for her economy. In the Far East a feast may have eighteen courses and two or three desserts. For one big feast, the Chinese may prepare for several months. This is the economy of their feast. They may collect some items from the south and something else from the north. Then for several days they will work out their economy in the kitchen. While they are working out their economy, the kitchen is a big mess, and everything seems to be in disorder. After the cooking, however, when the fullness of the times comes, we will see the many beautiful courses of the feast. This is a small illustration of the economy of the fullness of the times.</p>
<p>Today is the time of cooking. The fullness of the times has not yet come. When the fullness of the times comes, all things will be in order. For now, though, God is &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; the church, including you and me. Then at the fullness of the times, we all will be brought into glory. At that time the whole creation will be released, delivered, from the slavery of corruption and from vanity, and all creation will be headed up in Christ with His Body.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church Being the Vessel<br />
to Fulfill God&rsquo;s Purpose and to Solve His Problems</h2>
<p>The church is the means and the vessel God uses today to fulfill His purpose and solve all His problems. The preaching in Christianity tells people, &ldquo;We are poor, sinful persons who will perish, so we need God&rsquo;s mercy and grace. God is merciful and full of grace to us, so He sent His Son to save us from hell. Now we are the beloved ones, and when God puts us together, we are the church.&rdquo; This is correct, but it is too poor and shallow. This is mainly what we heard concerning the church in the past. According to the revelation of the Word, however, the church is much deeper and higher than this. The church is the very vessel used by God to fulfill His purpose and to solve all His problems.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose and intention in creating the many human beings is to make these men a Body as a vessel to contain Him that He may dwell in them and manifest Himself through them by mingling Himself with them. This is God&rsquo;s purpose on the positive side. However, because one day Satan came in, God now has a problem, and He has an enemy. Then death followed Satan, and where death is, there is darkness. Following darkness there is confusion. If we had no light in this room, the whole room would be in confusion. Light is a controlling power. We are constantly, unconsciously controlled by light. If there were no light, we could still do things, but we would do them in confusion. Where there is light, however, we do things under the control of the light.</p>
<p>When Satan came in, he injected himself into the human race to affect and influence the whole creation. Then death came into the human race, and darkness and confusion followed. Now there is death, darkness, and confusion in the whole of creation. The entire creation is subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption. This corruption in the whole of creation came from darkness, darkness came from death, and death came from Satan. This is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. By this we can see that God has a purpose to fulfill, and He has an enemy and many problems&mdash;death, darkness, confusion, corruption, slavery, and vanity in His creation. Now God must do something for His creatures, because Satan has damaged them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Sonship Being Accomplished<br />
by Our Being Mingled with God<br />
unto Full Sanctification</h2>
<p>God is working Himself into us and mingling Himself with us so that we may be holy, absolutely sanctified by Him, in Him, and with Him. Every bit of our human nature will be mingled with the divine nature. In the Old Testament type, every part of the boards of the tabernacle was overlaid with gold. In the fulfillment of the type, God mingles Himself with the church so that we may be brought into full sonship.</p>
<p>According to the teaching of the New Testament, sonship first means that we are born of God to have God as our life and nature. Second, it means that we grow up with God and in God, and third, it means that we are absolutely mingled with God; every part of our being will be permeated, saturated, overlaid, and absolutely mingled with God. Fourth, we are qualified to inherit all that God is, all that God has, and all that God has purposed. Fifth, we eventually are absolutely sanctified, holy, and divine. This is the proper meaning of sonship. Sonship implies a birthright, qualifying us to enjoy God by being mingled with Him. By being mingled with Him we are absolutely, thoroughly sanctified by Him, with Him, and in Him; within and without we are made holy and divine. God&rsquo;s purpose is to have the church sanctified to such an extent. This is the first item of God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO SUBDUE AND DEFEAT GOD&rsquo;S ENEMY<br />
BY DISPLAYING HIS MANIFOLD WISDOM<br />
THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The second aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is to subdue and defeat His enemy by displaying His multifarious wisdom through the church (Eph. 3:10-11). The more trouble the enemy causes, the more God will display His wisdom to him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO HEAD UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST<br />
THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The third aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is that He will head up all things in Christ through the church. Although this aspect of the church in God&rsquo;s economy is revealed in the Word of God, many Christians have not seen it. For this reason, we need to study several verses concerning this matter. Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; <em>Economy,</em> or <em>dispensation,</em> and <em>the fullness of the times</em> are difficult phrases to understand and may seem strange to us. However, they help us to realize that what is spoken here is very important.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Center, the Hub, and the Head</h2>
<p>In the King James Version this verse says that &ldquo;He might gather together into one all things.&rdquo; This is better translated as &ldquo;to head up all things,&rdquo; as in Darby&rsquo;s New Translation. <em>Head up</em> in the Greek text is one word, not a phrase, the root of which is the word <em>head,</em> used as a verb. Without a head, the universe is in confusion. We are all headed up by our head. Because the head is upon the body, we may think that the body holds up the head. However, this is wrong. If we cut off the head, the body will fall. This proves that it is the head that holds up the body. To cut off the head brings confusion and death to the whole body.</p>
<p>All things are to be headed up in Christ. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is the center, the hub, to be the Head. If all things are put under His headship, then all things are headed up; that is, they are gathered together into one.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Head over All Things to the Church</h2>
<p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; <em>Subjected</em> and <em>gave</em> indicate completed actions. We have to join this verse to verse 10. Verse 10 says that all things will be headed up in Christ, and verse 22 says that at the time God raised Christ from the dead and lifted Him to the heavens in ascension, He put all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet and gave Him to be the Head over all things. In writing this passage, Paul referred to Psalm 8:6, which says, &ldquo;You have put all things under His feet,&rdquo; and he quoted from this Psalm again in Hebrews 2:8.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 says that Christ is Head over all things &ldquo;to the church,&rdquo; not &ldquo;for the church.&rdquo; This phrase requires our proper study. We need to differentiate between <em>to the church</em> and <em>for the church.</em> If Christ being the Head were only for the church, there would be no identification of the church with Christ, no identification of the Body with the Head. The little word <em>to</em>signifies the identification and oneness of the church with Christ. Christ is the Head over all things, not only for the Body but also to the Body.</p>
<p>Verse 23 continues, &ldquo;Which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; Again, all these words and phrases may be strange to us, and we may easily forget them. If we would try reciting some of the phrases in verses 10, 22, and 23, we will see how difficult they are. <em>To head up all things in Christ, subjected all things under His feet, gave Him to be Head over all things, to the church,</em> and <em>His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all</em> are not ordinary utterances. Who could believe that there is such a language as this upon the earth? To truly know the meaning of these words is not easy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Death Coming into Creation<br />
by Satan&rsquo;s Injection into Man,<br />
Bringing In Darkness and Confusion</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose with the church is to put all things in a divine order under the headship of Christ. When He accomplishes this, His desire will be fulfilled, the enemy will be destroyed and cut off, and all creation will be in a proper order to enjoy the headship of Christ. This will be accomplished in the fullness of the times. God must do something to deliver His creation from the slavery of corruption, vanity, and confusion and bring the confused, damaged creation into an order full of freedom. This is to head up all things under the headship of Christ. The way God works this out is very deep.</p>
<p>God told Adam and Eve, &ldquo;But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17). Satan brought confusion into the creation by injecting himself into the human race as death. Death is simply Satan. Just as God is the sum total of life, Satan is the sum total of death. When Satan injected himself into the human race, death came into man. Then darkness and confusion came in through death.</p>
<p>The world today is very much in confusion. Every day when I read the newspaper, I say, &ldquo;Look how pitiful the world is. Day by day there is so much confusion.&rdquo; There is confusion in Africa, in Vietnam, in Indonesia, and even in the United States. There is no harmony. The United Nations itself is the very base of confusion; it is a &ldquo;beehive&rdquo; of confusion. The nations there are always fighting, debating, arguing, and in confusion. They are in darkness. All the politicians, professors, and philosophers also are in confusion, because they too have no light. They are in darkness because they are fully under the sway of death. They are full of death and under death, so they are in darkness. Because they have no light, they even consider their kind of confusion to be glorious; those who bring in more confusion become more famous. Satan has damaged the creation of God by injecting confusion into it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Way of Recovering His Creation<br />
Being to Impart Life into Man,<br />
Bringing In the Light of Life</h2>
<p>Now God must recover His creation. The way He does this is by imparting Himself into us. Satan injected himself into us as death, but now God is imparting Himself into us as life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,&rdquo; and in 8:12 the Lord Jesus told the people, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; When God comes into us as life, He shines within us as the light of life. This life swallows death, and the light chases away darkness. When we are in life and under the light, we are delivered out of confusion into order, harmony, and oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life and Light Bringing In<br />
Harmony, Order, and Oneness</h2>
<p>On the one hand, there is Satan, death, darkness, and confusion. On the other hand, there is God, Christ, life, light, harmony, order, and oneness. When we are filled with Christ, we are full of life, and we are wholly under the light; then we have harmony and oneness. If the brothers who live together are not filled with Christ as life, at least to some extent they will be under darkness and in confusion. They can never have harmony in this condition. However, if they all are filled with Christ as life, they will be under the light. Then there will be no need to organize or arrange their situation. Spontaneously under the light of life, they will all be controlled, and there will be harmony and oneness.</p>
<p>Before Satan came in, there was oneness and harmony in God&rsquo;s creation. When Satan came, however, he injected death as the factor of confusion into the creation. Through death darkness came in, and under darkness everything is confused. In today&rsquo;s society, homes, and families, there is much confusion. Everything is confused and upside down. In God&rsquo;s redemption, His way to recover His creation is not the same way as He took in His creation. In creation, God created all things by His power, His mighty hand. In redemption, however, God recovers everything not by His hand and power but by Himself as life coming into us. That is why it seems that God is not doing anything in the present confusion. God is so quiet that it may seem that there is no God. However, we do know that there is a God who is working in a silent but living way. He is putting Himself into some of the confused people as life. Then when we receive Him as life into us, He is the very light, and we are controlled under this light. Spontaneously under this control we have oneness.</p>
<p>Although we are still in the fallen creation, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we do not make trouble wherever we go. This is not merely because we are under the control of the government or the police. It is because we are under the light of life. There is something living within us that shines all the time. Under this light we are controlled day by day in a nice, happy, and joyful way. We do not like to cheat people; if we cheat people, there is no joy within us. Rather, we like to be fair with people and treat them nicely. We are under the light because we have the life, so spontaneously there is a harmony within us. This harmony comes from light, the light comes from life, and this life is God Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">The Building Up of the Church<br />
Being by Our Experience of Christ as Life,<br />
Bringing In Oneness and Harmony<br />
under the Control of the Light of Life</h2>
<p>The building up of the church includes oneness and harmony. This harmony can be realized only by life. Therefore, the church must be built up through our experience of Christ as life. Then in this life we will have light, and under this light spontaneously every one of us will be controlled and will be one. We cannot simply adopt a saying, &ldquo;Let us build up a New Testament church.&rdquo; It is not adequate merely to come together to study the New Testament and learn certain matters from the four Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation to work out a formula for the scriptural way, the New Testament way, to have a proper church. We can never work out the building up of the church in this way. We may have the formula, but we will not have the life. We will not know how to be filled with Christ, live by Him, take Him as our life, experience Him, and be dealt with by the cross. In this case, even if we have a scriptural formula, we still will fight with one another. Merely to have a formula does not work.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, that by the mercy of God our eyes have been opened to see that God&rsquo;s economy is to work Himself into us as life, that we have to love Him, take Him as life, fellowship with Him, be filled with Him, and live by Him. Then spontaneously within us and among us there will be light. There will be no arguments, division, fighting, or jealousy. There will be only the oneness under the control of the light of life. We will have oneness, and this oneness will be the real building up. By this oneness, that is, by this building, God will head up all things in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All Creation Being Brought into Order<br />
under the Shining of the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is composed with many members, represented by the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:12, 14), but they all are one. Do you think Peter and John will argue in the New Jerusalem? All the arguing, debating, and fighting will have been swallowed up by life and light. Death will be entirely swallowed up, and all darkness will be chased away by light. Therefore, everyone in the New Jerusalem will be wholly in oneness.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is full of life. There is the water of life flowing and satisfying, and there is the tree of life growing and supplying (22:1-2). Therefore, the holy city is also full of light. God Himself is the light, and Christ the Lamb is the lamp (21:23). What then will be the condition of the creation? Verse 24 says, &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light.&rdquo; All the nations, representing all of creation, will be controlled by the shining of the city; therefore, all nations will have order.</p>
<p>Today in Los Angeles there are millions of people. Physically speaking, they are walking under the sun by day and under electrical light by night, but spiritually speaking, they are walking in darkness. The first time I came to the United States in 1958, I was surprised to see the lights on in the stores after they were locked for the night. I said, &ldquo;This is a waste. Don&rsquo;t these people know how to save electricity?&rdquo; Gradually I came to understand that the lights are left on in the stores to prevent robberies. If all the lights in the stores and on the street were turned off, there would be robberies under darkness every night. If the electricity in Los Angeles were turned off for only one night, the newspapers would not be big enough to report all the confusion that would take place.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem the nations will walk in the light of the holy city. Is there such a holy city today? No, there is not, but God is going to work out such a city. This is the age in which God is working to save people and build them up to produce the New Jerusalem as the universal lampstand that holds Christ as the lamp with God within Him as the light. God will shine on all creation through this universal lampstand, and by this shining, this enlightening, God will bring all things into order.</p>
<p>Consider the picture of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. In the center and at the top of the city Christ is sitting as the Head to supply His life to all His members. His members are enlightened, and they become the vessel from which He shines out. By this shining all the nations, representing all the creatures, will be brought into order. They will all be under the headship of Christ. The whole universe will be headed up in the light. Within the city there is life, and this life is the very God who is ministered and imparted to all His members. Strictly speaking, though, this life does not come out from the city. Rather, out from the city comes the shining light. The creation, the nations, will not have life, but they will be under the shining of the light. We will enjoy God as our life. Then we will be full of light, and this light will shine through us upon all the creation to bring the creation out of darkness, confusion, the slavery of corruption, and vanity. All creation will be brought into the order of the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Carrying Out His Process<br />
until the Fullness of the Times</h2>
<p>One hundred years ago the church did not see this truth in a subjective way. At that time the Brethren thought that the fullness of the times would arrive suddenly. Today the Lord has shown us that this is not so. There is the need of a process. In 1936, after we first received this light, Mussolini was still living. Many students of the prophecies in the Scriptures predicted that he was the Antichrist. Even D. M. Panton, the editor of the magazine <em>The Dawn,</em> published pictures of Nero and Mussolini side by side, trying to prove that Mussolini was the Antichrist. When we read that article, we realized that this could not be true. We knew that Christ would not return at that time. The fullness of the times had not come, because the harvest was not yet ripe (Matt. 13:30; Rev. 14:15). At that time God&rsquo;s &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; was only partly finished. If we come into a kitchen and see things in a mess, we know that we have to wait for another few hours. We cannot expect that a minute later we will have a feast. There is the need for more time.</p>
<p>God has a process to carry out. He has much work to do in the church. He needs to work Himself into you, me, and every one of us as life, that we may be full of light and be controlled by this light. Then we will have the oneness, the harmony, and this will be the real building up. It is by this building that God will shine out and shine upon all creation to bring them out of confusion, the slavery of corruption, and vanity. That time will be the fullness of the times. It will be the time that all creation will be liberated, because death will have been swallowed up. After the ancient serpent is cast into the lake of fire, death will also be cast in (20:10, 14). Death will be the last enemy to be dealt with by God (1 Cor. 15:26, 54). After death is dealt with, the universe will be full of light. Under this light all creation will be freed from the slavery of corruption. All creation will be liberated from vanity and brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God, which is the shining of the New Jerusalem. The shining of the New Jerusalem is the manifestation, the glory, of the sons of God. All the nations will be brought into this shining, and they will walk in this light and be controlled by this light. There will be no more confusion, so there will be no more vanity and slavery of corruption. Creation will be completely released from the slavery of corruption and will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the holy city.</p>
<p>All this depends on the work of God within and through us. God must work out this city as a corporate vessel that He may be life in every way to us and shine through us as light upon the whole creation. Then the whole creation will be delivered, liberated from confusion. Oh, how important it is that the church be built up! Without this vessel, that is, without the built-up church, God can never head up all things. It is by His being life to the church and by the church being built up through this life that God shines out as the controlling factor, and it is by this shining that all creation will be brought back to God, released from confusion, and brought into the liberty which is under the shining of the sons of God.</p>
<p>At that time Christ will be the Head to head up all things under His headship through the church. Christ will be at the top of the holy city as life and light. Under this light and in this light the nations, representing the whole universe, will be controlled. Then all things will be in order. God&rsquo;s desire will be satisfied, and we also will be satisfied. God&rsquo;s enemy will be cast out, and all His problems will be settled. Moreover, all creation will be brought back, released from all bondage, and brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God. All these things will be fulfilled through the church at the fullness of the times.</p>
<p>I do not have the adequate utterance to speak all these great matters to you in the fullest way. However, I trust the Lord that He will show you all these things so that you may see what the church is in a high and deep way, not in a low and shallow way. We must not say that we are merely poor people to whom God has been merciful; that He has saved us and put us together as the church; that we are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming to bring us into the glorious kingdom; and that if we die before that time, we will be taken into heaven. It seems that there is nothing wrong with this teaching and theology, but it is too low. Rather, today God is working Himself into us as life. Therefore, we need to be cooked, dealt with, and we need to be permeated and saturated with God. Then we will be full of light, and under this light we will be controlled, we will have oneness and harmony, we will be built up, and we will become the universal vessel through which God will head up all things under the shining of His Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE THREE MAIN ITEMS OF GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE FOR THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:4-5; 3:9-11; 1:10, 21-23; Rom. 8:19-21; Rev. 22:1-2; 21:23-24</h1>
<p>I am still burdened to speak about God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church. In my spirit is a realization that we are not deeply enough impressed with this matter. Perhaps many of us have a little understanding, but we may not have been brought into a full realization. Moreover, we should be able to speak the things we have heard and minister what we have been impressed with.</p>
<p>As we said in the previous messages, there are three main items of God&rsquo;s purpose for the church. The first is that the church must have the full sonship (Eph. 1:4-5). The second is that God may show His wisdom to the enemy through the church (3:9-11). Third, God&rsquo;s purpose is to head up all things in Christ through the church (1:10, 21-23). This utterance is brief, clear, effective, and full. In studying the book of Ephesians, the verses cited above are the most difficult verses for people to understand. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s purpose with the church is in these verses. If we do not know these verses, we are blind concerning the main items of God&rsquo;s purpose for the church. The sonship, God&rsquo;s wisdom made known, and the heading up of all things are the three main items of God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SONSHIP BEING<br />
OUR FULL SANCTIFICATION BY GOD MINGLING WITH US</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us, to absolutely and thoroughly mingle Himself with us. The way for God to work Himself into us and thoroughly mingle with us is by being our life and our life supply. Therefore, we first need to be born of Him. By this divine birth, the second birth, we become the children, the sons, of God. By being the sons of God, we have the life and nature of God. Our new birth is the beginning of the mingling of God with us.</p>
<p>As sons of God, however, we need growth. Our human spirit is the base of the divine work of the Triune God; it is the abode that God first takes within us. From the very center of our being&mdash;our spirit as the base for God&rsquo;s work&mdash;God spreads Himself to our soul to transform all the parts of the soul. Eventually He transforms, transfigures, our physical body. In this way, our whole being will be saturated by God Himself, permeated by His essence. Our whole being will be transformed and mingled with God to be wholly sanctified (1 Thes. 5:23). To be made holy is to be thoroughly overlaid with God, that is, thoroughly mingled with God. Within every part of our being there will be the essence of God. The essence of God, God Himself, is holiness. When we are thoroughly mingled with God, we are wholly sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sanctification Consummating<br />
in the Manifestation of the Children of God,<br />
the Full Sonship</h2>
<p>When we are thoroughly sanctified, we will be glorified. This means that our whole being will be brought into the essence of God. To be glorified means that we are fully matured. In this way we will have the manifestation, the full maturity, of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19-21). This will be our full sonship. Sonship begins from the new birth and consummates in glorification and the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<p>Sonship is a matter of the new birth, growth, and sanctification. In an all-inclusive sense, sanctification includes regeneration in the spirit, transformation for the soul, and transfiguration of the body. These three things&mdash;regeneration, transformation, and transfiguration&mdash;together are complete sanctification (1 Thes. 5:23). In this way our whole being, from the center to the circumference, is wholly sanctified. The end of this sanctification is glorification, and glorification is the manifestation of the children of God. Today we are the children of God, but we do not yet have the manifestation of the children of God because we are not yet glorified, and we are not yet glorified because we are not fully sanctified. This is because our soul has not been transformed, and our body has not been transfigured. At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, our body will be transfigured (Phil. 3:21). Then there will be no need to tell people that we are the sons of God. Everyone will recognize that we are sons of God, because we will have the manifestation, which is glorification, as the end of our sanctification.</p>
<p>Regeneration is the new birth, after which come transformation and finally transfiguration. Included in this complete sanctification we have glorification, and with this glorification we have the manifestation of the sons of God. Then at the manifestation of the sons of God, we will have the full sonship. Sonship begins with regeneration and consummates with the manifestation of the sons of God. When we have the full sonship, whatever God is, whatever God has, and whatever God has accomplished will be ours. We will have the full sonship, and we will be fully in God Himself according to God&rsquo;s plan. This is very clear in the Scriptures.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Full Sonship Requiring a Process<br />
That Includes Suffering</h2>
<p>We should spend more time considering the meaning of sonship in the New Testament. Sonship includes our becoming a child of God by the new birth all the way to the manifestation of the sons of God. From regeneration to the manifestation of the sons of God there is a process for us to undergo. Many things are involved in this process. If we consider the process itself, we will see a mess. We have compared this process to preparing a feast. Preparing a feast includes shopping in the supermarket all the way to serving the many courses. Between these two points there is a process, and the main part of the process is a mess in which the cook kills, cuts, scrapes, and mashes. We may also compare this process to cutting hair, which requires a number of instruments and also seems to make a mess.</p>
<p>In the early years of my ministry, whenever I saw troubles in the church among the children of God, I was sorry and disappointed. Today, however, if a brother has a failure, we can praise the Lord. Are there any problems? Praise the Lord for the problems! We need them. Without them nothing &ldquo;delicious&rdquo; will be cooked. The &ldquo;potatoes&rdquo; have to be &ldquo;mashed.&rdquo; We have to suffer and undergo many things. We may be sorry over the situation today, but the Lord is never sorry. He is happy, because He knows what He is doing. He is doing the cooking work. One day, sooner or later, He will have the full sonship among His children, and He will have their manifestation in glory.</p>
<p>The problem is that if we do not cooperate well with Him, we will delay Him and prolong the process. However, He is still wise. The more we prolong the time, the better He will do the cooking. I am not saying, &ldquo;Let us do evil that good may come.&rdquo; God is wise. He is wiser than we know. We all have to realize that we are under the process. We already have received the new birth, and now the goal in front of us is sanctification, glorification, full sonship, and the manifestation of the sons of God. If we cooperate with Him, we will hasten the time. If not, we will prolong the time a little. However, to the Lord it is the same. Eventually He will work it out. Eventually the whole universe will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; And the One on the throne will declare, &ldquo;Behold, I make all things new&rdquo; (Rev. 21:5). For the sons of God to be new is for them to be matured.</p>
<p>The correct, full meaning of sonship spans the new birth to maturity, from regeneration to glorification. If this will impress us and we are clear about this, the Scriptures will be open to us. Then our reading of the New Testament will be different from what it was in the past. God predestinated us unto this sonship, which starts from the new birth and consummates with maturity. I hope that from this time we all could be clear about this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUBDUING THE ENEMY BY MAKING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S WISDOM KNOWN THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:26). This image is related to the sonship; the sonship is the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s image. It is by the sonship that eventually we will fully be in the image of God. By the new birth we have the image of God within our spirit, and by transformation our soul will be conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). Then by transfiguration even our physical body will be conformed to the full likeness of Christ. At that time we will have the likeness, the image, of God fully and thoroughly, from within to without (1 John 3:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Purpose Being Not Only<br />
That Man Bear God&rsquo;s Image<br />
but Also That He Deal with His Enemy</h2>
<p>In His creation of man, God also committed His authority to man in order to subdue and deal with His enemy (Gen. 1:26). Therefore, the second item of God&rsquo;s purpose with the church is related to the second aspect of God&rsquo;s creation of man. God&rsquo;s creation of man was first for man to be in His image and second to have His authority to deal with His enemy. The church was predestinated for the sonship of God and also was destined to subdue the enemy. In subduing the enemy, the church will make the wisdom of God manifest to all God&rsquo;s enemies (Eph. 3:10).</p>
<p>The serpent first appears in Genesis 3, and he will be cast out in Revelation 20. Before Genesis 3 there are two chapters at the beginning of the entire Scripture, and after Revelation 20 there are two chapters at the end, but in between there is a long record. On the positive side, this record is full of many good stories concerning the sonship. On the negative side, there are also many victorious stories related to subduing and overcoming the enemy. Finally, in Revelation 20 the ancient serpent will be bound and cast out (vv. 2-3, 10).</p><h2 class="head2">Every Defeat Being a Preparation<br />
for the Universal Victory</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly and thoroughly reveals that what God has been doing in the past generations, still is doing now, and will be doing in the future is to fully accomplish His sonship in us and to subdue the enemy, to cast out the serpent. This will be done through the church and by the church. At present, as regards the sonship, we are under a process, and as regards the subduing of the enemy, we are in a battle. We are not only in a process but also in a battle, fighting all the time. Sometimes we are defeated; there is no doubt about this. In fighting sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose. However, do not be discouraged. Sometimes a defeat is for the purpose of a future victory. That is why I said that in the early days when I saw someone defeated, I was sorry, but today when I see someone defeated, I say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! This is the preparation for a further victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually we will not be defeated. We will be victorious. Victory will be ours, not the enemy&rsquo;s. I have this assurance. Do you think that eventually Satan will be victorious? No, we who are in Christ will be victorious. Do you believe in defeat, or do you believe in victory? In the past years many dear ones have come to me to argue, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we never see you feeling sorrowful. You always look happy. This is too extreme.&rdquo; I told these ones, &ldquo;If you argue for feeling sorrowful, you eventually will lose the case. If you do not lose it today, you will lose it tomorrow. If you do not lose it in this generation, you will lose in the next generation. If you do not lose it in this age, I am sure you will lose it in eternity. When Revelation 21 comes, you will lose the case for feeling sorrowful.&rdquo; There is no need for us to be sorrowful. We should always be happy and praising the Lord. Even a defeat is a preparation for a further victory. Let the enemy try to defeat us; eventually he will be defeated.</p>
<p>What kind of Bible do you have? You need to say, &ldquo;I have a Bible of victory.&rdquo; This is a book of victory, not a book of defeat. How many books of the Bible do you have? Do you have only sixty-five books, without Revelation? You may show me what is mentioned in 2 Timothy 4 regarding the decline of the church, but I would say, &ldquo;Look at Revelation.&rdquo; Again you may show me the poor condition of the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, but there are not only three chapters in Revelation; there are twenty-two. Go on from chapter 3 until you get to chapter 21. At that time the universal Hallelujah will come out. The whole universe will cry, &ldquo;Hallelujah, victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within this Bible are the Old and the New Testaments. A testament is something that is accomplished and given to us as a will. We simply accept it. Our victory is an item of the testament. In the eyes of the Lord, Satan has been defeated already. This is a matter of fact; it is a settled matter. If we have this foresight and insight, then day by day we will sing Hallelujah. With the church there is no difference between a defeat and a victory. Even a defeat is for a victory. We must tell Satan, &ldquo;Satan, even your victory is a preparation for our victory. We can never be defeated. Eventually you will be the one who is defeated. I do not care how much you attack and how much you damage. The Lord Jesus said in John 2:19, &lsquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rsquo; The more you destroy, the more the Lord will build up. Your destroying is just a preparation for His building up.&rdquo; We need the vision of how much the Lord will use the church to defeat His enemy and to subdue and recover the whole earth. One day this will be accomplished.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEADING UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST<br />
THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The third item of God&rsquo;s purpose for the church is to head up all things in Christ. This is the greatest item. The first item of God&rsquo;s purpose is the sonship, for the church positively. The second item, the subduing of the enemy, is for the enemy negatively. The third item, to head up all things in Christ, is for all the creation universally. The church must have the sonship, Satan must be subdued and cast out, and the whole creation must be headed up. When all creation is headed up, it will be delivered from vanity and from the slavery of corruption, and it will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God. These three main items&mdash;one for the church, one for the enemy, and one for the whole creation&mdash;are truly great matters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Today All Creation Being under Satan&rsquo;s Damage</h2>
<p>The phrase <em>to head up all things in Christ</em> is truly wonderful. All the things in God&rsquo;s creation were right, but the enemy of God came in and injected himself into the creation. Then death, darkness, and confusion came in, and the whole of creation was brought into vanity under the slavery of corruption. Therefore, even up to this time the whole creation is groaning. This is the situation under Satan&rsquo;s damage in the whole universe. That even the little mosquitoes bite us illustrates the damage in creation. There will be no need for pest control in the fullness of the times. Today, however, the whole universe is damaged by Satan, because he brought in death, darkness, and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Recovery of His Creation<br />
Being by Life and Light</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s way to recover His creation is the way of life. Satan injected himself into creation, bringing in death, darkness, and confusion, but now God has imparted Himself into us as life. Since God has come in, life follows, and light follows life. Under the light there is the proper regulation, which brings in harmony and oneness. First there was Satan, death, darkness, and confusion. Now we have Christ, life, light, and harmony. How can the whole creation be delivered out of vanity and corruption? It is only by God being life to us. When we have God in Christ as life to us, life becomes the shining light. Eventually the entire environment, the whole universe, will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:11, 23-24). Under the control of this light, the whole universe, the whole of creation, will be in harmony.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Jerusalem Being<br />
a City of Life and Light,<br />
by Whose Light All the Nations Will Walk</h2>
<p>We have the full picture of this situation in Revelation 21 and 22. At the top of the New Jerusalem, Christ is the Head with God in Him as the very content. From Him flows the river of life with the tree of life to supply all His sons, and the redeemed ones as the sons of God are filled with life (22:1-2). The whole city shines out this life as light, and the nations, representing the whole universe, walk in the light of this city. Because Christ is at the top of the city as the Head, all things are headed up in Christ through the Body, the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem. This picture is very clear. At that time the entire universe will be in a good harmony, and there will be no more death, thus no more darkness and no more confusion. Within, the city is full of life, and without, it is full of light. The whole environment surrounding the city will be under the regulation of this light. Then the whole universe will be headed up in Christ through the church. This will be the full manifestation of Christ being Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.</p>
<p>Have you seen this picture? This picture is often before me. Christ is at the top of the New Jerusalem as the Head, and from Him flows the bountiful life to supply us all. We are filled with this life, and spontaneously we shine out this life as light to the whole environment. Then all the surrounding nations, representing the entire universe, walk in this light and are controlled under this light. Thus, they will have the real harmony. All things will be headed up in Christ through the church. This is the consummation of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. At this time the sonship will be fully fulfilled, the enemy will be cast out, and all things will be headed up in Christ through the Body.</p>
<p>Even today this can be realized among us to some degree. When we know how to enjoy the sonship, how to defeat the enemy, and how to be filled with Christ under His headship, light shines out of us, and others are under the enlightening of this light. This is a foretaste and miniature of the coming consummation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH IN LIFE<br />
BY THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE MEMBERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:57; Eph. 4:11-16; Col. 2:19</h1>
<p>As we saw in the previous messages, God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church is revealed in three portions in Ephesians. We will review these again, because we need to be truly impressed with God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SONSHIP<br />
THROUGH GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>The first aspect is in Ephesians 1:5, which says that God predestinated, foreordained, us unto sonship. Included in sonship are birth, growth, and birthright. Birth plus growth and birthright equals sonship. These are not small matters; they all include many items.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Example of Jacob<br />
Enjoying the Birthright in His Maturity</h2>
<p>Jacob had the proper birth, but at first he did not have the birthright. Eventually he gained the birthright, but he did not enjoy the birthright until he had more growth of life, until he was transformed from a supplanter, a heel holder, into a prince of God. This transformation comes from the growth in life. Jacob&rsquo;s transformation took more than twenty years. When he was young, he was a true supplanter, a robber. He robbed his brother, and he robbed his uncle Laban. However, when he went down to Egypt, the supplanting hands of Jacob became the blessing hand of Israel (Gen. 47:7, 10; 48:15, 20; 49:28). Instead of supplanting, he blessed. He blessed even Pharaoh, the highest person on the earth. At that time the whole of Egypt was under his hand. He could have taken anything he liked, but he did not. Rather, he stretched out his hand to bless. He came down to Egypt not to snatch, supplant, or rob but to give and to bless. He was a truly matured man before God, so he enjoyed the birthright and the full sonship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Full Sonship Requiring<br />
Our Growth and Transformation in Life</h2>
<p>Sonship is a matter of life. We were predestinated unto sonship so that we may have God as our life, grow in this life, and have the full birthright in this life. The final step of our full sonship will be the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body (Rom. 8:23). In the New Testament, sonship simply means that God mingles Himself as life with the tripartite man. First God comes into our human spirit to regenerate us. This is the divine birth in our spirit. To be born of the Spirit in our spirit is to be born of God (John 3:6; 1:12-13). The divine birth is the beginning of life within us. Then from the time of our divine birth, if we open our heart&mdash;our mind, emotion, will, and conscience&mdash;the Lord will have more opportunity to fill us and spread from within us. This is our growth and transformation. The transformation of the soul is the real growth of life. It is also the real salvation of our souls (James 1:21) and is related to our reward. If we have the growth in life, we have transformation, and at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back He will give us the reward, which is the birthright.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12 warns us to be careful not to lose our birthright (vv. 15-17). We have the birthright, but we may lose it. At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, whether or not we enjoy the birthright depends on our growth and transformation. If today we live in our soul, in our self, and by sight, we do not have faith. On the other hand, if we forget our self, deny our soul, and live in the spirit, we have living faith, and the Lord will have the opportunity to fill us from within and spread Himself to saturate our soul. This is to transform our soul, and this is also to save and uplift the soul that we have denied. When the Lord transforms our soul, He uplifts it. When we meet a spiritual person who is transformed in his soul, we can realize that his mind, emotion, and will have been uplifted. Moreover, due to this growth and transformation, the Lord will grant us the birthright as a reward at His coming back.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Birthright of the Sons of God<br />
Including the Priesthood, the Kingship,<br />
and the Double Portion of the Land</h2>
<p>Many things are related to the birthright, including the priesthood, the kingship, and the inheritance of a double portion of the good land (Rev. 20:6, 4; Heb. 2:5-6). As the firstborn son of Jacob, Reuben should have had the birthright, but due to his sin, he lost his birthright (Gen. 49:3-4; 1 Chron. 5:1). The birthright was divided among three other sons of Jacob. The priesthood went to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10), the kingship went to Judah (Gen. 49:10), and the double portion of the land went to Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1-2).</p>
<p>We are saved to be kings and priests. Revelation 1:6 and 5:10 tell us that we are saved as kings and priests, and Hebrews 2:5-6 tells us that one day we will inherit the earth. To be kings and priests and to inherit the land are the birthright. Today we may experience this a little, but the full experience will be at the time the Lord returns. When the Lord comes back, He will grant the full birthright, including these three items, to the overcomers. The Lord will grant the overcomers to be the kings and priests and to inherit the whole earth. That will be a reward. However, those who have the divine birth but do not grow in life will lose the birthright at that time, because they will not be mature. They will need a certain period of time to finish growing. After the thousand years they will be fully grown, and in the new heaven and new earth they will enjoy the birthright. That will be too late to enjoy the birthright in the millennium, but it will not be too late to enjoy the birthright in eternity.</p>
<p>If the Lord were to return today and say to you, &ldquo;Come, be a king in My kingdom,&rdquo; you may say, &ldquo;Lord, You have come to the wrong person. I am not ready to be a king.&rdquo; Kingship requires maturity. As we have said, Jacob received the birthright, but he did not enjoy the birthright due to his lack of maturity. Later when he went down to see Pharaoh, he had matured, so spontaneously he was a king; he was Israel, the prince of God (Gen. 32:28). Jacob spontaneously enjoyed the birthright, and he exercised the birthright.</p><h2 class="head1">MAKING KNOWN TO THE RULERS<br />
AND THE AUTHORITIES IN THE HEAVENLIES<br />
THE MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; This is the display, the demonstration of God&rsquo;s wisdom to the rulers, the authorities, the forces of darkness, Satan and all his followers. The more life we have, the more built up we will be. Eventually we will be a display. This will be a real challenge to the enemy, a shame to him and a glory to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Such a Display of God&rsquo;s Wisdom<br />
Being Even for the Present Time<br />
on the Earth</h2>
<p>The enemy Satan is subtle. Today he causes many children of God to say, &ldquo;It is impossible to have the church built up on this earth. The built-up church must be something not on this earth but far away, not today but in the future.&rdquo; This thought is the subtlety of the enemy. Ephesians 3:10 is not only for the future. Rather, it includes something even in this present age on this earth. In many places the Lord must work out something that is a challenge to Satan. The Lord wants to say, &ldquo;Satan, look. Even in your territory, in the territory utilized and usurped by you, I am working to build up a vessel, a lampstand to shine Me out and to bring all things into order.&rdquo; The built-up church is a real display, challenge, and shame to Satan and a glory to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Built-Up Church Being the Goal of God<br />
and the Target of the Enemy</h2>
<p>If our eyes are truly opened, we will be ready to pay any price for this. We will tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing at any cost to be for the building up of the church in the place where I am.&rdquo; This is not a small matter; it is something very strategic. I know too well that the enemy is struggling over this strategic point. Satan would allow people even to be saved and to seek spirituality as long as they would not be built up. According to the sixty-six books of the Bible, the ultimate conclusion and goal of God&rsquo;s intention is a building. Satan knows this, so on the one hand, he strives to build up something of himself, and on the other hand, he does whatever he can to damage the real building of God.</p>
<p>This is why there is a real struggle here today. The brothers in the Far East, even today, have been much opposed and criticized simply because we stand for the church, the building. No one can criticize us for preaching the gospel or teaching the truth wrongly. The only point of criticism is that we stand here for the building up of the church. We have been suffering, and still we are suffering. All the evil reports about us are due only to this one matter. If we would drop the matter of the church and merely preach the gospel and help people to be spiritual, everyone will praise us. They will say, &ldquo;Those people are wonderful and broad-minded!&rdquo; However, once we pick up the matter of the church, right away our reputation is blackened. People find nothing wrong with us except that we care for the church. Because of this, every kind of criticism comes to us. Some say we are sectarian, narrow-minded, and small. Oh, the subtlety of the enemy! However, all these evil reports one day will become a diamond in our crown.</p>
<p>In the subtlety of the enemy, people in certain places have said even worse things to me. I simply answered, &ldquo;I want to stay this way until the end.&rdquo; I stress this matter because we all have to realize what God&rsquo;s goal today is. If we are men after God&rsquo;s heart, as David was, we have to seek His goal. I am not satisfied simply to see persons saved. I am not satisfied only to see the dear saints seeking the Lord and being spiritual. I will not be satisfied until I see a real building up among the saints. This is the goal of God and the target of the enemy. If we are standing for the church, we will become the target. However, regardless of how much we are criticized, if we are faithful to stand with God, we will be a blessing even to those who criticize us. Today they criticize us, but tomorrow they will preach what we preach. They will receive all the teachings and all the blessings that we minister, and they will help others with them. The only thing they will not preach, however, is the church. We have to realize that to care for the church is a blessing, and we have to suffer for others&rsquo; blessing. Our main aim is to have the building, and this building is a real display and challenge to the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEADING UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST<br />
THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Another aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church is seen in Ephesians 1:10: &ldquo;To head up all things in Christ.&rdquo; God created the heavens and the earth as the universe, and within this sphere or realm He created millions of creatures. At the center of His creation God created man as a vessel to contain Him. Before God could come into man, however, Satan, the enemy of God, came in and injected himself into man as the leading part of creation, particularly into man&rsquo;s body, by tempting man to use his body to take the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When man took the fruit of that tree, the fruit entered into his body. This is why Romans 5 through 8 speak of sin in the members of man&rsquo;s body. The apostle Paul said, &ldquo;Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me&rdquo; (7:17). Sin here is personified; it is something living because it can dwell, have dominion, and reign as a king over us. Moreover, with this sin there is the law of sin (8:2).</p>
<p>Satan injected himself into the human body. This brought in death, death brought in darkness, and confusion followed darkness. Sin, death, darkness, and confusion influenced the whole universe. Man as the head of creation was damaged, and this damage influenced the whole universe. This is why today even the little mosquitoes trouble us. We need pest control only because everything is upside down and confused. This is due to darkness; darkness comes from death, death comes from sin, and sin is the satanic life, Satan himself.</p>
<p>Now God has come in to impart Himself into man, specifically into his human spirit as life. Life is versus sin. When life comes, light follows, so light is versus darkness. &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). Following light there is order, which is versus confusion. When Christ comes into us as life, we have the light. Light brings in regulation, and under this regulation we have order, which is the building up under the headship of Christ. From the Triune God as life, the light shines, and under this shining light all things are brought into order under the headship of Christ. Eventually all things will be headed up in Christ. God has started this work, and He will now finish it. One day the New Jerusalem will be completed. Within the New Jerusalem will be God as life, filling the whole city, and this life will shine in and through the city upon all the rest of the creation.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:24 tells us that all the nations will walk by the light of the city. Christ is the Lamb to be the lamp in the center of the built-up holy city (v. 23). God is within Him as the light, and God in Christ shines through the transparent city. The city will be crystal clear and transparent. There will be no more clay or anything opaque, because every piece of clay will have been transformed into precious stone. This transformation to make us transparent will be the real salvation of our souls.</p>
<p>Because God shines in Christ through the city, all the nations will walk by the light of the city. This means that the shining light will bring all creation into order under the headship of Christ. By this time Satan will have been cast into the lake of fire. Furthermore, there will be no more sea, signifying that Satan and his evil followers will all be dealt with and will not be found in the new heaven and new earth (21:1). Satan, death, and darkness will all have been done away with. The Triune God will mingle Himself with the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed persons, and God as life will shine in them, through them, and upon all the rest of the creation to bring all creation into order under the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Thus, Christ as the Head to head up all things in Himself is the ultimate consummation of the sixty-six books of the Bible. However, never forget that His heading up of all things is through the Body and ultimately through the New Jerusalem. This is the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10. We must have the real experience of the sonship, which is the experience of life, and we must realize the headship of Christ. Then we will be built up, and we will have the proper order in the building.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE ASPECT AND THE BUILDING ASPECT<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Life Aspect Being<br />
the Mingling of God and Man</h2>
<p>By all of the above we can see clearly that in order to realize the church life, we first must know the real experience of Christ within us as our life. We need to experience Christ to such an extent that He is truly our life. This is a matter of the mingling of God and man. Some have criticized our use of the word <em>mingling,</em> asking, &ldquo;How can God mingle with us?&rdquo; These dear persons are too preoccupied by traditional theology. Whenever I hear others criticizing our messages, I am not subjective. I try to be objective to see their point of view and further consider what we are teaching. Many times I take the attitude that we could be wrong, and I check this teaching again. Even this morning I checked again whether or not something might be wrong with it. However, the Lord told me, &ldquo;Look at John 6:57: &lsquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; Can we eat something without it being mingled with us? If we eat a chicken, the chicken and we are joined together. Whatever we eat is digested and mingled with us. The Lord Jesus is the bread of life, and He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem has four sides, and on each side there are three gates (Rev. 21:13). This is not three plus four but three multiplied by four. The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number four signifies man as the leading one of all the creatures (Matt. 28:19; Ezek. 1:5, 10). These figures signify that the Triune God mingles with man. The first time I gave a message about this picture was in 1941 in my hometown. Now, because I have been criticized for this teaching, I went back to check with the writings of Brother Watchman Nee. In <em>The Glorious Church</em> Brother Nee speaks about four women: Eve in Genesis 2, the wife (the church) in Ephesians 5, the universal woman in the vision of Revelation 12, and the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 21 (<em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> Vol. 34, pp. 99 ff.). Brother Nee pointed out that these four women are actually one woman, signifying God&rsquo;s redeemed people composed together. Concerning the last woman, Brother Nee said, &ldquo;In the New Jerusalem, the union of God and man is no longer seven, but twelve. It is no longer three plus four, but three multiplied by four. Multiplication is a perfect union, something which can never be separated. When the Creator mingles with the creature, it is twelve, and twelve is the number of perfect union&rdquo; (p. 132). When Brother Nee spoke this message in Chinese, he used the word <em>mingle.</em></p>
<p>In order to have the church life, we must realize Christ as life to us, not merely in a general way but in the way of food to be digested by us. We must eat Christ and digest Him. &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; This is the word of the Lord in John 6:57, which we must never forget. We need to experience the Lord as life in the way of food to be digested by us, thus becoming our very constituent. Then spontaneously we are in a proper order under His headship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life and Building Being Found<br />
throughout the Entire Scripture</h2>
<p>The thought of life and building runs throughout the entire Scripture. In Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and there is also the building implied by the precious materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (vv. 9, 11-12). At the end of the Bible, in Revelation 21 and 22, there is again the tree of life and the building with precious materials (22:2; 21:18-21). In the seven parables in Matthew 13 there is also the thought of life and building. In these parables, the seed sown is the seed of life which grows to be wheat (vv. 3-8, 24). Even the mustard seed and the three measures of meal are related to life (vv. 31, 33). On the other hand, the treasure hidden in the earth and the pearl of great value are the precious materials for the building (vv. 44-46). Similarly, 1 Corinthians 3 tells us that, on the one hand, we are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, and on the other hand, we are the house of God (vv. 9-12, 16). As the cultivated land we need life to grow, and as the house we need to be built up. Throughout the entire Scripture we have these two matters&mdash;life and building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bridal Aspect and<br />
the Building Aspect of the Church</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament there are a number of types of the church. However, all the types are in two categories. The first category is the women. A number of women are types of the church. Eve is the first type of the church (Gen. 2:22; 3:20). Rebekah also is a type of the church (24:15, 64-67). Most of the positive women in the Old Testament are types of the church. The women are a matter of life. Eve came from Adam. She received her life from Adam, and Adam was life to her. This typifies that the church receives life from Christ, and Christ is life to the church. The second category of the types of the church is the house of God, the tabernacle, the temple, and even the city. All these are a matter of building.</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians contains both of these aspects. On the one hand, Ephesians tells us that we are the house, the dwelling place of God (2:20-22). On the other hand, it tells us that we are the wife, the counterpart of Christ (5:25, 32). As the counterpart we need to grow, and as the house we need to be built up. A single verse, Colossians 2:7, mentions both aspects. This verse says, &ldquo;Having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; To be rooted is a matter of life, and to be built up is a matter of building. Here again is life and building.</p><h2 class="head2">Growth in Life Being for the Building Up</h2>
<p>We need to grow, but merely to grow is not good enough. Growth is for the building. Although Christians today pay some amount of attention to the growth, they mostly neglect the matter of building. Ephesians 4:15 speaks of growth, and verse 16 speaks of building. These two verses say, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Similarly, Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; Ephesians 4:16 mentions the joints of the rich supply, and Colossians 2:19 speaks of the joints and sinews. Joints are for nourishment, the supply, and sinews are for knitting together.</p>
<p>We need to grow into Christ the Head in all things. If we do not grow into Christ, we cannot receive anything from Him, but the more we grow into Him, the more we receive something from Him to minister to others. In the Body the joints are the members of supply, the members of nourishment that supply nourishment to other members. In the Body some members are also the sinews to knit together. Without the sinews, all the members are scattered. It is by the sinews that all the members are joined.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
THROUGH THE FUNCTIONS OF ALL THE MEMBERS</h2>
<p>The verses mentioned above speak of four categories: the Head, the joints, the sinews, and all the other parts. First, we have Christ as the Head. We all have to grow into Him and receive something from Him as the Head, the source of supply. Second, there are the joints who receive the rich supply from the Head to minister to the other members. Third, there are the sinews, whose main ministry is not only to supply but to knit together. It is by them and through them that the many members are joined together. Fourth, Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Through the operation in the measure of each one part.&rdquo; Besides the Head, the joints, and the sinews, there are the many parts, the many members who are neither the Head, the joints, nor the sinews. The eyes, ears, nose, and hands are not joints or sinews, but they are parts of the body that have their operation. With every member there is the operation in its measure. We need to know the Head, Christ. We must learn to experience Him and grow into Him. Then we will receive something from Him. As we grow into Him and receive something from Him, we are in our function. It is by our function that the whole Body is built up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Head Building Up the Church<br />
through the Gifted Persons Indirectly</h2>
<p>Some people claim that according to Matthew 16 it is only the Lord Himself who can build His church. According to their thought, we are too proud when we say that we, the members, build up the church. This sounds good, but the Lord Jesus does not built up the church directly. He builds up the church through the gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11 and 12. These verses say, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; The Head does not build up the church directly. The Head builds up the church through the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Many Members<br />
Building Up the Church Directly</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, even the gifted persons do not build up the church directly. According to verse 12, they perfect the saints, and the saints build up the church. Verses 13 through 15 go on to speak of the growth, and verse 16 speaks of the building up. The real building up is by all the saints, that is, by all the members. The building up of the church is not directly by the gifted persons nor directly by the Head. The Head builds the church through the gifted persons, the gifted persons perfect the members, and the members themselves directly build up the church.</p>
<p>We can use cooking to illustrate the function of the gifted persons and all the members. If a brother&rsquo;s wife is not at home to cook for him, he may go hungry. Spiritually speaking, though, we all must be the &ldquo;cooks&rdquo; day by day. Even if we are not experts in cooking, we still have to cook. Sometimes we may have to invite an expert to teach us how to cook, but he should not replace us in cooking. The gifted persons should not replace the saints. No one should say to a gifted person, &ldquo;You are the expert. Please do the cooking for us.&rdquo; The expert should say, &ldquo;Since I am the expert, let me teach you how to cook. I will do the teaching; you will do the cooking. Do not expect that I will replace you as the cook. You have to do it. Perhaps I will do it for you once or twice to show you the way, but to be sure, the third time you will have to do it. Then, if you do not cook, you will not eat.&rdquo; This illustrates the way the gifted members perfect the saints so that the saints can build up the church directly. The church, the Body, is built up directly by the saints who are perfected through the ministry of the gifted persons.</p><h2 class="head2">The Different Kinds of Members<br />
Keeping the Order in the Body<br />
by Being Faithful in Their Own Functions</h2>
<p>As we have said, the members are of three main classes: the joints, the sinews, and all the other parts. The joints are for supply, for nourishment, the sinews are for knitting and uniting, and all the rest of the members are for the different kinds of operations. All these three classes of members must be under the headship of Christ. If we are joints, we must do our duty to supply and to nourish, and if we are sinews, we must be faithful to join the Body together in love. In the Body we need the joints to supply and the sinews to knit together. The joints cannot knit together; they are good only for nourishing and supplying. There is the need of a group of sinews to bind and knit together all the members. Many times the members need the supply, but after they are supplied, they need someone to join, knit, and bind them together. The problem today is that many want to be only the joints to supply but not the sinews to knit together. When this is the case, we have nourishment, but we are lacking the knitting. Even the more, we lack the many other operations of the members. For each kind of member to be faithful is the proper way to keep the order in the Body. We all agree that we must be under the headship, but we may not properly keep the order in the Body. If we are out of our function, we are out of the proper order. We may be a sinew that tries to supply or a joint that tries to knit together. If so, then we are out of our function and not in the proper order.</p>
<p>Many today talk about the &ldquo;Body ministry.&rdquo; At first I thought that this was a good term, but now I do not like to use it. When many people speak of the Body ministry, they are referring to meetings in which everyone opens his mouth to say something, as if the Body had only a mouth with no eyes, ears, nose, or other members. It is an ugly thing for the eyes of the Body to try to speak. The most beautiful situation is that the hands do the work of the hands, and the feet do the work of the feet. The Body ministry is not merely a speaking ministry. The genuine Body ministry is all the members of the Body functioning in various ways.</p>
<p>God created only one mouth in our body. If there were two mouths, they may quarrel with each other. On the one hand, 1 Corinthians 14:31 says that all can prophesy, so we must all prophesy properly. On the other hand, though, the foot should not function as the mouth. We may have the wrong sense as to whether or not we are the mouth, but the other members can discern. If the foot tries to function as the mouth, the members will sense that something is wrong. They may say, &ldquo;Brother, simply be a foot. That is sufficient. Do not try to be the mouth.&rdquo; The ministry of the Body is not that everyone speaks to function as the mouth. Rather, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 tell us that the Body has many members, and all the members do not have the same function (Rom. 12:3-5; 1 Cor. 12:14-17).</p>
<p>There is a certain brother among us through whom many people have been saved. He always realizes what and who he is, so he prepares a meal in his home and invites people, but he does not try to speak to them. Rather, along with the unbelievers he also invites certain brothers and sisters to speak. This is the proper coordination and cooperation of the differing operations. Even in gospel preaching we need this kind of coordination. If one person is a mouth but he cannot prepare a meal in his home, he needs the cooperation of the Body in order to preach the gospel. This is a small illustration of the proper ministry in the Body. The genuine Body ministry is the mouth speaking, the hands working, and all the members in their operation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Operation of the Members in the Proper Order<br />
Having a Living Effect on People</h2>
<p>We all are under the headship of Christ, but we need to learn to keep the order in the Body. If by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we know what we are and where we are, and we remain there, this will be a great help for the building up of the Body. There is no doubt that we all have the sincere desire to build up the church, but to do this we must keep the proper order. If we are the sinews, we have to keep this order; if we are the joints, we need to do our duty; and if we are one of the other members, we must operate within our measure. This will have a living effect on people. The main thing that impresses people is not our messages but the situation in our meetings. This is a matter of the true building up. This situation among us must be enriched, uplifted, strengthened, and improved. To this end we look to the Lord for His protection. The enemy is not willing to see the prevailing building up of the Body on this earth and in our locality. Nevertheless, the Lord will work this out. Then it will be very easy to bring people to be saved. They may be saved as soon as they come into the meeting. It will also be easy for other Christians to come in. When they come into the meeting, they will be impressed. They will realize that something is different. In actuality, what they will sense is the real building up.</p>
<p>The Lord will work this out not only in one locality but also in every place where the seeking ones are. This is a matter not of mere doctrine nor of something outward but of the real building up in life. Nothing can prevail against this. The Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). The true built-up church is the strongest testimony of the Lord. We all must realize the need today. We are under the headship of Christ, but we also must learn to know and to keep the proper order in the Body. This will result in the genuine building up. Then through this the Lord will bring others into the same order, and Christ will head up all things in Himself. This requires that we be built up together.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
THROUGH THE INNER EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:13-14; 2:15; 3:8, 16-19; 4:11-16, 22-24; 5:18-19; 6:18</h1>
<p>In the previous messages we saw that there are three main items in God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church. The first is that the church would have the full sonship. This is a matter of life, not only the life we receive in our new birth but the growth of life, life in maturity and in fullness. This means that God wants to work Himself into us to make us not only His sons but also His heirs to inherit all that He is and all He has. Second, through this life and under the headship of Christ, all things will be headed up by Christ the Head through the church. This aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose involves the building up of the church. First there is life, and then there is building. The building is something in life and under the headship of Christ to bring us all into the proper order. The third item of God&rsquo;s purpose is that in life the church will be built up so that Satan, the enemy of God, will be defeated and put to shame. In life we are built up under the headship of Christ, and through this God has the ground to make His multifarious wisdom known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies so that He can challenge His enemy and put him to shame.</p>
<p>It is God&rsquo;s purpose that through the church He would manifest Himself through His Son, Christ, and put His enemy to shame. God planned, and He created the heavens, the earth, and many creatures for this purpose. Then as the center of God&rsquo;s creation, He created man to be His container, His vessel, that He might put Himself into man to be his life, wisdom, power, light, way, and his everything. Whatever we need is God in Christ Himself, including patience, humility, meekness, and gentleness. By being life and everything to us, God makes us His sons. A son is one who inherits everything from his father, including the father&rsquo;s life, blood, and character. Whatever the father is and whatever the father has is imparted into the son. Therefore, a son must be born, not adopted. To be born of the Father means that whatever the Father is and whatever the Father has is imparted into His sons. When God comes into us to beget us, He imparts Himself into us.</p>
<p>First God created us, and then He begot us. By creating us, He made us to exist, and by begetting us, He imparted Himself into us as our life and everything. For this purpose God created a human spirit within us. We may compare our human spirit to the filament of a light bulb. Without the filament within the bulb, the bulb cannot contain the electricity. The bulb needs the filament within it to be the recipient of the electricity and to express the electricity. Just as the bulb has an outward form, we also have an outward form, which is our body. Then just as within the outward form of the bulb there is the filament to receive, convey, and express the electricity, within our body there is a spirit. We are the vessels, the containers, made by God, so God purposely created a spirit within us to receive Him, contain Him, keep Him, and express Him.</p>
<p>From our spirit God will spread Himself throughout our inward being. The Triune God&mdash;God in Christ as the Spirit&mdash;spreads through us not from without but from within. God first comes into our spirit and fills our spirit. Then constantly from our spirit He spreads outward. By this spreading God permeates and saturates all our inward parts, our whole heart&mdash;our conscience, mind, emotion, and will. When God came into our spirit, we received the birth of life. Now by His spreading from our spirit throughout our whole being we have the growth of life and eventually the maturity, the fullness, of life. Ultimately, even our body will be transfigured; that is, it will be redeemed. This will be our full sonship. In this way we all will be one in being headed up under the headship of Christ. The Head and the Body are a great corporate man (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11). Within this man is the Triune God. Christ is the Head, and by being life to us He saturates, transforms, and transfigures us to bring us into the proper order under His headship. It is through this Body that the Head, Christ, will head up all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISTRACTIONS FROM<br />
THE CENTRAL MARK OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>We need to see the subtlety of the enemy. On the earth today there are three classes of people. First, there are the Jews, God&rsquo;s chosen people. Second, there are the Gentiles, the unbelieving, worldly people. Third, there are the Christians, the members of the church (1 Cor. 10:32). Without exception, all three classes of people have been distracted. For the purpose that humans may exist, God prepared many material, physical things for them, such as food and drink. According to today&rsquo;s situation, however, the unbelievers, the Gentiles, pay all their attention to their eating, drinking, housing, and material life. Regardless of what kind of people they are&mdash;rich, poor, high, low, cultured, or barbarian&mdash;they have been distracted from God&rsquo;s central mark by the material things which God prepared for them to exist in order to fulfill His purpose. Food, drink, and all the material things were intended to be a help, a means, for men to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose, but Satan came in to utilize these things to distract the unbelievers from God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>After God prepared everything for men to exist, He came in to give some of them, the Jews, spiritual knowledge through the Scriptures, the Old Testament. God revealed His law and His will to them with the intention that the Scriptures would help them to know God, God&rsquo;s plan, and God&rsquo;s Christ. Eventually, however, Satan utilized even the Old Testament to distract the Jews from Christ. The four Gospels clearly show how the Jewish scribes, elders, Pharisees, and learned ones were very distracted from Christ by the Scriptures (John 5:39-40). Under Satan&rsquo;s utilization, the Old Testament distracted the Jewish people from Christ to the extent that they even opposed Christ by means of the Scriptures. This is the subtlety of the enemy. Now not only the unbelievers, the Gentiles, have been distracted from God&rsquo;s eternal purpose but even the Jews, who were chosen by God, are distracted from God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>Christians have not merely the material things created by God and the Old Testament revelation of God but also the New Testament. In this New Testament many kinds of gifts are given so that people may know Christ, realize Christ, and be built up together as the Body to express Christ. Yet how subtle the enemy still is! Satan utilizes even the New Testament and all the gifts given by God to distract people from Christ to the gifts and even to the letter of the New Testament apart from Christ. If we consider the entire situation, we will realize that everything prepared by God and given by God for the purpose of fulfilling His economy has been utilized by the subtle enemy to distract people from God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The unbelievers enjoy all the material things, but not for the purpose of God&rsquo;s economy. Similarly, the Jews today have the Old Testament in their synagogues, but not for God&rsquo;s purpose since they are fully distracted from Christ. It is the same in the so-called Christian churches. People there have the Old Testament with the New Testament, and they claim that they have many gifts, but many are still distracted from Christ. This is a pitiful thing. If we have the vision from the heavens to know God&rsquo;s intention, we will weep for the situation. Christians are being distracted even by spiritual gifts to things other than Christ and His Body.</p>
<p>Many fundamental, sound Christians do not have the proper thought concerning God&rsquo;s economy. Fundamental Christianity tells people, &ldquo;God is the true God. He loves you and is merciful and gracious, so He sent His Son to save you. You are sinful and are going to hell, but Christ died for you on the cross. If you believe in Him, your sins will be forgiven and you will be saved. Then you will have peace and joy, and after you die, you will go to dwell with Him in heaven.&rdquo; However, others say, &ldquo;This is not enough. We are not satisfied with only this. We desire the gifts, the manifestations, to prove that God is powerful.&rdquo; All these Christians may never have heard a message on how God intends to work Himself into us through Christ as the Spirit so that Christ as the Head will be expressed through His Body to bring the whole universe under His headship. They have neglected the central mark of God&rsquo;s economy and have not seen the vision of God&rsquo;s economy. Therefore, they too are distracted.</p>
<p>We need the material things. We need food, drink, a home, and transportation. However, we are not for these things. Rather, these things must be for us. If we seek God&rsquo;s kingdom and all His righteousness, God will care for all the things we need (Matt. 6:33). All these things are for us, and we are for God and His purpose. After many years of experience, I can testify that if we care for God&rsquo;s purpose, God will care for our need. He is faithful in this matter. There is no doubt that many times He has tested us, and Satan also has attacked us. Nevertheless, after more than thirty years of living for God&rsquo;s purpose, I am still here. For the sake of His word and His interest, all the necessary material things have passed through my hand. If we care for Him and for His interest, He will care for us. He has given us this promise. Likewise, the Scriptures, knowledge, teachings, gifts, manifestations, operations, functions, and ministries are all for the central mark of God&rsquo;s economy. All these things are for us, but we are not for those things apart from God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MAIN CONTENT OF THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>The book of Ephesians does not talk about the material things, and it does not contain mere knowledge. There are not even many Old Testament quotations in this book. Moreover, it does not mention the miraculous gifts. In this book the gifts are persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (4:11), not the gifts of healing and other miraculous things. The book of Ephesians is a book on the church, the Body of Christ (1:22-23). This book speaks about the unsearchable riches of Christ and how this Christ as the Spirit is in us (3:8, 16-19). This is not an outward Christ but an inward Christ, because He is making His home in us. He is our Head and our life, and our heart&mdash;our mind, emotion, will, and conscience&mdash;is His home. No one can measure His breadth, length, height, and depth, but such a Christ is making home in our heart. Eventually we are filled, not with material things or even with knowledge, gifts, or power, but unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>In chapter 1 there is the sealing of the Holy Spirit (v. 13). The Holy Spirit as a seal in us is inward, not outward. In chapter 2 there is the new man created by Christ and in Christ (v. 15). This also is something apart from material things, mere scriptural knowledge, and gifts. The new man created in Christ and by Christ is fully of Christ, and it is even Christ Himself. In Genesis 3 Eve was a part of Adam and came entirely out of Adam. In the same way, the new man is a part of Christ and was taken from Christ. Then in Ephesians 3 we realize the unsearchable riches of Christ, and Christ makes His home in our hearts (vv. 8, 17). In chapter 4 we grow and arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. We are no more carried away by every wind of teaching, even good teaching, but we grow up into Christ in all things (vv. 13-15). We receive something from Christ as the Head, and we minister it to others. In this way the church is built up (v. 16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR THE CHURCH TO BE BUILT UP IN LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to spend more time to see how the church is built up. Like many young Christians, I was hungry for scriptural knowledge after I was saved. I met a certain group of believers who stressed that in order to be good Christians we must know the Bible. Therefore, I spent much time to know the Bible. Later, about six or seven years after I was saved, there was a &ldquo;spiritual grace&rdquo; movement in north China, which was a branch of the Pentecostal movement. It was very prevailing, and in only a few years it swept over the whole of north China. Thousands of people were saved, and there were many miracles and signs. To a certain degree I was influenced by that movement, so I studied the situation. Eventually I was made clear by the Lord that the Body of Christ could not be built up in that movement. At that time I was not clear about the central content of Ephesians, but through my experiences the Lord showed me that the church can be built up only by our experience of Christ as life, not by knowledge, gifts, or the so-called Pentecostal manifestations. Knowledge and gifts help a little, but the church, the Body of Christ, cannot be built up by these alone. The church must be built up by Christ as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Key to the Building Up of the Church<br />
Being the Inner Experience of Christ as Our Life</h2>
<p>Some may argue for the gifts, saying that they are mentioned in 1 Corinthians. However, out of all the sixty-six books of the Bible, the main book on the church is Ephesians. In this book on the church the gifts are not mentioned. Rather, it speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. This Christ with His unsearchable riches wants to make His home in our hearts. This is what we need. In the Bible there is some ground for knowledge, gifts, miracles, signs, and power. However, these are not the main items needed to build up the Body of Christ. The main item needed for the building up is Christ Himself as life to us. We admit that there is a certain need for knowledge and gifts, but too many Christians do not admit the need for the inner experience of Christ. We admit that sometimes we need medicine, but too many do not acknowledge that we mainly need regular food.</p>
<p>Since we have become Christians, we may have heard very few messages about the inner experience of Christ. In the book of Ephesians, however, the experience of Christ is very prominent. Every chapter deals with this matter. Although some Christians realize that Ephesians is about the church, many still neglect the key to the building up of the church. The key is the inner experience of Christ. Without the inner experience of Christ we can never have the reality of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Central Portion of the Book of Ephesians</h2>
<p>The book of Ephesians is the very heart of the Bible. The heart is the most crucial part. People today fear a heart attack more than anything. We may be able to move, speak, and do many things, but if our heart stops, we are finished. Since Ephesians is the heart of the Scriptures, the enemy, Satan, attacks people&rsquo;s understanding of this book. People today talk about this book, and many realize that this is the most profound book on the church, but they neglect the secret, the key point, of this book. The heart and key of this book is 3:16-19.</p><h2 class="head3">Our Inner Man Needing to Be Strengthened</h2>
<p>Verses 14-15 begin, &ldquo;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named.&rdquo; <em>For this cause</em> refers to God&rsquo;s plan mentioned in the previous chapters and verses, including our predestination unto sonship, the riches of Christ being ministered to us, Christ heading up all things, making the multifarious wisdom of God known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, putting the enemy to shame, and other matters. Verse 16 continues, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; The inner man is our human spirit, regenerated by the Spirit and indwelt by Christ. This spirit needs to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Man is tripartite, having a spirit, soul, and body, but of these three parts the soul is often the strongest. The soul itself is a composition of the mind, emotion, and will, and of these three parts the mind is the strongest. Our biggest problem is that we are too strong in our mind, while our spirit is very weak. We can prove this in the following way. Every kind of person likes to talk. If we say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some time to talk,&rdquo; our mind will be active, strong, and positive. However, when we say, &ldquo;Let us have a time of prayer,&rdquo; everyone is silent. Right away the room may become like a cemetery; everyone will be &ldquo;grieving at the tomb,&rdquo; silent and in order. This is our case because we are too weak in our inner man, our spirit. This is why the writer of Ephesians says that he prayed not in a light way but by bowing his knees, for the cause of the church as God&rsquo;s purpose, that the Father in the universe would grant us to be strengthened into the inner man.</p>
<p>Our spirit needs to be strengthened. There is no need for us to discuss, talk, or argue. The more we talk and argue, the more we exercise our mind. Our mind has been over-exercised and over-developed, but we still try to develop it even more. When a part of our body over-develops, it becomes a cancer that brings death. We need to forget this natural mind which has been taken over by the enemy. It is more profitable to change our discussion into prayer. Let us be humble to forget our thoughts, imagination, understanding, and concepts, and let us bow our knees before the Father and pray to exercise our spirit, not only once but constantly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Our Heart Needing to Be Opened<br />
by the Repenting of Our Mind<br />
and the Exercise of Our Conscience</h2>
<p>In order to exercise our spirit to pray, we need to repent. <em>Repent</em> in Greek means to turn the mind. To repent is to turn our mind to the Lord and have a change of mind. Our mind must be turned from everything other than the Lord back to the Lord. When we turn our mind to the Lord, our conscience shows us how we are wrong with the Lord, so we need to confess. To repent is to turn the mind, and to confess is to exercise the conscience. The mind and the conscience are the two main parts of the heart, and the heart surrounds our spirit. Therefore, the heart is a gateway to our spirit. Through our repenting and confessing, the two main parts of our heart&mdash;our mind and our conscience&mdash;spontaneously are opened. Then when the gateway is opened, the spirit is free, so the Lord is able to strengthen our spirit and spread into our heart.</p>
<p>Verse 17a says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; The heart is a composition of the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. When our mind is set on other things, our conscience is hardened, our emotions are not for Him, and Christ is imprisoned in our spirit. Therefore, we must repent, turn our mind to the Lord, recognize our sinfulness, and confess our failures. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You, and I am for You.&rdquo; In this way our whole heart is exercised and open, so our spirit is wholly free. Then Christ will fill and strengthen our spirit, and spontaneously He will spread from our spirit into our heart to make His home in all the parts of our heart. This means that our whole being will be a dwelling place for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Apprehending the Unlimited Dimensions of Christ by Being Built Up with All the Saints</h2>
<p>Verses 17b-18 continue, &ldquo;That you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are.&rdquo; That we are rooted indicates that we are plants, and our being grounded means that we are a building. Together these two aspects mean that we need to grow and be built up.</p>
<p>We are able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth not by ourselves individually but corporately and jointly. This means that we must be built together. We can never be built up together by doctrinal knowledge. The more knowledge we have, the more fighting and divisions we will have. As Christ makes His home in us, we will forget about mere knowledge, fighting, and divisions. Rather, we will say, &ldquo;O Lord, be merciful to me! I am filled with knowledge and I may have the gifts, but I am short of apprehending You with all the saints.&rdquo; It is when Christ makes His home in our hearts, occupying and taking over every inward part of our being, that we are able to apprehend the unlimited Christ with all the saints. This means that we are able to be built together with all the saints, that we are no more individual but rather corporate. In this way we realize that Christ is immeasurable and without limit. No one can tell what the measure of the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are. These are the dimensions of Christ. Christ is the length, the breadth, the height, the depth. He is immeasurable and unlimited. Together with all the saints we will realize the unsearchable riches of Christ in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">Being Filled unto All the Fullness of God</h2>
<p>Finally, verse 19 says, &ldquo;And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; We are not being filled with material things, scriptural knowledge, or the so-called spiritual gifts but unto all the fullness of God Himself. It is in this way that we are built up together, and it is in this way that we can realize the Body life. Otherwise, we can talk about the Body, but we still will not have its reality. The reality of the Body is this very indwelling Christ experienced by us in an inward way.</p>
<p>We all need a further time to kneel by ourselves in our rooms to pray over these verses until the heavenly vision is revealed into our spirit. This will revolutionize us, and our whole concept will be changed. What we need is not something outward or mere knowledge, gifts, signs, powers, and other such matters. What we absolutely need is the inner experience of the indwelling Christ. Ephesians 3 says that we are strengthened into the inner man, that Christ makes His home in our heart, and that we are filled (not covered or clothed) unto all the fullness of God, that is, the very being, essence, and element of God. The riches of Christ and His immeasurable dimensions include so much that we would need many days to explain even a little of our experience. It is through this inner experience of the indwelling Christ that we apprehend with all the saints the unlimited measure of Christ, and it is by this that we are built up.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Building Up of the Church by All the Saints through the Inner Experience<br />
of the Indwelling Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 1 of chapter 4 begins with, &ldquo;I beseech you therefore.&rdquo; <em>Therefore</em> indicates that what Paul is about to say is based on what was mentioned in chapter 3. Chapter 4 goes on to deal with the building up of the Body. As we have stressed previously, Christ the Head does not build His Body directly. Rather, He builds up the church through the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Even these gifted persons, as the gifts given to the church, do not build the church directly. They perfect the saints as the members of the Body by ministering the unsearchable riches of Christ to them so that they may have the inner experience of the indwelling Christ. Christ makes His home in their hearts to occupy their whole being, and they grow up into Christ in all things. Then they are joined and knit together, and they receive something of the very indwelling Christ whom they have experienced to minister to one another. It is in this way that they are built up as the Body.</p>
<p>The key point concerning the building up of the church is the inner experience of the indwelling Christ. The gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;do not minister gifts to people. Rather, they minister the unsearchable riches of Christ to the saints so that they may be perfected in life and in the experience of Christ in order to grow.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Built Up<br />
Not by Knowledge nor the Gifts but by Life</h2>
<p>If you read Ephesians 3 and 4 again, kneeling before the Lord and praying, the Lord will give you a vision of these things. This is the way for the church to be built up and the way for each of us as members to be built up in the Body. It is not by knowledge or gifts. The more knowledge we have, the more divisions we will have, and the more gifts we have, the more fighting we will have. Rather, it is by the inner life, the inner experience of the indwelling Christ, that we are built up. We must pray, &ldquo;O Father, strengthen us into the inner man, that Your Son, Christ, may make His home in our heart, to take over and possess our whole being, that we may grow in Him and receive something from Him. Then by what we receive of the Head we will be able to minister to all the members of the Body, and we will be joined and knit together for the building up of the Body.&rdquo; It is in this way that we will have the reality of the Body.</p>
<p>This is not my own opinion or interpretation. Ephesians is the book that deals specifically with the church life, and the central portion of Ephesians is chapters 3 and 4. This portion tells us that our inner man must be strengthened, Christ is making His home in our heart, and we are being filled unto all the fullness of God. Then we grow up into Christ in all things and receive something from the Head which we minister to others in order to be built up together. It is in this way that we realize the Body life. This is what we need.</p>
<p>How subtle the enemy is today! He is challenging us on this point. Some say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to these people. They are a poor church. They don&rsquo;t have a nice church building. They only have some poor chairs, not proper pews.&rdquo; Truly, we are poor in material things. Moreover, some say that we are poor in knowledge, and others say we are poor in gifts. However, the church can never go on strongly and be built up properly by miraculous manifestations. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I am an experienced builder, and I have seen the proper way to build up the church. We can never build up a strong church by the gifts. The way to build up the church is by the experience and enjoyment of Christ as life for the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MAIN ITEMS NEEDED<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:14-17a; 4:1-6, 11-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR CHRIST<br />
TO MAKE HIS HOME IN OUR HEART</h2>
<p>In all of his writings, the apostle Paul gave us few examples of his prayers. In the one short book of Ephesians, however, we have two prayers. Before Paul spoke concerning the vision of the church&mdash;what the church is and how God planned to produce the church&mdash;he prayed for us, realizing that we need a spirit of revelation, an inner openness, so that we may see the eternal things (1:15-23). This is the first prayer in this book. Then after unveiling the vision of the church, he realized that this is not merely a matter to be understood, a matter in the mentality. He realized that we need the real experience of what we have seen in the vision. Therefore, he prayed a second time, in the last half of chapter 3. The main point of this prayer is that our inner man must be strengthened so that Christ may make His home not in our spirit but in our heart. There is the real need to stress this. Today even among us there is a big shortage of knowing in our experience how to be strengthened into the inner man by the mighty Spirit of God so that Christ may make His home in our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Need for the Salvation of Our Soul</h2>
<p>We are regenerated in our spirit, and Christ has come into our spirit to dwell there. There is no argument as to whether or not Christ is in our spirit. We need not only to believe but to realize clearly that Christ is dwelling in our spirit. However, this is only the regeneration of our spirit. There are three steps in the application of God&rsquo;s salvation. The first step is regeneration, which is accomplished in our spirit. After this, we still have the problem of the soul. The New Testament clearly reveals that we may be fully regenerated in our spirit yet still be soulish, natural, and darkened in the soul. To be soulish is to be earthly and even to be related to the demons, to be demon-like. Therefore, the New Testament tells us that after being regenerated in our spirit we need the salvation of the soul. Our soul needs to be saved; it needs to be delivered. Hebrews 10:39 speaks of the gaining of the soul, and 1 Peter 1:9 mentions the salvation of our souls. James 1 clearly tells us that we have been brought forth by the word of truth, but we still need the implanted, living word of God, which is able to save our souls (vv. 18, 21). After regeneration in the spirit, therefore, we need transformation in our soul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Need to Repent<br />
by Turning Our Mind and Confessing</h2>
<p>As we have seen, <em>repent</em> in Greek means to turn the mind. The mind is the leading part of the soul. When we exercise our mind to turn to the Lord, our conscience follows, and we confess according to what the conscience perceives. Just as the mind is the leading part of the soul, the conscience is the leading part of the spirit. Therefore, to repent and confess is to exercise our mind and our conscience. When we open our mind and open our conscience, the Lord has an open gateway to fill us.</p>
<p>We have said these things before, but we must repeat them again. They are matters not merely in our human mentality but in the heavenlies. I am concerned that it is easy to receive other teachings, but even if we repeat the above matters many times, we may still forget them. In actuality, it is not simply that we forget. Rather, the enemy snatches these things away. On many occasions when we try to point out these things to people, their thoughts are distracted right at the crucial moment. Then when their attention returns, it is too late, and they receive no impression of them. This is why the New Testament indicates that not only the unbelievers but also the seeking, spiritual believers always need to repent. In the epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord commands most of the seven churches to repent (2:5, 16, 21; 3:3, 19). The first word of preaching in the New Testament is to repent (Matt. 3:2; 4:17). First John 1:9 also tells us to confess our sins, which implies repenting.</p>
<p>To repent is to turn our mind to the Lord, and to confess is to exercise our conscience. To repent and confess are to open our mind and conscience to the Lord. When our mind and conscience are open to the Lord, the gateway is open to Him, and He has the free way to fill us. Then the Lord comes, not from without but from within, to spread Himself in us to saturate all the parts of our soul. Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; The way for our mind to be renewed is by being saturated by the Spirit with Christ. When we open ourselves to the Lord, He comes in to fill us, spreading from our spirit within into all the parts of the soul. Jeremiah 31:33 calls these parts the &ldquo;inward parts.&rdquo; All our inward parts will be saturated by the Spirit with Christ. Then our mind is renewed, and our will and emotion are also renewed. All the parts of our soul will be renewed and saturated with Christ. In other words, all the parts of the soul will be occupied, taken over by Christ. Then Christ will settle down in all the parts of our soul. All the parts of the soul, plus the conscience of the spirit, compose the heart. Therefore, Christ is making His home in our heart (Eph. 3:17).</p><h2 class="head2">Releasing Christ from<br />
the Imprisonment of the Soul</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that we have Christ in our spirit, but there is much doubt as to whether Christ has any place in our soul. There may be no place, no room, and no ground for Christ in our mind, emotion, and will. If this is the case, our spirit is not a residence for Christ but a prison to Him. Christ is imprisoned by our soul. At the time we believed, we exercised our mind to repent. We turned our mind, which means that our mind was open. At the same time we also confessed our sins. Along with our believing there is always our confessing. In this way both our mind and our conscience were opened, so we received the Lord Jesus, and He came into us. After this, however, many believers close their mind and conscience. The Lord Jesus came into them, but they enclose Him within their spirit. To say it in another way, they imprison Him by their conscience, mind, emotion, stubborn will, and self. Christ is in our spirit, but He may be imprisoned. This is the reason why the apostle Paul, after revealing the vision of the Body in the first part of Ephesians, realized that we need our inner man, our spirit, to be strengthened that Christ may make His home in all the parts of the heart&mdash;the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience. This means that Christ will occupy all the inward parts of our human being and settle down in them.</p>
<p>In recent years both here and in the Far East, brothers and sisters have been speaking much about Christ as life and the building up of the church. However, my observation and impression cause me to be sorrowful. Unless the soul is broken and transformed, there is no possibility of having the real church life. This is the reason why even up to the end of his ministry Brother Nee still spoke on the breaking of the outer man for the release of the spirit. The outer man, the soulish man, needs to be broken so that the inner man, the spirit, can be released. People today appreciate Brother Nee&rsquo;s book <em>The Normal Christian Life,</em> but that is only the &ldquo;ABCs.&rdquo; Those were the messages he gave more than twenty-five years ago. In the early years, the first years after I met him, he always stressed those matters. After this, however, he was placed into trials for a long time, and following the second World War his messages almost always stressed the breaking of the outer man.</p>
<p>Before Brother Nee returned to the public ministry after the war, he had a number of times of fellowship with a few brothers. In those long talks he stressed only one thing. Whenever I or someone else raised a question, he always answered in one way&mdash;the outer man must be broken. All the problems come from the fact that the outer man, the soul, is not broken. The soul is too strong. The mind is too natural, the emotion is too worldly, and the will is too human.</p>
<p>A brother may love the Lord, but his mind may never have been renewed; it is still natural. Likewise, his emotion is earthly, and his will is too human and selfish. We can check ourselves by the way we talk. When the brothers and sisters come together to talk, they are very strong, but when we ask them to pray, they are weak. This is because talking is something in the mind, but praying is something in the spirit. If the brothers and sisters are talking and someone says, &ldquo;Let us be silent,&rdquo; they will not stop talking even after being asked several times. The best way to quiet people down is to say, &ldquo;Let us have a time of prayer.&rdquo; Then everyone will be as quiet as a cemetery. This is because to pray requires us to exercise our spirit, and many saints are not prepared to do this. Even if they do pray, they exercise only their mind, and that is what comes out of their mouth. Their prayer does not touch their heart or their spirit.</p>
<p>Many saints simply do not pray at all, not even for several weeks. They come to the church meetings without a life of prayer, yet they are very active in their mind. If we discuss or simply fellowship with one another, eventually we will fight with one another. You have your opinion, I have my idea, and everyone has something to say. We are very strong in the mind. However, when we ask people to pray, the weakness in their spirit is immediately exposed. This is why we are stressing this matter once again.</p>
<p>Similarly, this is why Paul, when he comes to the matter of experience in Ephesians, prays, &ldquo;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts&rdquo; (vv. 14, 16-17a). Christ is indwelling our spirit, but He may not be occupying all the inward parts of our soul. This is a very vital matter.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; There is no doubt that Christ is in us, but our soul is too strong, natural, earthly, and human. Therefore, eventually, whether intentionally or unintentionally, we imprison Christ by our soul. It is the same with all of us. We all have Christ, but our Christ has been imprisoned within us. The church life is Christ realized, expressed, and experienced by all the saints in a corporate way. This Christ comes out of all the persons and mingles us together. However, if Christ is imprisoned by the soulish life in you, and He is imprisoned by the soulish life in me, how can we have the church life? Christ is within us, but He cannot be expressed, and He cannot be realized by us because of our soul. One person&rsquo;s soul is strong, and another person&rsquo;s soul is even stronger. One person exercises his mind, and another exercises his mind even more. Yes, we are brothers, and we are the members of the Body, but all these members are covered and concealed with a layer of soulish &ldquo;wax.&rdquo; This soulish &ldquo;wax&rdquo; is very strong. We are too strong in our mind, in our emotion, and in our will. This is why we need to be strengthened into our inner man. Then Christ will fill us and spread from within to take over our heart. Then the soul will be subdued and broken, and all the parts of the soul will be renewed. Then Christ will be expressed, and it is by this Christ that we are one.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Joined by the Divine Nature<br />
through the Strengthening of Our Spirit<br />
and the Subduing of Our Soul</h2>
<p>The greater part of the tabernacle was the forty-eight standing boards, which were overlaid with gold. On the overlaying gold were golden rings, and within the golden rings were golden bars (Exo. 26:18-29). It is by this overlaying gold that all the boards were joined together as one. If we could have taken away the gold and left only the forty-eight boards, they would immediately have fallen apart. This signifies that in ourselves there is no oneness. The oneness is in the overlaying gold, which signifies divinity, the divine nature. It is in this divinity, in the Triune God as the overlaying divine gold, that we are covered and joined together. This type gives us a clear picture. It is not possible for us to be one with each other in ourselves. We are only the wooden boards. In ourselves there is no joining element. The uniting element is the gold, the divine nature. Therefore, we need to be overlaid by, with, and in the Triune God. In the Triune God there is the joining power. The golden ring and bar also signify the joining power in the divine nature. When Christ possesses us and makes home in all the parts of our being, He becomes our oneness. Only Christ is the oneness, and we all are one in Him. John 17:21 says, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&rdquo; We are one &ldquo;in Us,&rdquo; that is, in the Triune God.</p>
<p>The secret of the oneness is first with our spirit, our inner man, and then with our soul. Our inner man must be strengthened, and our soul must be subdued, renewed, taken over, occupied, and possessed by the indwelling Christ. Then Christ will be freed, and we will be under Him and in Him. It is through this indwelling and released Christ that we are one. In this way we can have the church life.</p>
<p>We all need to bring these things to the Lord and spend some time with Him to pray for this matter. I believe that one day the Lord will open our eyes to see this clearly. These things are spiritual facts, but not many people have realized them. The unbelievers cannot realize them, and not many believers realize them either, or else there would have been no need for the apostle to pray in Ephesians 3. He prayed for us to this end, and we also need to pray for this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>After his prayer in Ephesians 3, Paul proceeds to chapter 4. The first part of this chapter reveals the proper way to practice the church life. Today we hear many voices speaking in different ways about the church, but many people have forgotten Ephesians 4. In the short passage from verse 1 to verse 16, the apostle under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit wrote something very profound. All the aspects of the church life are here. Many who talk about the church life today have neglected and forgotten this portion of the Word. In order to practice the church life, we must realize all the main aspects, the main points, concerning the church in Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>Paul begins by saying, &ldquo;I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord&rdquo; (v. 1a). Paul realized that he was a prisoner not merely in a prison but in Christ. He was imprisoned in Christ. In order to have the church life, we need to be a prisoner in Christ with no freedom of the self. We must lose our liberty to be imprisoned by Christ. The church is a &ldquo;prison&rdquo; to us. We need to be imprisoned in the Lord in the church.</p>
<p>Paul continues, &ldquo;To walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace&rdquo; (vv. 1b-3). Whenever we talk about the practice of the church life, we must remember that the first thing needed is to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This requires that we forget about everything else. The third stanza of the traditional hymn &ldquo;Onward Christian Soldiers&rdquo; says, &ldquo;One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.&rdquo; This is not an accurate concept. Christians can never be one in doctrine. If someone has a certain understanding about a particular portion of the Bible, he may hold to that portion without caring for the oneness. Many Christians insist on baptism by sprinkling, some insist on a single immersion, and some insist on three immersions. Some immerse in warm water, others immerse in cold water, and still others baptize in other ways. In this one matter alone there are many opinions. In order to realize the church life we need to forget about doctrine. If we pay attention to doctrine, we may become a &ldquo;three-immersions&rdquo; church. Praise the Lord, the Spirit is in you and in me, so we all are one in the Spirit. Therefore, it is better to sing the above line as, &ldquo;One in faith and Spirit, / One eternally&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #871).</p>
<p>I am concerned that we may hold on to something that is not an element of the saving faith or of the oneness of the Spirit. Some believers have their favorite item, a matter that they love. In a sense, they are addicted to that thing. Some, for example, are &ldquo;addicted&rdquo; to speaking in tongues. If they hear someone speaking in tongues, they do not consider whether it is genuine or false. In the same principle, we too may have something to which we are addicted. Whatever someone is addicted to is a dividing element. It may seem that he is one with others, but there is still something within him that divides and keeps him from others. He may come to the meetings, but inwardly he is not one. Something within him is secretly and subtly dividing.</p>
<p>The Lord can testify that by His mercy I always try my best to forget about everything else in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit. When certain dear ones brought tambourines to play in the meetings, I was not bothered. Although I do not prefer this, I did not insist on not having them. I told the brothers, &ldquo;As long as they worship God, it is all right with me. Let them play the tambourine.&rdquo; However, those dear ones eventually insisted on their practice in a divisive way, and they frightened others away. We should not have anything within us as a dividing element. The practice of the oneness exposes where we are. The problems we have faced in Los Angeles for the past two and a half years are due to some dear ones insisting on something other than the oneness of the Spirit. We need to care for keeping the oneness of the Spirit and not for anything else. If someone says that the Lord Jesus is not the Son of God, we should sacrifice our life to fight for the truth, but if someone wants to play the tambourine in the meeting, we should simply say, &ldquo;Brother, if you feel free to do that, then do it, but please also take care of others.&rdquo; Whether or not to play the tambourine means nothing. We must forget about everything else and keep only one thing&mdash;the oneness of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Verses 4 through 6 go on to name all the elements of the oneness&mdash;one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one Father&mdash;that is, the Triune God in us to make us one Body. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us (John 14:11; 1 Cor. 15:45; Rom. 8:9, 11). Now we are one Body, which is the real mingling of the Triune God with man. In all the above matters we are one. There is no argument about these items; they are what we need to hold. To keep the oneness of the Spirit is the first aspect for the practice of the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE GIFTED PERSONS<br />
BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Following this, Paul goes on to speak in Ephesians 4 about the functions of the gifted persons. On the one hand, we all are one in the Spirit, in the Triune God, in the saving faith, and in all the matters in verses 4 through 6. On the other hand, though, the ministries of the gifted persons seem to be different. There are the apostles&rsquo; ministry, the prophets&rsquo; ministry, the evangelists&rsquo; ministry, and the ministry of the shepherds and teachers. There are at least these four categories of ministries. Nevertheless, the purpose of all the ministries is still one. All the different ministries are for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Consider the situation today. Do the evangelists care for the Body? Many evangelists forget about the Body and neglect the Body; they are only for evangelism. This is why there are divisions today. A prevailing evangelist with his prevailing preaching may spontaneously form a division. Likewise, a great teacher may live and work only for his teaching and not for the Body, and eventually a division may come out of his teaching. Instead of being for the building of the Body, these ministries often create divisions.</p>
<p>We should apply all these things to ourselves. If many of us go out to work for the Lord, some may be more evangelical, but others will care more for teaching. It may be that the evangelists will form something for their evangelism, and the teachers will form something for their teaching, both neglecting the building of the Body. We need to see the vision that all the different ministries are for one purpose. If someone preaches the gospel, he should not keep the result, the fruit, of his preaching in his own hand. He must keep his own hand away from the result of his preaching and let the fruits of his preaching be for the building up of the church. Likewise, regardless of how much we help people by our teaching, we should not keep the result of our teaching in our hand. We must let the fruits of our teaching be for the local church. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>It is a shame to say that even among us there is a secret trend of certain gifted persons keeping the result of their work in their hand. This is not for the building up; rather, it is a tearing down. In order to practice the church life, we must be clear about this. In the same way, all the saints should not be for any one ministry. They must be for the church. Someone may say, &ldquo;I have received much help from this teacher. I am for him.&rdquo; However, if you are for this teacher, he should not receive you in that way. Some in Corinth said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; but Paul answered by saying that he was for them (1 Cor. 3:4, 21-22). We should not be for any one person or his ministry. Rather, we are for the church where we live. We should forget about any minister who does something for his own ministry.</p>
<p>However, we should not blame the gifted persons. We need to blame ourselves, the congregation. It is too easy for people to be the followers of an idol. To say, &ldquo;I am of Paul; I appreciate him&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Peter&rdquo; is fleshly (1 Cor. 1:12; 3:4). We must not say that we are for someone. We should say, &ldquo;I am for the church in my locality.&rdquo; If the saints are clear about this, no one will be able to create a division. If anyone tries to create a division, he will be by himself. No one will follow him. Rather, we will all go along with the local church. We may be kind to that brother and say, &ldquo;Brother, we do appreciate your ministry. Praise the Lord! However, we are not for your ministry. We are for the local church. Moreover, we believe that you also know that your ministry is for the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When people said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; Paul was not happy. However, today people like to hear this kind of statement. If someone would tell us, &ldquo;I am for your ministry,&rdquo; we may be very happy, but if they would say, &ldquo;I am not for your ministry; I am for the local church,&rdquo; we may be disappointed. To be this way is shameful. Nevertheless, we must blame ourselves because it is too easy for us to follow a ministry. We all have to share the responsibility of the wrongdoing. To receive a ministry is right, but we are not for the ministry, and we do not follow that ministry. We are for the local church. From now on, wherever we are, we must be only for the local church. Then no gifted person will be able to create a division among us.</p>
<p>The reason there is nearly no real practice of the church life today is simply that people are not clear about these points. On the one hand, some always keep something other than the oneness of the Spirit. On the other hand, others too easily follow certain ministries. As a result, there is no church life. These two items alone are sufficient to annul and destroy the church life. First, we should not have anything within us that divides. We must keep only one thing, the oneness of the Spirit. Second, we appreciate all the helpful ministries, but we must not be for any one of these ministries. We must be for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING BUILT UP<br />
NOT DIRECTLY BY THE GIFTED ONES<br />
BUT BY ALL THE PERFECTED MEMBERS</h2>
<p>The gifted persons do not build up the church directly. On the one hand, the Lord told us in Matthew 16:18, &ldquo;I will build My church,&rdquo; but on the other hand, even Christ the Head does not build His church directly. The Head builds the church through the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Likewise, the gifted persons also should not and do not build up the church directly. Ephesians 4:11 mentions the different gifted persons. Then verse 12 tells us that all these gifted persons are not for the building up of the church directly but are for the perfecting of the saints. If you are a gifted person, you should not build up the church directly. Your responsibility is to perfect all the local brothers, who build up the church directly. What you need to do is perfect others, train them, qualify them, enrich them, empower them, and teach them. Then let them do the work of building. Your duty is not to build up the church directly. Your duty is to perfect the saints. Let the perfected saints do the building work directly.</p>
<p>This is a very important matter. Many times I do not do much in the meetings because I do not want to give the impression that the meetings are my business. They are not my business. When I come to the meetings, I come as a guest. The saints are the host, so they need to serve, and I simply enjoy. I must say this because of our background in Christianity. In the Catholic Church there are priests, in the denominations there are ministers or pastors, and among the Brethren there are responsible brothers. We may compare these different persons to styles of clothes. I may put on Western clothes today, Japanese clothes another day, and traditional Chinese clothes the next, but I am still the same person. Likewise, whether we call certain ones pastors, ministers, or responsible brothers, they are the same kind of clergy. We should not have any clergy or laity among us.</p>
<p>For the past two years we also have had leading brothers. All the leading ones in the meeting must be careful about the way they act, not giving people the impression that they are taking the lead. Here again there are two responsible parties. On one side, the leading ones may carelessly act in a way that gives people the impression that they are taking the lead. On the other side, many of the dear brothers and sisters are weak and not right in their spirit, and they also have a wrong concept, coming to the meetings in a passive way, not in an active way. However, now we need to be clear. In order to practice the church life, the gifted persons should not build up the church directly. What they must do is perfect the saints and let them build up the church directly. This is the third aspect for the practice of the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">ARRIVING AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>Verse 13 is a very important and practical verse. It says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; This verse speaks of arriving at three things. First, there is the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. This oneness is related to the oneness of the Spirit. We may illustrate these two kinds of oneness in this way. Three brothers may be saved all in the same night. After they are saved, they all have the same Spirit, so they have the oneness of the Spirit. At that time they are innocent and do not know much. They are newly saved, they have the Holy Spirit within them, and they love one another. After a short while, however, the first brother meets a pastor from a Southern Baptist denomination who is very devoted to the Lord and renders him much help. The brother appreciates him very much, and after a few months the brother is indoctrinated by him.</p>
<p>Similarly, the second brother receives much help from a Presbyterian at his place of work, and soon he too is indoctrinated with the Presbyterian teaching. At the same time the third brother receives help from someone in the Methodist denomination. After a few months these brothers meet again, and they begin to fight. The first brother fights for the Southern Baptist way, the second for the Presbyterian way, and the third for the Methodist way. The more these brothers learned, the more they were divided. Moreover, one brother changes and begins to meet with the Brethren. Then when he learns their ways and practices, he picks up even more divisive elements. This is a pitiful situation. All three brothers thought that they were growing. However, they were growing only in their mind, not in the Lord. They were growing in doctrinal knowledge and not in the spirit. This situation will persist until some proper gifted persons perfect these three brothers and help them to grow. Perhaps after half a year by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy they will have more growth. Then the more they receive the proper help and grow, the more they will be able to drop the things they picked up after they were saved. Then all three brothers will arrive at the oneness of the faith. In actuality, this means that they have come back to the oneness they once had.</p>
<p>Verse 13 also speaks of arriving at a full-grown man. To arrive in this way is a matter not of knowledge or gifts but of growth. We should not consider if a person is right according to teachings, gifts, or other matters. Rather, we should check to see if he is growing. The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in this verse is also related to growth. The gifted persons need to perfect the saints in the above three matters. They must help the saints to grow that they may arrive at the oneness of the faith. Many saints have picked up many things due to receiving the wrong help. Now the gifted ones must render them the proper help that they may drop all these wrong things, grow, and arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at maturity in the life of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING OUR DOCTRINES TO CARE ONLY<br />
FOR CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; Faith is different from the teaching, or doctrine, mentioned in this verse. As long as we believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God who was incarnated as a man, died on the cross for our sins, and resurrected, we are saved, regardless of whether or not we believe in a particular doctrine. This proves that the teaching spoken of in verse 14 is not a part of the faith. Rather, it is a wind to blow us away from Christ and from the Body. Today many different winds of doctrines are blowing people away from the church life. We need to keep the faith, but we must drop the doctrines. When I say this, some may say, &ldquo;This man teaches heresy. The Bible tells us to learn doctrine, but this man says we should forget about doctrine.&rdquo; Nevertheless, if we will leave the doctrines, the winds of teaching, we will be blessed by God.</p>
<p>We need to drop the mere doctrines and love the Lord, contact Him, testify for Him, and live in the spirit with Him. We need to fight the battle, not against people but for the recovery of the Body life. We must testify to the principalities and powers in the heavenlies that we are here for nothing but Christ and His Body. If we are not, then we will not be able to face the situation when we go out. The winds of teaching are seducing and subtle. When I read certain teachings, I sense the seducing spirit. They seem very convincing. If we have not laid a basic foundation, I am afraid that we will not be able to withstand them. We too will be blown away.</p>
<p>I thank the Lord for His sovereignty. I was born in Christianity, and I learned all the things of Christianity. I also learned under the Brethren, so I know what they teach. However, I realized by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that this is not the right way. This is not the way of life, and it is not the right way to practice the church life. From now on, may we know nothing but Christ as our life, and may we come together in Him and with Him to practice the church life, walking, acting, working, serving in the spirit, and being limited by the Body. This is all we need to do. In the fear of God and in the love of the Lord we would not touch anything sinful. Moreover, we would forget about the mere doctrines, interpretations, and similar matters. We read the Word not for the understanding of doctrines but to partake of the life in Christ through the spirit. Day by day we read the Bible to feed on the Lord, not to learn the mere doctrines.</p>
<p>Verse 14 speaks of the wind of teaching, not the wind of heresies. It seems that teachings and doctrines are good. Nevertheless, from now on all the brothers who feel burdened to minister among us must minister in a way to feed people with life, not to teach people to know certain expositions and interpretations. The sisters likewise should learn not to speak in a doctrinal way. Whenever someone is speaking mere doctrines, we should pray, look to the Lord, and tell him, &ldquo;Let us come back to Christ. Let us come back to contact Him, follow Him, and feed on Him. Forget about the mere mental understanding of the letters.&rdquo; The letter, the doctrine, kills, but the Spirit gives life (2 Cor. 3:6). We all need to exercise in this way.</p>
<p>If you go to the Far East and contact the brothers, especially in Taipei, you will have the sense that they do not pay much attention to mere doctrines. They simply pay their attention to love the Lord, live Him, and serve Him. We must build up this kind of atmosphere among us. To not pay attention to doctrines does not mean that we are careless with the proper teaching. We are not careless with the proper teaching, but we do not pay our attention to mere teaching. Of course, we do not go along with anything that is sinful or that damages the Lord&rsquo;s Body. However, we pay our full attention mainly to the living Lord, to the Spirit, and to His church.</p>
<p>The winds of teaching include many matters. If we argue about teaching, we will miss the mark. Instead of arguing, we need to always keep to the mark of Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. We must love Him, contact Him, walk with Him and in Him, and be willing to be joined with others. Then we will have the church life and minister Christ to others. This is all we need, and this is what the apostle teaches in Ephesians 4.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING TO CHRIST AS THE REALITY<br />
TO GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Verse 15 continues, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; We not only speak the truth, but we hold to the truth. Truth here does not refer to mere teachings. To hold to truth means to hold to the reality. We must not argue about teaching or forms. Rather, we need to hold the reality, which is Christ. We should not argue with people about baptism by sprinkling or immersion, for example. Instead, we simply need to hold the reality of baptism. The reality of baptism is our identification with Christ. We have been crucified, buried, and resurrected with Him. This identification with Christ is the very reality of baptism. Similarly, the sisters should not argue with people about the outward head covering. Rather, they should keep the reality of head covering, which is the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 15 says that if we hold the reality, we will grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ. When we hold the reality, we grow into Christ. This proves that the truth we hold, the reality, is Christ. We keep Christ as the reality in all things. That we need to grow up into Christ in all things indicates that in some things we have not yet grown up into Him. To grow up into Christ in all things is to be taken over by Him. In every aspect of all things we need to be possessed by Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT UP IN THIS AGE<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RETURN</h2>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; With every member, that is, every part, there is an operation in a measure. Each one has a part, and each one&rsquo;s function in its measure must be applied to the church life. The growth in this verse is for the building up of the Body in love. This means that the Body builds itself up not directly by the gifted persons but by all the different parts, the different members. The gifted persons take the responsibility to educate, train, qualify, empower, enrich, and perfect the members, and the members themselves build up the local church directly by their function.</p>
<p>This verse says that the Body is joined together and knit together. Even today some say that the church will be built up only in the heavens, that this cannot be accomplished on the earth in this age. If this were the case, there would be no need for us to come together. According to verses 1 through 16, the building is something that is accomplished today on this earth. Unless this goal is realized on the earth, the Lord Jesus will not be able to come back. There is the real need of the building up. Wait and see&mdash;if not the whole Body, at least a small number, a remnant, a part of the Body, will be recovered for the building up. This recovery will be a preparation for Christ&rsquo;s return. In order to practice the church life, we must not neglect any of the matters we have fellowshipped in this message. We need to keep all these points. Then we will know the way to practice the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MAIN ITEMS NEEDED<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-16; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:9</h1>
<p>The proper practice of the church life is revealed in almost a full way in Ephesians 4. However, this chapter has been mostly neglected by Christianity in the past. We must be clear about the main points in this chapter, and we must put all of them into practice. If we are not clear about these points or if we do not practice them, we are still not in the proper practice of the church life.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the last half of chapter 3 is Paul&rsquo;s prayer. Paul makes such a prayer because, having presented a full revelation and vision of the Body, he is about to speak concerning the practice of the church. To have only the vision of the church is to have something &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; We need the vision brought down to the earth and put into practice. When people today speak about the church in Ephesians, they are mostly limited to the first part, talking about the church in the way of vision. However, there are not many books and messages that deal with chapter 4. Even when people talk about oneness, it is still in the way of vision, not in the way of practice. We must realize that while the first section of this book is the section of vision, the second section is a matter of practice. That is why the writer, before he begins the section of practice, realizes the need of prayer. He bows his knees before the Father that we may be strengthened into the inner man and that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that is, that Christ may occupy our whole being (3:14-17a). After this prayer he goes on to speak concerning the practice of the church life.</p>
<p>We need to be clear about the main points in Ephesians 4:1-16, and we must put them into practice. Otherwise, we are not in the practical church life. What we are dealing with in these messages is not merely a lesson or teaching. Rather, we are being trained and prepared for the future. Some may not have the proper discernment about the church. In the Far East, in Europe, and in the United States I have observed that not many Christians, even the seeking ones, are truly clear about the church life. It is difficult for people to understand what a division, sect, or denomination is. We ourselves may be clear about these things now, but when some go to start the church life in other places, they may lose their direction. Perhaps after being in a new locality for two years, they will create a division, a small denomination. Although they will do this only unconsciously, it will still cause damage.</p>
<p>In 1:17 Paul prays that we may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Revelation always comes from wisdom. We first have wisdom and then revelation. This is why we need training. This training affords the wisdom, and then the revelation can come. Sometimes people question why I repeat myself many times in my messages. However, even if I repeat something ten times, some people are still not impressed. If the audience would be properly impressed, there would be no need to repeat. It is the ministering Spirit, not my mentality, that knows the situation. The ministering Spirit is very sensitive, and we cannot cheat Him. When we come to a meeting with the ministering Spirit, we immediately realize what the actual situation is. There is no need for people to say that they do not understand. The ministering Spirit already knows that they do not understand, and the ministering Spirit also realizes when there is opposition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Seven Items of Oneness in Ephesians 4</h2>
<p>The first main point in chapter 4 is the oneness. This oneness is related to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:9, 15-16). The seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo; in Ephesians 4:3-6 include four persons&mdash;one Father, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body. These four persons become one. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body (John 14:11; 1 Cor. 15:45; 1 Cor. 12:13; Rom. 8:9, 11). The Father, Son, and Spirit are the Triune God, who is three in one. Now this Trinity is in the Body, which is related to the flesh. Therefore, this is God manifested in the flesh. The Father in the Son, the Son as the Spirit, and the Spirit in the Body, which is composed of all the regenerated and transformed persons, is a universal unit, a universal person. This is the mystery of the faith and the mystery of godliness. The mystery of the faith is the very mystery of godliness, which is the Triune God manifested in the corporate Body. This is the real oneness. Nothing else constitutes the genuine oneness.</p>
<p>The other three factors of oneness in Ephesians 4 are one hope, one faith, and one baptism. The way the universal unit of the Triune God and the Body is formed is by faith and baptism. Faith is for being identified and joined with the Triune God, and baptism is to separate us from the old creation. By faith we are joined to the new creation, and by baptism we are separated from the old. Baptism is a burial (Rom. 6:3-4). The best way to have a thorough clearance is to be buried. To be buried means that we are finished with the old things. Faith brings us into an identification with the Triune God, and baptism separates us from the old relationships in the old creation. Now we are in the Body, and we are the Body. We need only one thing more&mdash;to be transfigured in our physical body. We have this hope ahead of us. We are the Body, and we hope for nothing but the Lord&rsquo;s coming, in which our physical body will be transfigured into a glorious body (Phil. 3:21). The foregoing are the seven ones in Ephesians 4. All Christians agree with these seven ones. Thus, they become our oneness. We should not bring in anything else. We need only to keep these seven ones.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Liberated from Our Opinions<br />
and Not Imposing Our Practice on Others</h2>
<p>To say these things is easy, but it is not easy to put them into practice. This word is very simple, but the matter itself is very complicated. We may illustrate this with the cup in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. Concerning the cup, there are two problems. The first is how many cups there should be. Should we have one big cup or many small cups? The second problem is the content. Should it be juice or wine? In the United States there are many people who are addicted to alcohol. In their physical body there has been a chemical change that requires them never to contact actual wine. Therefore, some prefer to use grape juice in the Lord&rsquo;s table. However, others may say that according to history the ancient Jews used grapes to make wine, not juice; thus, it is not possible that the Lord Jesus used juice on that night. Suppose a brother comes to us to speak about this matter. What attitude must we take? The best way is to check with the seven ones. The problem of how to serve the cup is not included in the seven ones. Therefore, we can be liberal in this matter. If a matter is not among the seven ones, it is right to be general.</p>
<p>We need to learn to be liberated from our opinion. We all have our own opinion in spiritual things. If our opinion is to have one cup, it will be hard to go along with those who want many cups. This may cause us to dig in the Scriptures until we find Luke 22:17, which says, &ldquo;Take this and divide it among yourselves.&rdquo; Then we may say, &ldquo;See? This means that we should start with one big cup and then divide it into many cups.&rdquo; Someone may raise another argument, pointing out that since medical science is so advanced, we all know that we spread germs when we drink from one cup. The one who is in favor of many cups will have many things to say, and the one whose opinion is in favor of one cup will have more arguments to give. We should realize that underneath the arguments is our favorite practice. We must be liberated from our favorite practice. If we are in favor of one cup, we need to be liberated. It is better to learn the lesson to go along with the brother who is in favor of many cups. At the same time, he should also learn to go along with those who favor one cup. Eventually, we will all go along with the Lord. Then we will be liberated. Do not insist on one cup or on many cups. Again, to say this is easy, but to practice it is not easy. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>There are many items that are subject to argument. Many people argue about the Trinity. Some say that we should not teach that the Son is both the Father and the Spirit. If we do not say this, however, what should we do with Isaiah 9:6, which tells us that a Son is given, but His name is called Eternal Father. Moreover, what should we do with 1 Corinthians 15:45, which says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; You must give me the liberty to say that, according to these verses, the Son is the Father and the Spirit. However, I also must not demand that others speak in the way I do. Others should not demand me to speak one way, and I should not insist that they speak another way.</p>
<p>It is the same with the gift of speaking in tongues. If a brother speaks in tongues, we should not oppose him. Before the Lord, I must admit that I do not like to speak in tongues. I had this experience in the past, but now I do not want it any more. Nevertheless, if someone speaks in tongues, I will not oppose him, and if I do not speak in tongues, he should not oppose me. It is too much for anyone to impose speaking in tongues on those who do not practice it. If you like to eat English muffins, then eat them. I prefer another kind of bread. If you eat your muffin, and I eat my bread, neither of us should oppose the other. None of these matters are included in the seven ones. Speaking in tongues is not among the seven ones, and particular truths concerning the Trinity are also not clearly stated in the seven ones. We all need to learn this lesson.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Liberal Attitude toward Others<br />
for the Sake of the Oneness</h2>
<p>Our attitude must be liberal, and we should not be divided. Nevertheless, to practice the oneness is not very easy. When some came among us with the practice of speaking in tongues, I begged them not to insist on or impose this practice. I said, &ldquo;If you want to speak in tongues, then do it, and if others do not want to speak in tongues, let them not do it. If you impose this on others, you will cause a division.&rdquo; At that time only about twenty percent of the saints agreed with speaking in tongues. I told those certain ones that to insist on their practice would frighten away the eighty percent. Then only those who agree with speaking in tongues would be left. What then would be the need to come together to practice the church life? They might as well have stayed where they had been before. Eventually, some stopped meeting with us because we would not impose speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>Many brothers can testify that I was not bothered by their practice. We could go along even with their playing of the tambourine. However, they should have taken care of others&rsquo; feeling. This is not any person&rsquo;s meeting. It is a meeting of the church, and the church includes all the believers. We need to bear the responsibility in this matter. We should not be persons who insist on a practice. We need to be liberated from all these things. Unless something is actually sinful, we can go along with it, because all these items are not touched by the seven ones.</p>
<p>Do not think that this is a small matter. We need to know the proper teaching concerning many different matters. However, knowing the teaching is one thing, but our attitude is another. According to Romans 14, the apostle Paul was very clear about the keeping of days and the eating of foods. However, his attitude was very liberal. He did not tell people what was right and what was wrong. As far as teaching was concerned he was very clear, but as far as attitude was concerned he was liberal. We know that baptism by immersion is proper, for example, but if someone insists on baptizing by sprinkling, we will not fight with him. If he feels the peace to do it, he can do it. We are liberal in this matter because the method of baptism is not included in the seven ones. In order to keep the oneness we need to drop certain things. If we do not drop them, we will cause divisions. We may be one with those who do not agree with immersion. However, they may not be at peace, always thinking of how to convince us to go along with sprinkling. We should not be this way. We have no intention to convince others to go along with us, so they likewise should not try to convince us.</p>
<p>We must be very liberal, while always keeping the oneness and holding the mystery of the faith. We must be willing to sacrifice our lives to keep the faith, but as for other matters we need to be liberated. If we do this, we will have the oneness. Otherwise, we may say that we have oneness, but our real oneness will be in doubt. On the one hand, we strictly hold the mystery of the faith that God is the Triune God who was incarnated as a man to mingle Himself with us through His redemption. Even to the sacrifice of our lives we must hold to this. As to other things, however, we must be liberal. All the divisions, denominations, and sects come from holding to things other than the seven ones.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GIFTED PERSONS BEING<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The second main point in Ephesians 4 is concerning the gifts, that is, the gifted persons. The purpose of all the gifted persons ultimately is the building up of the Body. This thought can be found even in the Old Testament. Ephesians 4:8 is a quotation of Psalm 68:18, which says, &ldquo;You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; / You have received gifts among men, / Even the rebellious ones also, / That Jehovah God may dwell among them.&rdquo; Darby&rsquo;s New Translation reads, &ldquo;Thou hast received gifts in Man,&rdquo; that is, as man, in connection with mankind. When Christ ascended to the heavens, He was still a man, and in man and as man He represented man. As the representative of man, He received gifts from God, even the rebellious ones, so that Jehovah God may dwell among men. Even in the Old Testament there is the thought that the gifts which Christ received from the Father and gave to the church are for the purpose of building up a dwelling place for God. Christ in His human nature as a man, representing man, received gifts of men, and He gave them to His church that God might have a dwelling place.</p>
<p>All the gifts are for the building up of the dwelling place of God. The reason that many sects, divisions, and denominations have come into existence is that the gifted persons were not clear about this purpose. If we observe the situation and read the history of the church, we will find that most of the time, where there was a gifted person, a division was created. I do not like to criticize D. L. Moody, for example, because he did not carry out his work for a denomination. Today, though, we can still see a so-called Moody church. Many gifted persons were not clear that their gifts, or they themselves as the gifts, were not for their own work but for the building up of the church. Consider the situation today. Almost every gifted person has a certain kind of work. Their ministry is for that work, and that work becomes the center of their ministry. This is wrong. The center of the ministry must be the local churches.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, the apostles did not carry out any work for their own ministry. Whatever they did was for the building up of the local churches. Some gifted ones may argue and say, &ldquo;We too are building up the church, not the local churches but the universal church.&rdquo; This is too much &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; If we do not have the local church, how can we have the universal church? Is the universal church not on the earth? We cannot practically see the universal church. To build up the church is to build up the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Thyatira, or the church in some other locality (Rev. 1:11). We do not find in the New Testament that the apostles built up only the universal church. What they did was to build up the local churches. If we pay our attention to work for the local churches, not our own ministry, then all divisions will disappear. This is not a small matter. Are you working for the local churches, or are you working for your ministry?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GIFTED PERSONS PERFECTING<br />
AND RAISING UP THE OTHER MEMBERS</h2>
<p>The third point in Ephesians 4 is that the gifted members do not build up the church directly. Rather, they perfect the saints for the building up of the church. We may think that we know how to work, but we may not know how to perfect the saints. It seems that we know how to preach the gospel, and it may be easy to teach the Bible, but as evangelists and teachers we may not know how to perfect others. I have seen a gifted person working in one place for thirty years, but not one person was perfected by him. For thirty years not one young co-worker or elder was produced. The one brother simply served as a &ldquo;pastor,&rdquo; not knowing how to perfect others.</p>
<p>The gifted ones need to raise up some elders and perfect them. A brother may be good &ldquo;raw material&rdquo; for being an elder, but a certain kind of work must be carried out on this raw material to perfect him to become an elder. In order to work as gifted persons, we must learn how to perfect others. If a gifted person notices that a certain brother is good material to be a deacon, he needs to perfect him, just as a carpenter works on his material to perfect it to become an item of furniture. However, not many gifted persons work in this way today. This is why a group may meet together for fifteen years under a single worker, without producing even one useful person. This is wrong. Consider the history of the apostle Paul. The more he worked, the more young ones were produced as his co-workers and the more local elders and deacons were established, trained, and perfected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting Matters into the Hands of the Saints</h2>
<p>A brother may be sent by the Lord to work in a certain place. After two or three years, however, there may be only a group of people meeting around him. He may say that he has brought people to meet around the Lord Jesus, but in fact they are meeting around him. It may also be that not one elder, deacon, or deaconess has been produced. Eventually, this will cause a division, because the more that brother works there, the more the work is not for the perfecting of the saints and the building up of the Body but for his own work. In that case, that meeting will not be a proper church. It will be merely that brother&rsquo;s work. This may seem clear now, but after a brother works for two years, this may no longer be clear to him. There may always be the excuse, the pretense, that he cannot trust the saints. Because they do not know how to carry out things, he may feel that he has to do them. He will not be able to put matters into their hands, because he will fear that they will damage them. Therefore, he will keep everything in his hand, thinking that only he is the right person. In one sense, he may do this with a good motive, but he is wrong nevertheless.</p>
<p>We need to let the brothers do something. If they do it wrongly, they will learn the lessons. If someone has a small child, he should not say to him, &ldquo;You do not know how to walk. Because you cannot walk as well as I can, I will walk for you.&rdquo; Rather, he should simply let the child walk. We sacrifice many things for our children. Children break things and make mistakes all the time. However, to let them do things is worthwhile for the sake of their practice. In the same way, we should be willing to sacrifice things in the church life. We must consider the church to be a family with persons of every kind&mdash;old ones, young ones, babyish ones, stronger ones, and weaker ones. The church is not a college with a single high standard. If anyone is not up to the standard of a college, it will not receive him. We are not a &ldquo;college church.&rdquo; If we become a &ldquo;college church,&rdquo; we will be the strictest sect.</p>
<p>Some may say that if all the members function, the church will be a mess. Homes with children are often a mess. The more children we have, the bigger the mess is. This is not a bad thing; it is good. A brother may go to work in a place for two years. When we visit there, we would see a mess but we would say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; This means that there is much practice and learning in that place and that the brother working there knows how to raise up and perfect the saints. After five years he will have the peace to leave that place, because a local church will have been built up there. This is the right way.</p><h2 class="head2">Divisions Being Produced by Keeping the Church in the Hands of the Workers</h2>
<p>The more gift a person has and the bigger the gift is, the more danger there is. He will be tempted by the gift. He may think he can do everything, so it will be difficult for him to trust others to do anything. We need to stress this because we have learned from the past. Some of the local churches in the Far East have the proper practice. We can see persons produced there all the time. Co-workers are raised up, elders are built up, and deacons and deaconesses are produced because the work is carried out in the proper way. However, in some local churches this is not the case. For many years they have had only &ldquo;pastors,&rdquo; even though they do not call them that. In fact they are simply pastors, doing everything for the congregation. This is the wrong way to take. In name they are not a division, but in fact they become a division, because what is there is merely a work, not a local church built up by the work.</p>
<p>If we work in the wrong way, sooner or later there will be a division. The more we work, the more the work must be passed on to the saints, and the more the responsibility must be in the hands of the local saints. The local saints need to be raised up. Some will learn to be the called ones, called by the Lord to work for Him. Some will be built up as the elders, and some will be perfected as the deacons and deaconesses. Then whether or not workers are there, they will be able to go on by themselves. Eventually, all the matters of the church must be in the hands of the local saints.</p>
<p>If we are not clear about this, then the longer we work, the more things will be in our own hands. On the contrary, it must be that the more we work, the more things are out of our hands. After three or four years, everything should be out of the worker&rsquo;s hands. Even if he is raptured, the church still can go on, even in a better way, because the local saints will improve it. First, the saints are perfected by the worker, and then eventually according to how they are perfected, they can build upon the work and make some improvements. This is the right way, and in recent years we have been practicing this way. Sometimes people come to me and ask, &ldquo;These brothers are too young. They cannot do this job. Why do you let them do it?&rdquo; We must let them do it. We cannot stay here for our whole life, and our ministry is not to build up our work. Our ministry is to build up the local churches. Only this way can save us from making divisions. Eventually a local church must be built up under the hands of all those persons who have been perfected by the gifted ones. All the gifted persons must learn this lesson. Otherwise, the many gifted persons will make many divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Proper Way<br />
to Perfect and Raise Up All the Saints</h2>
<p>We have learned this lesson in the past. For many years there were many prevailing co-workers with Brother Watchman Nee, but no divisions were formed among us because we all learned the lesson not to keep any work in our own hands. We do not work for our own work. There is no work that belongs to us. We work only for the local churches. I can testify from the depth of my heart that Brother Nee kept nothing in his hand. His work was wholly for the local churches. It was to perfect others. I was perfected by him very much. He perfected many by his ministry. He raised up, perfected, and trained the saints to be the elders, deacons, and deaconesses in different places. We all have to learn to do this. I am not merely giving a lecture here. Rather, I beg you to put these things into practice. Always learn to do things to perfect others, not simply to do things by yourself. While you are doing things, you need to perfect others.</p>
<p>In certain large local churches in Taiwan, twenty to fifty co-workers were produced after only five or six years. In addition, many elders, deacons, and deaconesses were established. If you go there, you will realize that these are genuine, proper elders, not in position or name but in reality and in bearing responsibility. Likewise, the deacons and deaconesses have a genuine service. In other places, however, even after fifty years it is still difficult to find a co-worker who was produced there. There may be ten or twelve elders, but many are elders only in name and position. There are also deacons and deaconesses there, but they do not know how to serve. The responsibility is still in the hand of the one worker. Does this mean that the Lord had only one person He could raise up there? We cannot believe this. The Lord would have raised up more saints. The only problem is that the co-worker there took the wrong way, working all the time without perfecting others.</p>
<p>I look to the Lord. I must exercise my spirit to have the assurance that after five years in the locality where I am there will be a good number raised up, some as co-workers, some as elders, some as deacons, and some as deaconesses serving in a practical way. Moreover, after five years some must go out from this country to other countries. It is not right for us simply to meet together and fellowship without anyone being raised up by the Lord to go out for Him. After a certain time there must be some who would be willing to sacrifice everything for the Lord to go out to other countries. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace we must work this out. We cannot work it out ourselves, but if we coordinate and cooperate with the Lord, He will work this out through us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Dealt With in Our Motive</h2>
<p>There is a proper technique to learn, but first we need to be purified in our motive. If our inner motive for working in a certain place is to build up something for our own desire or purpose, it is not pure. This motive must perish. It is wrong. It is even an idol; we are building up an idol for ourselves. We need to be dealt with in our motive. We must be able to say, &ldquo;We are working here not for ourselves but for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, His Body.&rdquo; In this way many saints will be perfected. We all have to learn this, and we must also learn how to be perfected by others. This is why we have our trainings. The trainings are simply for the purpose of perfecting. I believe that after a certain number of years my responsibility will be discharged. I will be innocent before the Lord, and you all will be responsible because all these matters will be passed on to you.</p>
<p>All these matters are not insignificant, and we all need to learn them. On the one hand, we are working, while on the other hand, we are perfecting others by our working, not simply doing things by ourselves. We do things in a coordinated way so that others can be perfected by us. This is the right way. If we work in this way, eventually all the saints will be brought into their function.</p><h2 class="head1">HOLDING TO TRUTH IN LOVE AND <br />
GROWING UP INTO CHRIST IN ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>The fourth and fifth points in Ephesians 4 are growth and holding to truth, that is, holding Christ as the reality (vv. 13-15). By the proper growth we drop many things. We should not think that to grow mainly means to gain something. Rather, the more we grow, the more things we drop. The younger the children are, the more things they try to grasp. They like to collect and hold on to everything. However, the more children grow, the more things they drop, including many of their toys. To arrive at a full-grown man is to drop the doctrines and teachings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MINISTERING TO THE BODY<br />
WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE HEAD</h2>
<p>The sixth item in chapter 4 is our function. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; When we hold Christ as the reality, we grow up into Him. Then we receive something from Him to minister to others. We all have received something from the Head to minister to the Body. This is our function, which depends upon our growth and our receiving.</p>
<p>When we grow into Christ, we receive something from Him. Then we function effectually with what we receive. Our experience of Christ becomes something real to minister to others. I do not wish to criticize others, but we must realize that many Christians today are not clear about the real meaning of function. The genuine function is the ministry of the experience of Christ. We grow in Christ, and we grow into Him. When we partake of Christ, we have some experience, and we receive something of Christ. Then when we come to the church meeting, we share with others what we have partaken of. This is the real way to function.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up the Church Not by Gifts<br />
but by the Growth in Life</h2>
<p>When I was young, I had the natural concept that function is a matter of gift. In Ephesians 4, however, this kind of gift is not mentioned. When this chapter speaks of gifts, it denotes the gifted persons. Here the gift is a person, such as the apostle himself. The two sister books of Ephesians and Colossians deal with the universal man, Colossians with the Head and Ephesians with the Body. In Ephesians, the book that deals particularly with the Body, there is no mention of the gifts. Rather, this book speaks of growth. Verse 15 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; Then verse 16 begins, &ldquo;Out from whom,&rdquo; indicating that we receive something of life from Him. We can never build up a local church by the so-called gifts. Apart from life and the growth of life, the more gifts we have, the more divisions there will be. Gifts create divisions unless they are balanced by the growth of life. We cannot find such gifts in Ephesians. Rather, this book is full of life and growth.</p>
<p>In the whole of Christianity today we can hear almost no messages telling us that our function depends on the growth of life. People mostly say that function depends on the gifts, that if a person is gifted, he knows how to function. In actuality, we build up the Body not by the gifts but by the growth. We need to grow. If a person has only gifts without the growth of life, he will cause a problem in the Body.</p>
<p>I appreciate verses 15 and 16. In verse 15 there is the growth into Christ, and in verse 16 there is the function. How much we can function and minister to others depends on our growth. The more we grow up into Christ, the more we have something of Christ to minister to the Body. If we have no growth, it will be impossible to have any building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Body Building Itself Up<br />
by All the Perfected Members</h2>
<p>Verse 16 speaks of &ldquo;the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The Body builds up itself. The building of the Body is not carried out by others but by the members of the Body directly. Christ the Head does not build the church directly. He builds the church through the gifted persons, but neither do the gifted persons build the church directly. They build the church indirectly by perfecting the saints. Then it is through the perfected saints directly that the church is built up. However, all these saints need to grow. This is why 1 Corinthians 3:9 speaks of two aspects, God&rsquo;s cultivated land and God&rsquo;s building. The apostle Paul learned how to plant, how to water, and how to help people to grow, and he also learned how to build. The building depends upon the growth. For this purpose we cannot merely talk about coordination and the building up. We must help people to grow. The more growth we have, the more building we will realize.</p>
<p>If we do not know how to carry out all the above matters, we can have no confidence that we are in the real and proper church life. We will be only a group meeting together. For the proper church life we must have all these items.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">FURTHER DETAILS FOR THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:17-24</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:15-16 reveals that we are members of the Body of Christ, growing up into Him in all things. Through this growth we experience something of Christ, partake of Him, and enjoy Him. Then we spontaneously receive something to minister to others. As the members of the Body, we need to grow and function in this way. Moreover, to be normal, proper Christians is not an individualistic matter. Rather, we need to be built up. Regardless of how spiritual we are, we are wrong if we are individualistic. We need to be built up with others. It is not the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in giving all the gifts that we would be spiritual. Do not think that I am against spirituality. I am for being spiritual, but spirituality is not for itself; it is for the Body, the building. We find this thought even in Psalm 68:18, which says that Christ ascended as a man, representing man and for man, to receive men as gifts so that God may have a dwelling place among them.</p>
<p>Not only is this God&rsquo;s purpose, but it is also the target that the enemy attacks. The building is the target for all the flaming darts of the enemy. The enemy has done his best, and he will do even more, to frustrate people from this goal. God&rsquo;s intention is to have a dwelling, and it is for this purpose that He has given the many gifts. In these last days we need to realize that God is seeking to recover and to gain this dwelling place. Therefore, regardless of how spiritual we are, if we are not built up together with others, we are still wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE MIND, THE UNDERSTANDING,<br />
THE HEART, AND THE CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>After telling us these things, the writer of Ephesians goes on to give us more details. According to the composition of this book, there is the apostle&rsquo;s prayer at the end of chapter 3, and in the first section of chapter 4 he presents the practice of the church life (vv. 1-16). After this, verse 17 begins another section. It is not sufficient to speak only about the main points in the first section of this chapter. If we remain in the first section, we still have something only in theory; we are not yet in the practice. Beginning from verse 17, therefore, the apostle goes into further detail.</p>
<p>This section begins, &ldquo;This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). These verses speak of the vanity of the mind, the darkening of the understanding, and the hardness, the blindness, of the heart. Without dealing with all these things we cannot practice the proper church life. It is not possible to have the practical church life with a group of persons whose mind is full of vanity, whose understanding is darkened, and whose heart is blinded. The way to hold the reality, grow, and receive something from Christ is to deal with all these things. Our mind must be dealt with, our understanding must be enlightened, and our heart must be open, not blinded. These are the details that Paul touches in the second section of chapter 4.</p>
<p>Verse 19 continues, &ldquo;Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness.&rdquo; To be past feeling is to cast off all feeling. This relates to the conscience. To be past feeling comes from neglecting the conscience, not caring for the feeling of the conscience. All the vanity in our mind must be dealt with. This requires that our mind be renewed (v. 23). Likewise, our understanding must be enlightened, and our heart must be opened, not blinded, closed, and veiled. Our whole heart must be turned to the Lord. Lastly, we need to care for the feeling in our conscience. We must not cast off feeling. We need to deal with our conscience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING CHRIST AND PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN</h2>
<p>By all the verses in this section we can see how much detail the apostle goes into. Verses 20 and 21 say, &ldquo;But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus.&rdquo; The reality in Jesus is the reality of the life of the Lord Jesus while He was on the earth. We need to learn those things of Him. Verse 22 continues, &ldquo;That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&rdquo; The old man as a whole includes our old mind, heart, understanding, conscience, and all things of man. Because this man is old, all his thoughts, ideas, concepts, desires, love, hatred, decisions, intentions, and motives must be put off.</p>
<p>Only a person full of experience could write the book of Ephesians. The apostle Paul had the experience, and he knew the spiritual things, so he could write this short book with many profound items. This is why we need months to expound and develop even chapter 4 alone. There are many items in this one chapter. We need many messages to cover the matters of the mind, the understanding, the heart, and the conscience with its feeling. Then we need more messages to cover the putting off of the old man. The elements of the old man are not only anything that is worldly and sinful but also anything old, natural, soulish, and fleshly. We need to put these off; otherwise, there will be no way for us to have the church life. We cannot have the church life while we are still in the old man. If we use even the Bible in the old man, we will only damage the saints (cf. 2 Cor. 3:6).</p><h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:24 says, &ldquo;And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; Many things are implied by this item alone. According to the entire book of Ephesians, the new man is not merely an individual who has been regenerated and transformed. Rather, the new man is the entire Body of Christ. Verses 15 and 16 of chapter 2 show us that the new man is the Body, which includes Christ as the Head. Therefore, the new man is the mystery of godliness, and it is the new creation (1 Tim. 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:17). To put on the new man is to put on Christ and the church. We need to put off the old man and put on the new man. We should not live in the old way according to the old concept. We need to live in the church according to Christ and by Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND<br />
AS THE SECRET TO ALL THE ABOVE EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:23 says, &ldquo;And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; This one matter alone requires many messages to adequately cover it. To be renewed in the spirit of the mind is the secret to all the other points. If we are not renewed in the spirit of our mind, we cannot put off the old man and put on the new man. This is why the apostle put this word between verses 22 and 24. Between the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man there is the renewing in the spirit of the mind as the secret to the putting off and the putting on. How can we deal with all the vanity of our mind? It is by being renewed in the spirit of our mind. How can our understanding be enlightened, our heart not be blinded, and our conscience be dealt with? All these depend on one thing&mdash;our being renewed in the spirit of our mind. This is a great matter in our experience.</p>
<p>There are two spirits within us. We have a human spirit, and in our spirit is the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:16). It is difficult to know how to translate <em>spirit</em> in verses like Ephesians 4:23. <em>Spirit</em> may refer either to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. It is better to invent a new letter for our alphabet, a small <em>s</em> within a big <em>S,</em> for use in a passage such as this one. Then people will realize that it refers both to the Holy Spirit and the human spirit. No doubt, <em>spirit</em> in verse 23 is the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>To be renewed in the spirit of the mind is for the spirit to take over, possess, and saturate the mind. This means that the entire mind is now under the control of the spirit, so the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind. Since the human mind is the leading part of the soul, it represents the whole human being. Therefore, our whole being is now under the dominion and control of the spirit. Whatever we think, do, love, decide, and choose is under the control, the influence, of the spirit. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed. Then spontaneously we put off the old man and put on the new man, and we live by Christ and in the church. Our mind is cleared up from all vanity, our understanding is enlightened, our heart is open to the Lord, and our conscience cared for. All these depend on one thing&mdash;the spirit that controls our whole being, bringing it under its influence.</p>
<p>This must not be a mere teaching to us. We need to check with ourselves and put this into practice. Otherwise, we may talk about the building, but there will be no possibility to have the church life. From the first day I came to Los Angeles I declared that we cannot have the church life merely by teachings, gifts, and forms. The only way to have the church life is by being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO EXERCISE TO GROW AND<br />
BE RENEWED FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>I am thankful to the Lord for giving us the deep understanding that in Ephesians, the book on the church, the miraculous gifts are not mentioned. If the gifts were necessary for the church, why does the apostle not speak of them in this book? This is not my argument; it is what we observe in Ephesians. Rather, in this book we have the growth and our function to receive something from the Head and impart it to others. These are a matter not of the gifts but of life. Following this, we have the clearing up of the mind from all vanity, the understanding being enlightened, the heart being opened, and the conscience being cared for. These also are not matters of the gifts. In this light we can see the present situation. Even in dealing with the miraculous gifts, there is much vanity of the mind and darkness and blindness in the understanding. May the Lord be merciful to us. We need to humble ourselves before the Lord to see where we are and what we need. What we need is to grow inwardly. The church life depends upon the growth of life, and the way to grow is by all the foregoing matters.</p>
<p>This is why following the first section of this chapter, we have the second section to tell us the way to grow. The way to grow is by being renewed in the spirit that controls our mind and brings our whole being under its leadership and subduing. Therefore, we need to learn how to exercise our spirit and go along with the spirit. This is why in the New Testament, especially in the Epistles, we often find the phrase <em>in spirit.</em> We must walk, live, work, serve, pray, and do everything in the spirit. Without this, there is no possibility for us to realize the church life. Rather, we will merely be speaking about something &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need a vision, but we also must be very practical. There is the need for us to offer ourselves to the Lord once again and say, &ldquo;Lord, since I have seen this, I am willing to give myself to You again for this purpose. Renew me in the spirit of the mind.&rdquo; Spontaneously we will put off the old man and put on the new man. Our understanding will be transparent, our mind will be cleared up from all vanity, our heart will be open to the Lord, and our conscience will be at peace because we will take care of the feeling within it. Then we will be renewed and transformed persons. This is the genuine growth. Growth is transformation, and it is renewing. The more we are renewed, the more we grow. As a result, we will become very rich in our ministry, our function. In our meetings everyone will have something from the Head to minister to the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICAL MATTERS IN THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:29-30; 5:18-27; 6:10-11, 18</h1>
<p>The last portion of the book of Ephesians is instruction concerning the practical church life. We should remember that after the apostle Paul gave a full vision of the church, he offered a prayer at the end of chapter 3 specifically that we would be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our heart, that is, that He may spread, take over, and occupy our whole inward being (vv. 16-19). This is a very basic prayer for the church life. The church life is not merely outward in practice. Rather, it is something inward. We need to keep in mind that we have an inner man, a human spirit. Our inner man must be strengthened; then all our inward parts will be taken over, possessed, by Christ, and He will make home and settle down in our whole being. Eventually we will be filled unto all the fullness of God; that is, we will be fully mingled with God. This is very basic to the church life. We can never have a church life by ourselves, in ourselves, or with ourselves. The church life must be a life of our being mingled with God in which our inner man, our spirit, is strengthened.</p>
<p>Our inner man needs to be strong. Our greatest need for strengthening is not in our body or even our soul&mdash;our mind, will, and emotion. Our spirit must be the strongest part. It must be prevailing, having the first place, so that our entire being comes under the inner man and Christ has full control of it. Then there is the possibility for us to be filled unto the fullness of God. This means that we will be thoroughly, wholly, and fully mingled with God. It is in this mingling that we have the church life. This is a very basic matter, and we cannot stress it too much. We need to give message after message to stress this one matter, that our inner man must be strengthened and that Christ must take over our whole being so we can be mingled with God and filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE<br />
BEING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After the prayer in chapter 3, the writer goes into the details of the practice of the church life in chapter 4, which are mainly a matter in spirit. The first item of the practice of the church life is to keep the oneness, which is a matter of the Spirit (vv. 3-6). The last three chapters of this book do not give the ground to mere teachings or doctrines. The church life is not a matter of teaching or doctrine. It is a matter of being in the spirit. If we are in the spirit, we have the oneness, but in doctrinal teachings we have only divisions. We can never be one in doctrines. Not even a brother and his wife can be absolutely one in doctrinal teachings. We can never be one in teachings, but there is a real oneness in spirit. If we would forget about our natural mentality and reasonings and take care of the spirit within, we will be one with all the saints who are in spirit.</p>
<p>The genuine oneness is the oneness of the Spirit. Therefore, we must be in spirit. When we are out of the spirit, we are in division. In so many matters we are simply different. Therefore, we must learn to be in spirit. Arguing gets us nowhere; it only causes divisions. The situation of Christians today is like a honeycomb, full of divisions and compartments. Whenever we are out of the spirit, we are in a compartment, a small division. The genuine oneness is of the Spirit, so we need to learn to be in spirit. Almost the entire first part of chapter 4 of Ephesians is an instruction on the way to keep the oneness. The way to keep the oneness is in the spirit.</p>
<p>This spirit is the mingled spirit. The divine Spirit and the human spirit are now one. It is this mingled spirit that saturates and takes over our whole being. When our spirit spreads into our mind, we are renewed in the spirit of our mind (v. 23). The only way to be renewed is for the spirit to get into our mind to saturate, take over, possess, and occupy it. Our mind predominates our whole being, so the spirit must take control of the mind. In this way our whole being is renewed.</p>
<p>Moreover, this renewing has much to do with putting on the new man. Strictly speaking, the new man is the Body (2:15-16). Therefore, to put on the new man is simply to put on the Body. This is to have the church life in practicality. Many Christians today talk about the church life, or the Body life, but where is the Body life? The practical Body life is in the renewing in the spirit of our mind. As we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind, we are gradually putting on the new man; that is, we are gradually coming into the practice of the Body life. We began to practice the church life in Los Angeles a few years ago. Now we can check with ourselves. How much church life we have had depends on the degree to which we have been renewed in the spirit of our mind. If we have only a small amount of renewal in the spirit of our mind, we have only a small amount of church life. The church life we have cannot exceed our being renewed in the spirit of the mind. This is not a mere doctrine; it is very practical. The oneness is in the spirit, and the putting on of the new man, the Body life, is also in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING FROM THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Grieving the Holy Spirit by Corrupt Speaking</h2>
<p>Verse 30 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.&rdquo; In his writings the apostle Paul was very careful in using words and terms. This verse speaks of the Holy Spirit of God. It seems that there is no need to use the word <em>Holy;</em> we may simply say, &ldquo;the Spirit of God.&rdquo; However, holiness is the very nature of God, which relates to the previous verse. Verse 29 begins, &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth.&rdquo; Different versions translate <em>corrupt</em> in various ways. <em>Corrupt</em> may mean &ldquo;rotten, unwholesome, filthy, foul, polluted, or unhealthy.&rdquo; The Greek word has all these meanings. We must not let this kind of word proceed out of our mouth. This kind of communication is not holy; it has not been separated and does not fit the holy nature of God. Today the Spirit of God within us is the very Holy Spirit. If we speak in a corrupt way, we will grieve the Holy Spirit. According to these verses, to grieve the Holy Spirit has much to do with our speaking. Verse 29 tells us not to speak in that way, and the following verse tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit. If we speak unhealthy, unwholesome words, we will grieve the Holy Spirit.</p>

for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>The rest of verse 29 says, &ldquo;But only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; Conybeare&rsquo;s translation of this verse reads, &ldquo;From your mouth let no filthy word come forth, but such as may build up the Church according to its need, and give a blessing to the hearers.&rdquo; According to Conybeare&rsquo;s realization, building up refers to the building up of the church. His footnote for the phrase <em>build up</em> says, &ldquo;Literally, <em>such as is good for needful building up</em> (&lsquo;building&rsquo; always implies &lsquo;the Church&rsquo; or something equivalent), <em>that it may give a blessing to the hearers.&rdquo;</em> Conybeare&rsquo;s understanding is correct. What was in the mind of the apostle was the building up of the church. Colossians 4:6 says, &ldquo;Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.&rdquo; We need to speak words that minister grace to others. This kind of speech has very much to do with the building up of the church, the Body. We need to speak in a way that takes care of the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:29 says that our speaking should be &ldquo;according to the need.&rdquo; <em>Need</em> may also be translated as <em>occasion,</em> or <em>the need of the moment.</em> Whenever we speak with the brothers and sisters in the church, we must take care of the present situation of the church. We must speak in a way to meet the need of the occasion for the building up of the church. We may illustrate this in the following way. If a brother comes to talk with us, we may realize that he has a certain problem with the church, the sisters, the elders, or the young people. This is his present situation, which has much to do with the building up of the church. At this point we are put on the spot. Our proper response depends on how we speak with him. There is the need to speak something to him to meet the present situation for the building up of the church. We may talk to him in a negative way, saying, &ldquo;I agree with you. I am also unhappy with the sisters.&rdquo; This is sufficient to &ldquo;tear down the wall&rdquo; in the church. At the least, this brother will be torn down. However, if we are in the spirit and under the control of the spirit, our spirit will have the anointing and the wisdom to speak with him. We will speak in a proper way to meet the need of this occasion for the building up of the church. After our talk, this brother will be more built in and built up into the church.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities for our speaking. One is to tear down, and the other is to build up. The proper meaning of verse 29 is that we must always speak in a way that meets the need of the present occasion for the building up of the church. The Berkeley Version says, &ldquo;But only what serves well to improve the occasion,&rdquo; and the Interlinear Greek-English New Testament says, &ldquo;To improvement of the need.&rdquo; This is meaningful. Building up implies the improvement of the present occasion. When the brother mentioned above comes to speak with us, he presents a need of the occasion in that he has a problem with the church. His situation is poor, and it needs to be improved. The improvement depends on how we speak to him. We may speak in a way to improve the occasion or to make the occasion worse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking from the Anointing<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>This kind of speaking must be in the spirit and must go along with the inner anointing (1 John 2:20, 27). Otherwise, we will grieve the Holy Spirit of God, the Spirit who is holy. In order to speak with others in a proper way, we need to take care of the inner anointing. We should check to see if we have the inner anointing with peace and joy while we speak. If we have the inner anointing with peace and joy, it is good to continue our speaking, but if we have the inner feeling that the Holy Spirit is checking us from within, and we do not have peace and joy, we are grieving Him. Our speaking has much to do with whether or not we grieve the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We must admit that many times we have grieved the Holy Spirit in this way. Many times we are careless about our speaking. We may have felt that we should not speak in a certain way, but we still spoke in the way of causing damage to the building up of the church. Our speech, our word, must be good to meet the need of the present occasion for the building up of the church. Otherwise, our word will be unhealthy and unwholesome. This kind of word damages. We are here for the building up of the church. If we were not for the building up of the church, there would be no need to meet together. Our purpose in being here is the testimony of the church life. The subtlety, the wiles, of the enemy is simply to tear down this building. There is a real struggle between the building up and the tearing down. We are not complaining against any persons; we are accusing the enemy, Satan, who is doing his best to frustrate the building. Many of us are careless and unaware of how much Satan has used our mouths to tear down. We need to learn the lessons.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Gossiping but Speaking in the Spirit<br />
to Minister Grace and Life</h2>
<p>We have the oneness of the Spirit, and we have the renewing in the spirit of the mind. Now we must also have our speaking in the spirit. We must learn to speak, to communicate, with the saints in the spirit, under the control of the spirit, and under the anointing. If we have the peace and joy, we should continue to speak. Otherwise, we should stop.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:29 continues, &ldquo;That it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; Our word, our speech, can minister death and damage, or it can minister grace and life to others. The extent to which we minister grace is the extent to which the church is built up. If we minister death by our speaking, the building up of the church will be damaged, but if we minister grace and life through our word, it will be a great help for the building up of the church.</p>
<p><em>Word</em> in Greek here is <em>logos,</em> implying not only a short speech but a longer one. We need to be careful about our longer speaking. Whenever the enemy does damage to the building up of the church, he likes to use long speakings. There is temptation within us in the self-nature, the flesh, to listen to long speakings on negative things. Sometimes the more negative something is, the more we like to hear it. This kind of <em>logos</em> is not a short word but a lecture. The enemy likes to give a longer word, even for two or three hours, and we may have the inner desire to listen to it. Some even do not grow tired or hungry when they listen to this kind of word. They are so willing to listen, to hear, and to know more. Whenever this happens, we must realize that this is the tearing down by the enemy.</p>
<p>Someone may come and say, &ldquo;Do you know what happened recently between two brothers?&rdquo; Right away our ears may be attentive. If our wife were to call us to breakfast, we may tell the brother, &ldquo;Forget about breakfast. Tell me what happened.&rdquo; There is a desire within us to know these things. On the other hand, someone may read Revelation 21 in the morning and tell us that the New Jerusalem is wonderful, but we may not be impressed. When our wife calls us to breakfast, we may say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go eat,&rdquo; but we may have no appetite to hear about the New Jerusalem. We have a great appetite for gossip, especially gossip about the church. When we gossip about other things, people may not pay much attention, but whenever we gossip about the church, every ear is attentive. I learned this through many confirming experiences in the past. This causes much damage and tearing down. I say again, we are not complaining against any persons. Rather, we hate the enemy, and we hate to see how he utilizes the careless mouths to tear down the church.</p>
<p>Not only does this kind of speaking tear down, but it also spoils the materials for the building. We cannot use pieces of broken glass to make a cup. Once the material is broken, it is finished. We may not realize that some material has already been damaged by us, and it may never be recovered. The building has been damaged, and some material has been broken. This is why the apostle Paul spoke such a word in both his Epistles to the Ephesians and to the Colossians. We must be careful with our speech, with our <em>logos.</em> Our speech must be good to meet the need of the occasion for the building up of the church by ministering grace to the hearers. This also is a matter in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We find the spirit again in 5:18-21. These verses say, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.&rdquo; According to the grammar of this sentence, being filled in spirit is related to speaking, giving thanks, and being subject to one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Subject to One Another<br />
by Being Filled in Spirit</h2>
<p>Verses 22 through 24 continue, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord; for a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.&rdquo; It is by being filled in spirit that we can submit one to another. When we are in spirit, we are willing to be subject to one another. In the self no one submits to others. Submission is in the spirit. According to the context of these verses, if we do not speak, sing, and thank the Lord, we will never be subject to others. We need to be happy in the spirit. Otherwise, we will only be rebellious.</p>
<p>This passage mentions four things: being filled in spirit; speaking with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; giving thanks to the Lord; and being subject to one another. Without being filled in spirit through praising and giving thanks, no one can be subject to others. Only when we are happy can we be subject. When a sister is angry, she will not and cannot submit to her husband. A husband knows not to expect submission when his wife is angry. If he is wise, he will check to see whether or not she is happy and wait until her mouth is full of thanks and praises. Then she will submit.</p>
<p>Submission comes from being filled in spirit. When we are filled in spirit, we are full of praise and thanks to the Lord. At this time we are able and willing to submit to everyone. In the church there is the real need of submission. A building must be vertical, not flat and horizontal. If I say that I do not want to be under you, and you say that neither do you want to be under me, then we are &ldquo;flat,&rdquo; and there can be no building. In order to build up something vertically, there must be submission. I must be under you, you must be under someone else, and he must be under yet another person. This is the proper submission. Some may ask, &ldquo;Why must I be under that person?&rdquo; To ask this is to produce a question mark, which is the form of a serpent when it rises up. Question marks in the church life are the sign of the serpent. This is a real damage; it is poisonous. In the church life there is the practical need of subjection. When we are subject to one another, we are able to be built up.</p><h2 class="head2">Receiving the Word in Spirit to Be Washed<br />
by the Water in the Word</h2>
<p>Verses 25 through 27 say, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.&rdquo; Verse 26 speaks of the washing of the water in the word. It is by this washing that the church is sanctified and cleansed, and all the spots and the wrinkles are purged away. In the church life today stains and dirtiness do not cause much damage. It does not matter if my hand is dirty or has paint on it, because I can wash this away in a short time. However, spots are something of the natural life, and wrinkles are related to oldness, so not even the best soap can wash them away. Today the enemy causes many spots and wrinkles in the church. He does his best to cause a great amount of oldness. We have been meeting together for only two and a half years, but some may already have become old. Nothing but the inner life can deal with all these spots and wrinkles.</p>
<p>Sanctifying and cleansing are a matter of the word. The washing of the water in the word is a matter of the life ministered to us by the word. In the word of God there is always the element of life. When we are in spirit and reading the word, the word ministers life to us, and this life is the water that washes away all the spots and wrinkles. When we take the word by our spirit, it becomes life, and this life is the washing water. The word can be life to us only when it is in the spirit. In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; When the word is received in our spirit, it becomes spirit to us. Then it ministers life to us, and this life within is the washing water, sanctifying and cleansing us of all the spots and wrinkles. All this is a matter in our spirit.</p>
<p>If we have a problem with a brother, we can never solve it by talking and reasoning. We may think that we should clear up the misunderstanding, but the more we try to clear it up by talking about it, the more complicated it will be. We can never explain anything clearly enough once a problem occurs. Rather, that is the human concept, even the temptation from the enemy. The only way out of this situation is to forget about our reasoning and turn from our natural mentality in the soul to the spirit. Then the spirit will work something out. As long as we are in the mentality, reasoning, arguing, and trying to convince others, the Lord&rsquo;s word will not be life to us when we read it. Regardless of how many chapters we read, there will be no life. It is only when we turn to the spirit and then come to the word that we receive life. Therefore, the way to help others is to help them to turn from their mind to the spirit.</p>
<p>If someone comes to us to reason and argue, we may be tempted to convince him by our own reasonings. If we do this, we will be trapped by the enemy. This is the natural, wrong way. We need to learn the lesson how to help this kind of person. Once we realize that he is in his mind, we should help him to turn from his mind to his spirit. If he turns to the spirit and then comes back to the word, the word will give life to him. Then this life will wash away the spots and the wrinkles. Spots and wrinkles can be washed away only by life. In this way the church will be sanctified and cleansed from all spots and wrinkles because all death will be swallowed up by life. Then the church will be holy and without blemish. This again is something in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
TO FIGHT THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE</h2>
<p>Verses 10 and 11 of Ephesians 6 say, &ldquo;Finally, be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil.&rdquo; Then verse 18 says, &ldquo;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.&rdquo; The last aspect in Ephesians is the spiritual warfare, and the key, the secret, of this warfare is the spirit. We need to know how to pray in spirit. If there is a problem among the saints, we should not deal with it directly. Rather, we must learn to pray in spirit to fight the battle. It is by means of all prayer and petition in spirit, not by talking and reasoning, that the problems are solved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Strengthened in the Spirit and<br />
Avoiding the Temptation to Listen to Problems</h2>
<p>We need to pray in spirit. When we confront a difficult situation, we should keep ourselves entirely away from the problems there. Even if people come to tell us the problems, we should shut our ears and not listen. That is the best way. However, again there is the natural temptation to dig out all the problems. When we go to a certain locality, we may like to know everything. This is a real temptation, and it is no help to ourselves or to the church there. The more we become &ldquo;deaf, blind, and dumb&rdquo; in a situation, the better it is. Our spirit needs to be strong. If it is, there will be no need for anyone to tell us the problems. We may not know the details, but in our spirit we will know the situation in principle.</p><h2 class="head2">Talking and Reasoning Never Availing<br />
to Solve the Problems in the Church Life</h2>
<p>We can never solve problems by talking them over. In my whole life I have never seen one problem solved by talking. This only wastes our time and gets us wrongly involved. The only way to fight the battle is to pray in the spirit. This is why whenever I go to other places, I shut myself off from hearing the negative things. I do not like to hear and know these things. We cannot help people by the way of listening to this kind of speaking. Sisters, if you know that certain other sisters have a problem, do not go to talk with them. If you go to talk with them, you will get involved. Let them talk among themselves. When their talk burns up all their natural fuel, the fire will stop by itself. Do not add yourself to the fire as more fuel. It is foolish to jump into their fire as more material to be burned. Many who do this are still not satisfied. They call in other saints to foolishly jump into the fire with them. Then instead of three pieces of &ldquo;firewood,&rdquo; there are six or seven. Then when the first three are burned out, the fire keeps burning with new material, and you yourself become the material to burn. This is a real problem in the church.</p>
<p>Keep yourselves away from this burning. Let the &ldquo;firewood&rdquo; burn itself. This kind of talk cannot last very long. After a few years those involved will see the need to stop. I have learned this secret in the past, so I am passing it on to you. Do not be fooled. We can never solve the problems by talking about them. Do not waste the time, and do not damage yourselves by becoming material for the fire. Rather, we need to pray in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INSTRUCTION CONCERNING<br />
THE PRACTICAL CHURCH LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We need to keep the oneness of the Spirit, be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and not grieve the Spirit, but rather speak things that are good for the building up of the church. Moreover, we must be filled in spirit to be subject to one another and pray in spirit to fight the battle. If these five points were removed from the last three chapters of Ephesians, these chapters would be meaningless. These five points related to the spirit are vital to this portion of the Word, which speaks about the practice of the church life. This proves that the church life is entirely a matter in the spirit. If we are truly practicing the church life, we all need to learn the lesson of turning to the spirit, both by ourselves and with others. It is only in the spirit that the church life can be realized and all the problems can be solved. There is no other way.</p>
<p>We must learn to be in the spirit, exercise the spirit, and speak in the spirit. We also need to learn to forget about our natural mentality, our reasonings, and our talking. The fallen mind and the mouth work together too much. We must learn to divorce these two. Then we will know how to exercise the spirit, and the gossiping mouth will become a praising and thanking mouth. Our mouth will be full of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, and giving of thanks. We can testify from our experience that the longer we talk in a gossiping way, the harder it is to preach. After two hours of talk we may not be able to pray for a few days. However, the more we stop our talking and forget our reasonings and our fallen mentality, the more we are full of praises. Sometimes we may even praise with tears and say, &ldquo;Lord, praise You. Hallelujah!&rdquo; Then we will also pray, not mainly for ourselves but for others and for the church. We will genuinely be in the spirit. We all need to see that the church life is a life not of teaching or reasoning but a life in the spirit. We cannot get through our misunderstandings by reasoning. If we learn to turn from our mind to the spirit, everything will be cleared up, not through the mind but in the spirit. We all need to learn this.</p>
<p>I would ask you to spend some time with the Lord to review all the matters concerning the practice of the church life in the last three and a half chapters of Ephesians. Also, you should pray much while you read these chapters from Ephesians and the messages we have spoken here. This will become a great help to us, and others will be helped through us. Then we all will realize the proper way to practice the church life. These messages are in the way of instruction that we may see the proper way to have the church life. We must be strengthened into the inner man. This is the basic foundation for the church life. Then the spirit will spread into our mind to renew us, and we will learn how to speak with others under the control of the spirit, not grieving the Spirit but building up the church.</p>
<p>From now on whenever we speak something damaging to the building up of the church, we must feel that we are grieving the Holy Spirit, and we should not have peace. Now more than ever we need to take care of our speaking. We must never speak anything that may cause damage, even if it seems good in some way. It does not matter whether something is good or bad, or right or wrong. What matters is whether it builds up or tears down. Our speaking must be for the building up. If we speak in this way, the Holy Spirit within us will be happy; otherwise, He will be grieved. Moreover, we must learn to be filled in spirit and to have praises, thanks, and subjection to one another from the infilling Spirit. Finally, we need to learn to pray in the spirit.</p>
<p>All of the above are the key passages in the last part of the book of Ephesians, showing us the proper way to have the church life. If we neglect these few points, we will not have the way to build the church, regardless of how much we know. Furthermore, we must remember that neither of the two important books that deal with the Head and the Body&mdash;Colossians and Ephesians&mdash;stress mere doctrines, forms, or gifts. Rather, they stress the strengthening of our inner man, the renewing of the mind by the spirit, walking and speaking in this spirit, and being filled in spirit. This is a matter of the inner life. It is in this way that we have the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE VISION OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING<br />
AND THE TEST OF OUR SPIRITUALITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 28:10-19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">All the Visions in the Scriptures Being<br />
Related to God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>The building up of the church is the aim of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and plan. It is the central point, the ultimate aim, of God&rsquo;s purpose according to all the visions and revelations in the Scriptures. The first vision mentioned in the Scriptures is Jacob&rsquo;s dream in Genesis 28:10-19. Before that time the God of glory appeared to Abraham (Acts 7:2), but that was not a vision to Abraham. The first vision in the Scriptures was Jacob&rsquo;s dream. The central item of that vision was Bethel, the house of God, built with two kinds of material, stone and the oil poured upon the stone. The stone signifies man, and the oil signifies the very God who comes to us as the Spirit. After Jacob poured the oil upon the stone, he called the name of that place Bethel. The stone with the oil poured upon it became the house of God. This is the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>The Spirit, who comes to us, is the third person of the Triune God. The Father was far away from us, and the Son was once among us yet not in us. It is the &ldquo;oil,&rdquo; the person of the Spirit, in whom and by whom the very God comes into us to be one with us, producing Bethel, the house of God. Therefore, the first vision in the Scriptures is a dream, the central point of which is the house of God built with human beings mingled with the Triune God.</p>
<p>Today Christians often talk about heavenly or spiritual visions, but it seems that they are not clear concerning the central visions in the Bible. Visions in the Scriptures are always related to God&rsquo;s building. There is a principle of first mention in the Scriptures; that is, the principle of a matter is set forth when it is mentioned for the first time. The first vision in the Scriptures is a vision of God&rsquo;s building. Accordingly, the visions in the Scriptures are always related to God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The final vision in the Scriptures is the New Jerusalem, in the last two chapters of the Bible (Rev. 21&mdash;22). This is an enlarged vision, a vision in full. The vision at Bethel is the seed of the vision, and the vision of the New Jerusalem is the harvest of the vision. Between these two ends, there are a number of visions in the Bible. Moses saw a vision of the building of the tabernacle (Exo. 25&mdash;31). That was a genuine vision of the heavenly pattern for God&rsquo;s building. As the vision of Bethel was a seed, Moses&rsquo; vision on Mount Sinai was the growth of the seed. After Moses, the next major vision was that of David, the vision of the temple as the enlargement of the tabernacle (2 Sam. 7:1-16). Following this were the visions of Ezekiel. According to Ezekiel 40 through 48, the temple that Ezekiel saw was a further enlargement of the temple seen by David. Zechariah&rsquo;s vision was related to the recovery of the temple, and Daniel&rsquo;s visions are related to the temple in the end times. The next great vision was that of the apostles, represented mainly by Peter and Paul. The Epistles show us the vision of the church that the apostles saw in their own time. The final vision was seen by John.</p>
<p>It is surprising to hear Christians often speaking about visions, because many do not realize that all the visions are for the building. Some brothers have studied the Scriptures in seminaries and Bible institutes, but they may have never heard of the vision of God&rsquo;s building. If we take away the above visions from the Scriptures, there will be none left. With these visions we have the seed, the growth and enlargement, the recovery, and even the enlargement of the enlargement. In the New Testament visions we have the genuine article, the church, and in Revelation there is the ultimate manifestation of God&rsquo;s building, the New Jerusalem. All these visions are related to one item&mdash;the building of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Need to See the Vision of God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>Because this is the age of God&rsquo;s purpose, we need to have not a mere teaching or doctrine but a vision. Beginning in 1939, Brother Watchman Nee spent three years to stress one matter&mdash;our need to see the Body, which is the building of God. He stressed that we need a vision of the Body. To hear something about the Body is one thing, but to see the Body is another. We may compare this to hearing about Los Angeles before we actually see it. I heard of Los Angeles many years ago when I was young, but I did not come here until 1958. Now I have a clear view of Los Angeles, especially when I travel by airplane. We need a vision to see God&rsquo;s building, not merely to hear, learn, or know about it. We cannot say exactly how we can see the vision, but as we are seeking the Lord, meeting together, and fellowshipping about this matter again and again, we eventually will see something. Before that time, we may have known about the building of God, but eventually the vision will be open to us, and we will see it in our spirit. If we are open to the Lord and seek Him, sooner or later the building of God will become a vision to us.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire in the universe is the building. This is His aim and His ultimate goal, and He will obtain it. If we seek Him and His desire, we must go along with Him in this matter. We cannot be satisfied until we see His people built up in a practical way. David was called a man after God&rsquo;s heart because he had a genuine concern for God&rsquo;s dwelling place. He was occupied by nothing other than the building of the dwelling place of God, not in heaven but on this earth and in his age. Today we also must have a true concern for God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth.</p>
<p>Many Christian brothers and sisters are very concerned for lost souls. Whenever I hear this, I am very happy. I too would do whatever I can to further the work of the gospel. However, today the Lord is doing something more, not only to preach the gospel and save lost souls but also to bring the saved ones to be built together. We must have a true concern not only for the lost ones but also for God&rsquo;s building among the saved ones. This is the purpose for which we are here. We do not despise any kind of gospel work. We must do whatever we can to help the gospel work, but we also need to see something further. We need to see the vision of God&rsquo;s purpose with His building. We are not here merely for the gospel or for spirituality. We are here for God&rsquo;s ultimate goal and aim, which is the building up of the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need to Build Up the Bride of Christ<br />
on the Proper Ground of Oneness</h2>
<p>Recently a brother spoke with me concerning prophecy and the world situation, telling me how he felt that the end of time is very near. The end may be near, but it may not be as near as some think. In 1936, when Mussolini was in power, the great Bible teacher D. M. Panton published the pictures of Mussolini and Caesar Nero side by side, saying that Mussolini was the Antichrist and that this was a strong sign that the time for the Lord&rsquo;s coming was near. At that time I was working in Tientsin, the biggest seaport in northern China, close to the capital of Peking. After reading Mr. Panton&rsquo;s paper, I had the definite understanding that it was not accurate. My feeling was confirmed simply by considering the condition of the building up of the church. Christ will return as the Bridegroom, but a bridegroom comes for a bride. Where today is the real building up of the church as the bride of Christ?</p>
<p>Some may ask how it is possible to be identified in oneness with all the members of the Body of Christ. In order to answer this, let us consider the picture, the type, of the people of Israel. At the time of Solomon when the temple was first built, all of God&rsquo;s people were in the same place and on the same ground. At that time it was possible and even easy to identify with all of God&rsquo;s people. Later, some of God&rsquo;s people were captured away to Egypt, some to Syria, and some to Persia, while most of them were taken away to Babylon. Under this dispersion it was no longer possible to be identified with all the people of God. If someone was identified with the group in Egypt, he was separated from all the other groups. To identify with even the biggest group, the one in Babylon, was to not be identified with the rest of the people of God. We should not ask how it is possible to be identified with all of God&rsquo;s people. Under the present dispersion, in the time of captivity, it is not a matter of choosing with whom we identify ourselves. What matters is that we receive the command of God to come back to the very place appointed and ordained by God. We must come back to Jerusalem, as Ezra and Nehemiah did. Those who came back to Jerusalem with Ezra and Nehemiah to stand on the proper ground of the temple became a living testimony. They became the building of God in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It was not a large number of the captives who came back, perhaps not even ten percent. In the same way, there is no doubt that the Lord spoke to all the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, but His concern was to gain the overcomers. In this age of degradation what matters is not how many of the Lord&rsquo;s people we seem to identify with. What matters is that we take the standing that the Lord commands.</p>
<p>After the day of Pentecost there was no need for those in Jerusalem to take a standing with a particular people of God. All the believers were identified with one another simply because they were all in one place, standing on one ground. Later, however, the church was divided. Consider the situation of division today. There are some living members of the Body even in the Catholic Church, but this does not mean that we should go to the Catholic Church to identify ourselves with these members. In the degradation, captivity, and dispersion today, it is not a matter of choosing with whom we identify ourselves. It is a matter of coming to the proper ground to take the stand that God ordains.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for a Remnant<br />
to Go Outside the Camp unto Christ</h2>
<p>Today God needs a remnant, a small group of overcomers to take the stand that was lost by the whole church. For this reason we need to see a vision and not simply consider the situation according to our natural and religious concept. We need to see something according to God&rsquo;s eternal plan. We may compare the situation today to the smog in Los Angeles. Many days it is difficult to see the mountains through the smog. Under the smog everyone&rsquo;s vision is veiled. We need to be transcendent, to rise above the smoggy air. Then we will see the vision.</p>
<p>Today some are still considering how to identify themselves with all the members of the Body. If they try to do this, they will not succeed. This is not the nature of the present age. The age today is a time for some overcomers to listen to the voice of the rejected Lord, the One who is outside the camp (Heb. 13:13). There is no need to try to &ldquo;identify&rdquo; with the ones still in the camp. Rather, come out of the camp and go unto the Lord to follow Him and accomplish His purpose. We could never be more inclusive than the Lord is. The Lord Himself went out of the camp. We must go along not with the religious concept and the human thought but with the heavenly vision. Go outside the camp unto Him.</p>
<p>May the Lord be merciful to us. We need a vision. The Lord can testify that I am grateful to Him for the evangelistic ministry in America today. Thousands of people have been brought to the Lord, yet I am not satisfied only to see that thousands of lost souls are saved. I desire to see even only a small number of them listen to the Lord&rsquo;s voice, go unto Him, and be built up together as a living testimony. These will be the bride of Christ mentioned in Revelation 19:7-8, the overcomers, not simply the wife of the Lamb in eternity mentioned in 21:2 and 9.</p>
<p>We need to see the vision and not merely have a general concept. Regardless of how people condemn and criticize us, we should disregard their speaking. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was always criticized by the religious people, by those who had the Scriptures in their hands. He was also crucified by those people according to their understanding of the Scriptures. We should not be affected by all the criticisms. We need the vision of God&rsquo;s building. Without a vision, all the things we have spoken here are in vain. Once we have the vision, everything is different; the whole universe is changed. I am limited in my ability to speak these things, but I trust in the Lord according to my prayer that what I have spoken here is not my own word but the revealing Spirit unveiling the vision of God&rsquo;s building. The Holy Spirit will unveil these things to you so that you may see the vision of the building. There is no other vision in the Bible. All the visions in the Bible are for the building, which is the very aim of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING BEING<br />
THE TEST OF OUR SPIRITUALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Genuine Spirituality Being for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>In addition to seeing the vision of God&rsquo;s building, we also need to see what the building is in practicality. The building is the test of every kind of spirituality. We ourselves are not the standard by which our spirituality is tested for its genuineness. Rather, we must put our spirituality on the doorstep of the building to be tested. You may be very spiritual, but you may be too individualistic. The individualistic spirituality is not the genuine one. The genuine, real spirituality must be for the building. If someone considers that he is spiritual, yet he is independent, individualistic, and isolated from the Body, his spirituality is a deception.</p>
<p>Someone may be very humble, but whether this humility is genuine and spiritual or false and natural can be tested only by the building. There are many humble persons, but they are too independent. They are not related to anyone. They are individualistically humble, humble in an isolated way. We may have nice, good, and humble brothers of this kind among us, and we may all appreciate such persons. However, if we have a vision &ldquo;from a mountaintop,&rdquo; we can look down and see the actual situation. Let us tear down this kind of natural humility. It is too individualistic and isolated, and it even damages. There is no relatedness with this kind of humility. True and genuine spirituality is for the building. If we can have the building up, then to be proud or humble does not matter. We do not want to be praised by others for our humility yet damage the building with it.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s concern, what matters is not our spirituality. Strictly speaking, God is concerned not for spirituality but for the building. Regardless of how good, humble, and spiritual we consider ourselves to be, let us be tested. How much are we in the building? How much are we built up and related with others? God&rsquo;s aim is not to have a group of nice Christians. His aim is to build us up together. He does not want precious stones in a museum for an exhibition. He wants to have a house built up with the precious materials. You may be precious, but you are still not built up with others. If this is the case, you are good only for an exhibition; you are not good for the building. God made the precious materials for the building, not for an individualistic display.</p>
<p>In a certain place some saints recommended a sister, saying, &ldquo;She is so spiritual. She is quiet and always so nice to everyone.&rdquo; In actuality, this sister was nice to everyone, but she was not nice for God&rsquo;s building. She had been in that city for many years without being related to anyone. She was considered very spiritual, but she was not connected. She was nice in an isolated, individualistically spiritual way that was not for the building up of the Body. We must not appreciate this kind of spirituality. The test of our spirituality is the building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Applying the Test of the Building<br />
to Solve All the Problems<br />
and Answer All the Questions</h2>
<p>In a certain place there were two parties of brothers who were dissenting and fighting with one another. Eventually both parties came to me, wanting to see which side was right and which was wrong. After I listened to both groups for a long time, they said, &ldquo;We know that you will not take sides, but we still wish to know how you feel. If you say we are right, we will receive your word, and if you say we are wrong, we will receive that also.&rdquo; At that time I did not check to see who was right and who was wrong, as if by using the law of Moses. Rather, I applied the test of the building. I checked with them, saying, &ldquo;Brothers, please consider how much you are in the building. Is what you are doing here good for the building? Is it a gain for the building, or is it a loss? Does it help the building, or does it frustrate it? You may be entirely right, but you are still a hindrance, a frustration, to the building.&rdquo; Then some of them prayed with tears: &ldquo;O Lord, forgive us. We felt that what we were doing was right, even according to the Word, but we have been damaging the building.&rdquo; Then the other brothers said, &ldquo;We are clear now. We too have been damaging the Body.&rdquo; On that day many brothers became clear, not by checking with the law of Moses but by the test of the building. They wept, prayed, and repented to the Lord, asking Him to forgive and deliver them. From that time onward, no one among those brothers spoke of who was right and who was wrong. They realized that it is not a matter of right and wrong but of whether or not we are built up together.</p>
<p>Today is not the day of the law. Today is the day of the building up of the Body. What God is seeking after today is not that we keep the requirements of the law but that we fulfill the requirements of the building. We must be built up. This is the real test of our spirituality. Even if we feel that we have not seen the vision, we should still put ourselves and specific things about us on the test of the building. If we do this, we will see the difference.</p>
<p>It is difficult for someone to be truly related with others if, for example, he has secret, unconfessed sins and inner, hidden things. As long as we have something that condemns our conscience, we cannot be built up with others. In order to see things properly and rightly, we need to have the right standing, the right angle. Without the test of the building we may have a certain angle, but if we apply the test of the building to many matters, our point of view will be completely turned around. We will see things from a different viewpoint. Then as long as our point of view is changed, our problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Today is not the day of the law or of spirituality. This is the age for God&rsquo;s building. The building of God is our standard and test. We need to test ourselves not concerning right or wrong but by how much we have been built up. This is the test, and it is also the solution for all of our problems and the answer to all of our questions. How much have we been related to our dear brothers and sisters? How much are we one with them in the spirit in love, life, and reality? Satan hates this oneness and harmony. He endeavors to do whatever he can to damage the oneness. Once we lose this oneness, we lose our impact. Our impact is in the oneness of the building. When we are truly one, in harmony, and built up together as one Body, we have a real impact.</p>
<p>We need to see the vision of God&rsquo;s building, and we need to test our life, work, move, motive, intention, desire, and point of view by the building up of the Body. If we apply the building as the test, we will be fully and thoroughly revolutionized, and we will have a real turn.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
BY THE GROWTH IN LIFE AND<br />
THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:21-22; 4:14-16; 1 Pet. 2:2-5; Gen. 2:9; Rev. 21:18-21; Matt. 13:1-33; 44-46; 1 Cor. 3:9-12; Rev. 22:2; 21:2; Rom. 12:2</h1>
<p>The building up of the church depends on our growth in life. Without the growth in life there is no possibility for the building up. The building up is also by the transformation of the soul. It is not only by our being cleansed to deal with the negative things but also by our being transformed positively in our entire being. Moreover, the building up is in our human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
BY THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Our Growth in Life Being<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:21-22 says, &ldquo;In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; The word <em>growing</em> is the key word of verse 21. The way to become the temple of God is by growing. In verse 22 the key phrase is <em>in spirit,</em> which has no article in Greek, as some versions render. The dwelling place of God is in our human spirit. These two matters&mdash;growing and &ldquo;in spirit&rdquo;&mdash;are the basic factors for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Verses 11 through 16 of chapter 4 are one long sentence joined by several connecting words. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; The Lord as the Head gave all the gifted persons to His Body as gifts. These are gifts not of ability but of persons. All the gifted persons given as gifts are for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ (v. 12). Verses 13 and 14 continue, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; Here Paul speaks not of the wind of heresy but the wind of teaching. We should not think that only heresy is a blowing wind. Even sound, fundamental, and scriptural teaching can become a blowing wind.</p>
<p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; The truth here is Christ Himself. We hold Christ as the truth, the reality, and grow up into Him not only in one thing but also in all things, in all aspects, and in all directions of our life, in all that we are in our whole being. Verse 16 concludes, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; This verse again tells us that the growth in life is for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:2-3 says, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.&rdquo; Verse 23 of chapter 1 speaks of regeneration. In regeneration we were reborn as spiritual babes. Now as the newborn babes we need to grow. If we have tasted that the Lord is good, we will truly desire to take the milk of the Word that we may grow. Verses 4 and 5 of chapter 2 tell us the purpose for the growth in life. These verses say, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The holy priesthood is the spiritual house built up by the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Two Lines of Life and Building<br />
in the Scriptures</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Israel as the Fig, the Olive,<br />
the Vine, and the Wheat</h2>
<p>There are two lines in the Scriptures: life and building. In Genesis 2, at the very beginning, there was the tree of life (v. 9). A tree is for growth. Immediately following this, verses 11 and 12 speak of precious materials: gold, bdellium, and onyx. To see what precious materials are for, we need to come to the end of the Bible. In Revelation 21 we see a city built up with gold, pearl, and precious stones (vv. 18-21). All the precious materials are for the building.</p>
<p>As the people of God in the Old Testament, Israel is often compared to a tree or a crop. Israel is likened to a fig tree, an olive tree, and a wild vine (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8; 11:16; Psa. 52:8; 80:8, 14; Isa. 5:2; Ezek. 15:2). Figs and olives are for eating, and the vine produces wine for drinking. Therefore, the people of God are likened to something for food and drink. Moreover, in Luke 10 the good Samaritan poured oil and wine on the wounds of a man who had been beaten (v. 34). Here oil and wine are not for food but as medicine to heal the wounds. This is what the people of God must be. The people of God are fig trees to produce food, olive trees for oil, and the vine to produce wine. They are for satisfying people and for healing them. In addition, the people of Israel are also wheat to produce fine flour and cakes for the meal offering to satisfy God (Lev. 2:1-2, 4). The thought of the Scriptures is that the people of God are either a tree or a crop. This is the aspect of growth.</p><h2 class="head3">The Tabernacle and Temple Being Built through the Growth of the Produce of the Good Land</h2>
<p>The people of God are also typified by the temple as God&rsquo;s dwelling, His house, in the Old Testament. The tabernacle and the temple were the issue of growth. The people brought the surplus of their growth and offered it to God as materials to build up His house. Both the tabernacle and the temple were built with the offerings of the Lord&rsquo;s people, and these offerings came from the growth of their produce. Therefore, the main thought of the Old Testament is that God&rsquo;s people are a tree and a crop to grow, and by this growth they are built up together as a dwelling place for God.</p>
<p>The children of Israel also defeated the Lord&rsquo;s enemies, the pagan tribes, who occupied the good land (Josh. 23:4-5). Defeating the enemy is for the growth of life. If we do not defeat the enemy, we cannot come into the good land. Then after coming into the good land, we grow the produce of the good land. This growth of life is for the offerings, and the offerings are for the building up of the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Growth and Building<br />
in the Parables of Matthew 13</h2>
<p>The parables in Matthew 13 are in two groups. The first group are the parables of the sower and the seed, the wheat and tares, the mustard seed with its growth, and the flour and the leaven. The basic thought of this first group of parables is growth. The sower sowed the seed with the hope that wheat would grow (vv. 1-23), but the enemy came in to sow tares to frustrate the growth of the wheat (vv. 24-30). Next, the mustard seed should have grown to be an herb to feed people, but the enemy came in again to change its nature and form a great tree from this little herb (vv. 31-32). This also changed the purpose of the seed. The purpose of a mustard herb is to feed people, but the purpose of a tree is to lodge the birds as the evil spirits. Nevertheless, the Lord is sovereign, and some of the wheat produced genuine flour. However, the enemy came in once again to add leaven to corrupt and ruin the pure, fine flour (v. 33). The seed, the wheat, the herb, and the flour all convey the thought of growth.</p>
<p>The second group of parables in Matthew 13 comprise the parable of the treasure hidden in the field, which must be gold or precious stones, and the parable of the pearl of great value (vv. 44-46). Once more, both precious stones and pearls are the materials for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Growing as God&rsquo;s Cultivated Land<br />
to Be Built Up as His Building</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3:9 says, &ldquo;For we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; There are two aspects in this verse expressed by two clauses. On the one hand, we are God&rsquo;s cultivated land to grow, and on the other hand, we are God&rsquo;s building to be built up. These two thoughts always go together.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Tree of Life and the Holy City<br />
at the End of the Scriptures</h2>
<p>At the end of the entire Scripture there is the tree of life once again, and there is a city (Rev. 22:2; 21:2). The line of growth and building go together throughout the entire Bible, from the very beginning to the very end. On the one hand, we are something of the vegetable life to grow, and on the other hand, we are the building, the house, the dwelling place, to be built up by the growth in life. The more we grow in life, the more we are built up together.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Building with the Precious Materials<br />
of the Triune God</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3:10-12a says, &ldquo;According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it. For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones.&rdquo; Here again there is the thought of the proper materials for the building. Precious stones, like pearls, are transformed materials.</p>
<p>There are three items in this category, not two items or four. According to spiritual insight, the three precious materials signify the Triune God. Gold signifies the nature of God the Father, silver signifies the redemptive work of Christ the Son, and precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit. We were born of God the Father to receive the gold, that is, His nature. We have been redeemed by the redemption of God the Son, and now we are under the process of transformation by the work of God the Spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 12 also speaks of another category of materials: wood, grass, and stubble. Wood is versus gold, grass is versus silver, and stubble is versus precious stones. Wood signifies humanity, grass signifies the flesh, and stubble signifies earthly and worldly things. Therefore, these three materials indicate the natural man with the natural life, the flesh, and the worldly things.</p>
<p>The above verses show us that the building up of the church is by the growth of life. The two lines in the Scriptures of growth and building always go together. The church is a tree or a crop to grow, and out of this growth of life comes the building.</p><h2 class="head2">The Genuine Relatedness in the Church<br />
Being by the Increase of Christ within Us</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Only the Increase of Christ Availing<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>Life is Christ, and growth is the increase of life, so the growth of life is the increase of Christ within us. Man is a tripartite being, having a spirit, soul, and body (see diagram below). When we were first saved, Christ came as a small seed into the innermost part, our human spirit, but He did not yet fill our soul. Now He needs to increase, and this increase is the growth of Christ as life. We can never build up the church in the way of an organization. Regardless of how strong an organizing hand may be, that hand can never build the church. The church can be built up only by the increase of Christ within us, that is, by the growth of life. The more we grow in Christ, the more we will grow into the building.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/VisionPractice/three-part_man.jpg" width="384" height="209" alt="" /></p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters have the one Christ within them, but the Christ in each of them is separated by the two &ldquo;outer circles,&rdquo; the two layers of the soul and the flesh. If this is the case, there is no real relatedness between the saints. The Christ in one brother longs to be joined with the Christ in another brother, but the layers of the soul and flesh become a wall to separate their portions of Christ. Only the growth, spreading, and increase of Christ within them can overcome this separation. For Christ to increase in us means that Christ takes the ground in us and spreads within us to saturate not only our soul but eventually even our body (Rom. 8:6, 10-11).</p>
<p>Although Christ has come into our spirit, we may still have no relatedness with others. This is because even though Christ may have overcome one brother&rsquo;s problems, another brother may still have his problems. One brother may have genuine spirituality, but if the other brother has not given the ground to Christ, there can be no relatedness between them. When one day this brother loves the Lord, not according to his religious way or point of view, but according to a heavenly vision, he will give the ground to Christ. Then Christ will saturate, increase, and spread within him. Then the two brothers can be genuinely related. The relatedness between them will be the spreading Christ, the very Christ who takes over their entire being. This is the genuine building up. The building up of the saints in oneness depends absolutely on the increase of Christ within them. This relatedness is nothing less than Christ Himself. Therefore, the building up of the church is Christ Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Relatedness in the Church<br />
Requiring Us to Be Defeated and<br />
Possessed by the Lord</h2>
<p>How much we are built up depends on how much we have the increase of Christ within us. This increase of Christ depends on the decrease of the self. Christ must increase, and we must decrease. We can never be built up in our natural life. There is no need to point out the impossibility of Chinese, Japanese, British, French, and Americans being built up together in the self. Even Americans from different regions of the country cannot be built up in the self. Similarly, there is no need to say that different races cannot be built up together. Even brothers of the same race from the same place cannot be built together, because each one has his own particular disposition. A brother cannot be built up even with his own wife. There is no relatedness in ourselves. In ourselves there is only separation and individualism. The real relatedness, oneness, and building up is Christ Himself. When Christ overcomes, conquers, defeats, and takes full possession of us, He can join Himself to the Christ in others.</p>
<p>We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, conquer and defeat me. Lord, never allow me to defeat You. Never allow me to win the battle.&rdquo; The real building up of the church depends on the Lord&rsquo;s defeating us. The more we have the victory over the Lord, the more we are separated, but the more He defeats us, the more He can build us together. We need to be defeated by the Lord. He must defeat us and take possession of us.</p>
<p>We should not consider that we can be one by having the same understanding of doctrines. I observed a small Brethren group in which all the people had the same understanding of doctrines. They were all of one mind concerning the tribulation and the rapture. However, almost every week they fought with one another. In another place, however, I observed a different situation. Certain dear ones were not one in doctrine, yet they were very related in Christ. Some of them preferred to baptize by immersion in water, but others preferred sprinkling. However, they could still testify that they were one. Satan knows where there is oneness, and he hates it. Nevertheless, we are in this oneness. Although we may be of different minds as to doctrine, we have a wonderful oneness in the spirit.</p>
<p>We can never be one in our natural disposition. Everyone is peculiar in his disposition, but praise the Lord, He can defeat us! He can conquer us and take possession of us. As long as He can do this, there is the genuine oneness among us. This relatedness between us is nothing less than Christ Himself who conquers us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
BY THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Transformation Requiring<br />
That Our Natural Disposition Be Dealt With</h2>
<p>The building up of the church is by the transformation of the soul (Rom. 12:2). As we have seen, we can be one not in ourselves but only in the conquering Christ. A sister may be very nice, humble, and gentle, but she may still be very natural. She may have a nice soul with a nice mind, a loving emotion, and a very soft will, but there may be only a small portion of Christ within her. It is difficult for a person with such a nice character and personality to be related in oneness with others. The most individualistic persons are the nicest ones. It is easier for even the sloppy ones to be one with others, because they are less individualistic.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a person who is nice and good in everything to find a companion. Whoever chooses the most proper person as his or her spouse will constantly suffer due to the spouse&rsquo;s individualism. A husband will never be able to come up to the standard of the most proper wife, and a wife will not be able to come up to the standard of the best gentleman. In the church I am more afraid of the nice ones than of the sloppy ones. The nicest ones are the most difficult to deal with. Nevertheless, whether we are sloppy or nice, we all must be conquered by Christ. Not only do those with bad dispositions need to be conquered by Christ, but those with even the best dispositions must be conquered. Otherwise, there is no possibility for us to be related with the other members of Christ. We can never be related to others in our self. We must be related in Christ. When we all are conquered by Christ, we spontaneously are related.</p>
<p>In actuality, it is not easy for Christ to take over either the nice ones or the sloppy ones. It is very difficult to build up the church due to the stronghold of these natural dispositions. The problem is not sin. Because everyone condemns sin, it is easy to overcome. However, not many condemn their disposition. More than twenty years ago there was a church in my hometown. At that time there were two brothers who were &ldquo;poles&rdquo; apart. One was very nice, and the other was sloppy. When the nice one came to someone&rsquo;s home, he would first knock on the door. When the owner answered the door, the brother would ask permission to come in, and when he was inside, he would wait to be offered a seat before he sat down. Then after he used a cup, he would return it to the proper place. He did everything nicely and in order. However, when the other brother came into a home, he would take his own seat, not where the guests sit but at the owner&rsquo;s desk. Then he would say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty.&rdquo; As he drank the tea, he would spill some on the floor, and when he was finished, he would leave the cup carelessly. Eventually, these two brothers argued with each other over the matter of disposition. One brother felt that the other&rsquo;s disposition was a hindrance to the Lord, and each one justified his own disposition.</p>
<p>This illustrates that everyone acts according to his own disposition with a certain amount of self-justification. In serving the Lord and dealing with many Christians in many places, I discovered that no one is willing to condemn his own disposition. This is why it is foolish to try to correct people. One brother may like to go to bed early and rise early, but the brother he lives with may not rise until an hour later. If these two try to correct one another, they will not succeed. Rather, each one will be fully offended and will want to move out. It is foolish to try to correct others in this way. If our roommate likes to go to bed late, we should let him do it and not bother him. We can never succeed to correct him. We can only offend people, and eventually we also will be offended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Transformation Requiring<br />
That Christ Take Full Possession of Our Soul<br />
and Swallow Up Our Disposition</h2>
<p>Our disposition is very troublesome. The only way to deal with it is for Christ to defeat it. If we love Him according to a heavenly vision and we give Him the glory, He will take full possession of us and He will swallow up our disposition. This swallowing up is the transformation of the soul. When our soul is transformed and our flesh is conquered, we will have true relatedness.</p>
<p>I am not passing on a mere doctrine about the building of the church. Rather, this is the practical experience for the building. The building of the church is possible only by the growth of life with the transformation of the soul. We need to be transformed by being conquered by Christ. The more we are willing to be conquered by Him, the more He will take over us and transform us in our soul. Then spontaneously we will have oneness among us. We will have the real building up of the church. This is what the enemy hates because this is the very thing that puts him to shame.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING IN OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:17; 2:22; 3:5, 16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18</h1>
<p>In the previous messages we have seen that the building up of the church is God&rsquo;s aim and purpose, and this building is the test of our genuine spirituality. Moreover, the building is by the growth in life and the transformation of the soul. In this message we will consider how the building up of the church is absolutely in our human spirit. The human spirit is mentioned in each of the six chapters of Ephesians, which is a book on the church. This proves that our spirit is strongly related to the church life. In order to have a practical church life, we must know our human spirit, and we must be in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN SPIRIT IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:17 says, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.&rdquo; The spirit mentioned here is not the Holy Spirit; it is our human spirit. In order to practice the church life, we need an enlightened human spirit, one that is full of wisdom and revelation. Then we will be able to see the spiritual and heavenly things not in the mind, in the soul, or even in the heart but in our spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 22 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Again, <em>spirit</em> here is not the Holy Spirit. It is not logical to say that the Holy Spirit is the dwelling place of God. The Spirit is not the dwelling place but the Dweller. The habitation, the dwelling place, of God is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 5 of chapter 3 says, &ldquo;Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit.&rdquo; <em>Spirit</em> here is the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God. It can be considered the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit. Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church is revealed to the apostles and prophets. We need the same kind of spirit to see such a revelation.</p>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; The inner man is our regenerated human spirit. Our regenerated spirit needs to be strengthened. The issue of the strengthening of our spirit is that Christ makes His home in our heart. The heart is mainly the soul, being composed of the mind, emotion, will, and the conscience. When our spirit is strengthened, Christ takes over our soul to make it His home. Not only our spirit but also our soul becomes His dwelling place.</p>
<p>Christ came into our spirit as only a small seed. Therefore, our spirit is somewhat weak. However, every descendant of Adam, the unbelievers and the believers alike, is strong in his mind. The spirit of the unbelievers is deadened. The spirit of the believers has been made alive, renewed, and regenerated, but it is still too weak. It is difficult to practice the church life if our spirit remains weak. That is why the apostle Paul, after he released the vision of the church, bowed his knees to pray specifically that we may be strengthened into our inner man, that we would be strong in our spirit, not in our mind. When we are strong in our spirit, Christ who is in our spirit has the ground and the opportunity to spread from our spirit to take over our mind, emotion, and will. Then our whole being with all our inward parts&mdash;mind, emotion, will, and conscience&mdash;will be possessed by Christ. Christ will make His home in our heart and occupy our entire inner being.</p>
<p>Verse 19 concludes, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; Because all the fullness of God dwells in Christ (Col. 2:9), and Christ possesses our whole being to make His home there, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. This means that we will be fully mingled with God as life. This experience in the spirit is necessary for us to practice the church life.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:23 says, &ldquo;That you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; When our spirit is strengthened, Christ spreads from our spirit into our mind. At that point the spirit subdues and possesses the mind, and the mind comes under the rule, the control, of the spirit. In this way the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind. Verse 23 is between verses 22 and 24. Verse 22 speaks of putting off the old man, and verse 24 of putting on the new man. The secret to putting off the old man and putting on the new man is to be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>Verse 18 of chapter 5 says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&rdquo; According to the Greek text, there is no article before <em>spirit.</em> Strictly speaking, this verse speaks of being filled not with the Spirit but in our human spirit. Verse 18 presents a contrast between the body and the spirit. To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, but to be filled in spirit is to be filled with Christ, who is all that God is, the fullness of God. We should no longer be filled in our body by drinking wine. Instead, we need to drink Christ as the fullness of God for the filling of our spirit. We all need to be filled in spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 18 of chapter 6 says, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; Again, the Greek text has no article before <em>spirit,</em> indicating the human spirit. We need to pray at every time not only with words but in our spirit. Our prayer must be something of God and Christ. To pray merely with words from the mind is to pray by ourselves, which is not a genuine prayer. However, when we pray in the spirit, we have a genuine prayer, and Christ prays within us.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS IN THE HUMAN LIFE AND CHURCH LIFE BY OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to the six chapters of Ephesians, our spirit must be enlightened to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation; this is the beginning of God&rsquo;s dwelling within us. Our spirit must also be strengthened so that Christ may gain more ground to take possession of our whole being. This spirit becomes the spirit of our mind to take over, subdue, and control our mind. Then we need to be filled in our spirit and pray at every time in our spirit. If we have such a spirit, we will have no problems with the building up of the church. If a husband and wife have a spirit that is always enlightened by God and full of wisdom and revelation, a spirit that is the dwelling place of God, a strengthened spirit that always gives Christ more ground within them, a spirit that takes possession of their mind, a spirit that is filled, and a praying spirit, they will have no problems in their marriage life. All the problems among the married couples come only when they are out of their spirit.</p>
<p>When I was younger, brothers and sisters would come to me with the troubles of their marriage life and family life. At that time I always told them to open their Bible to Ephesians 5:24-25. They already received the teaching from this passage on their wedding day, but I would try my best to remind them of it. This was foolish. Every time I did this, I failed myself and I failed them. I failed in this way for a period of many years. Eventually I learned that such teaching does not work. There is another verse in Ephesians 5, verse 18, which says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit.&rdquo; Their problem was that they were out of the spirit. If they would simply return to the spirit, open to the Lord, and speak to Him, their problems would be solved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE POINT OF VIEW OF OUR SPIRIT<br />
TO PRACTICE RELATEDNESS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>A marriage life is a related life. Many times a husband does not tell his wife before he goes somewhere. Sometimes wives also act independently. This is because they have not realized that after being married, they now have a related life. After getting married, a husband must not only tell his dear wife where he is going, but he may also need to ask her permission. In order to be a good husband or wife, one must always go to his or her spouse before doing anything. To keep the relatedness in this way removes all the misunderstandings. It causes the family life to be full of joy and the husbands and wives to be happy with each other.</p>
<p>In the same way, the church life is also a related life, an enlarged marriage life and family life. Therefore, we all need to learn to be related. However, whenever we are in our mind, we are separated, not related. Relatedness can be realized only in our spirit. This is not mere knowledge; it is something practical for the building up of the church. Sometimes we may say, &ldquo;Let us come together and thoroughly discuss the situation.&rdquo; This may help in a small way, but we need to be careful. The more we talk in the mind, the more problems we have. When we have a problem, the secret is to say, &ldquo;Brothers, let us stop our talking and pray a little.&rdquo; We need to stop the exercise of the mind and pray. To pray is to come back to the spirit and exercise the spirit. After everyone prays, we are restored to oneness. Whenever we come back to the spirit, we are immediately in the oneness.</p>
<p>We may again illustrate this with the marriage life. Whenever husbands and wives are not happy with each other, they are in the soul, either the mind or the emotions. The problem is never with the spirit. The best way to help the situation is for them to turn from the mind and the emotions to the spirit. If they turn to the spirit, they will be happy. When a husband is in his mind or emotion, he looks at his wife from the angle of the mind and emotion. When you look at my face from the front, you can see my eyes, but when you look from behind, you see only my hair. In the same principle, if a brother looks at his wife from the point of view of his mind, he will quickly become unhappy with her. However, when he turns to his spirit, he looks at his wife from another angle. His view is different because his angle has changed.</p>
<p>Many times we have problems with the dear ones in the church life simply because we exercise our mind too much. The more we exercise our mind to look at the brothers and sisters, the more problems we have. We need to turn to our spirit whenever we have any problem with the brothers and sisters. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, help me not to look at my brothers and sisters in the mind. Help me to turn to the spirit and consider the saints from my spirit.&rdquo; Then we will see from another angle. The situation will still be the same, but our view will be changed. The reason it is easy to be angry with people is that we are too much in the emotion. If we turn to the spirit, however, our angle will change, so our view of the saints will be different.</p><h2 class="head1">AVOIDING INVOLVEMENT IN PROBLEMS<br />
BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Throughout all the years in the past and in all the places I have been, I have learned this lesson. We all have a heart for the Lord, we have seen the vision of the church, and we desire to practice the genuine church life. However, in our real situation there are still troubles. The unique source of all the troubles is that often we are not in the spirit. When we are in the spirit, even when there are problems in the church, we are not bothered and we do not get involved with them. When we are not in the spirit, though, we only add more fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>I believe that this is what was in the spirit of Paul as he wrote the book of Ephesians. As he wrote this Epistle, he was clear that the church life can be realized only in spirit and in love. As we have seen, the phrase <em>in spirit</em> is mentioned several times in this book. Paul also uses another phrase, <em>in love</em> (3:17; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2). We should bring all the problems to the Lord and turn to our spirit. Then we will view the problems from the spirit. It is not that the situation will change. The situation will be the same, but our view will be different, because we will look at it from another angle. Moreover, we will be kept from involvement in the problems. We will not need others to rescue us from the problems, but we will be in the position to rescue others.</p>
<p>If we see a problem between brothers or sisters, we may have the good intention to help the situation. However, we need to realize that if we are in the soul and not in the spirit, there is the danger that we may get involved with the problem. Originally the problem may have involved only two persons, but if we get involved in our soul, more people will be added to the problem. We will only add more fuel to the fire. As long as we are in our soul, we will only get involved negatively. It is in this way that Satan, the subtle one, takes the ground to increase and enlarge the problems in the church. Rather, we should be quiet and cool down our mind and emotion. Then we must go to the Lord in the spirit to wait on Him in prayer. We should not exercise the mind or the emotion; we should simply contact the Lord in the spirit for a certain amount of time. Then we will see the difference. The situation may not change, but our view will change, and with this view we will be kept away from negative involvement. We will be in a position to help and even rescue the situation. This comes by our not being in the soul but being in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we look at matters with our mind, we will have a certain point of view, but if we look at them with a spirit of wisdom and revelation, we will have a different view. We always need to turn to the spirit, and we need to have a spirit that is full of wisdom and revelation. In addition, we need our spirit to be strengthened. We must be stronger in the spirit than in the mind. We also need our mind to be subdued under the control of the spirit. For our spirit to be the spirit of our mind is genuine transformation.</p>
<p>If we consider a certain brother with our mind, we may be disgusted with him and think he is hopeless. We must learn the lesson to realize that our poor, troublesome mind needs to be subdued by our spirit. We need to turn to the spirit, look to the Lord, and have our mind subdued by the spirit. If we do this, then we will look at the same brother from our spirit and be full of hope. The brother may still be the same, and his situation may not have changed, but our view will change because we will look at him from our spirit. This is not a mere doctrine. It is something we can put into practice in our daily life. Sometimes after exercising my mind I have asked the Lord, &ldquo;Be merciful to me. I do not want to be in the outer court or even in the Holy Place. I want to be in the Holiest Place in Your presence.&rdquo; By being in the presence of the Lord in this way, my view was changed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR HUMAN SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1 our spirit is enlightened and filled with wisdom and revelation. In chapter 3 our spirit is strengthened, and in chapter 4 our spirit subdues and takes over our mind. Then in chapter 5 our spirit is filled with Christ, who is the fullness of God. We are filled not with something for the body, but even the more we are filled with God in our spirit. Finally in chapter 6 we pray at every time in spirit. If we are in the mind it is impossible to pray at every time. The more a brother considers his wife with his mind, the more he is unable to pray. This kind of exercise of the mind keeps him from praying. However, if he turns back to the spirit and considers things from the spirit, he will pray at every time in spirit with all prayer and petition.</p>
<p>I am so grateful for the Word of God. Ephesians presents a proper order, a sequence. First, our spirit is enlightened to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Then it is strengthened, and it brings the mind under its control. Following this it is filled with Christ as the fullness of God, and it becomes a praying spirit. If this is our condition, we will have no problems. The real building up of the church can be realized only in this kind of spirit. Eventually, we will be the habitation of God in spirit.</p>
<p>How much we always need to turn to our spirit! We should not receive this merely as a doctrine. We need to practice this. Whenever there is a problem in the church with the brothers and sisters, we must practice to turn to the spirit. We should never try to reason. Reasoning gets us nowhere. Likewise, we should not try to debate, for debating only brings in more confusion. Rather, we must learn to quiet our mind, cool down our emotion, and turn to our spirit to stay in the presence of the Lord for a certain time concerning all the problems before us. Then to be sure, we will have another view of the situation, and we will be kept from negative involvements. We will be in a position to rescue those who are involved and be a real help to the situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RESTRICTED BY OUR SPIRIT<br />
TO HAVE A BALANCED RELATEDNESS IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>On the positive side, we will be very related to all the others who are also in the spirit. Our real relatedness is in the spirit, and this relatedness in the spirit is the true building up of the Body. Sometimes we see in the church that certain ones are too related to one another. This is not the genuine relatedness but something natural. It simply indicates that the persons involved are not in the spirit. If we are in the spirit, we will not be overly related. Rather, we will be related to a proper extent, because whenever we are in the spirit, there is always the proper restriction. We will realize that we can love and deal with a brother only to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In our spirit there is both a release and a restriction. In this way we are kept from being overly related with anyone. If we do not have this balance in the spirit, we will eventually have divided and divisive parties among the brothers. One group of brothers will be overly related; another group will be related among themselves but not to the first group. We all must reject both being unrelated and being overly related. We must have a balanced relatedness. Whether or not we like a certain brother, we need to have the proper relatedness in our spirit, and at the same time this relatedness must be restricted by the spirit. Then we will have the proper and genuine relatedness with all the brothers. Whether or not we like someone, we still need to keep the balanced relatedness in our spirit. Then whether we are happy with the brothers or not happy, there will be no parties. Rather, the relatedness among us will always be balanced. Through this kind of balanced relatedness we will have the genuine building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FIVE PRACTICAL MATTERS<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-3</h1>
<p>Bible students agree that the book of Ephesians may be divided into two sections. The first section of three chapters gives us a revelation, a definition, of the church, showing us what the church is, from where it comes, and where it stands. Then the second section of three chapters shows us how to realize the church life in a practical way. At the opening of the section concerning the practice of the church life Paul says, &ldquo;I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace&rdquo; (4:1-3). Many of us are very familiar with verses 24 and 25 of chapter 5, which are a charge to husbands and wives. In addition, many Christians who talk about the church life pay attention to the seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo; in 4:4-6: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God. However, not many Christians pay adequate attention to verses 1 through 3.</p>
<p>Paul was a prisoner not merely in a physical prison, and he was not only imprisoned for the Lord; he was a prisoner in the Lord (v. 1). He had lost his liberty in the Lord. As such a one he besought the Ephesians to live a life worthy of the calling with which they were called. As a young Christian I thought that God&rsquo;s calling was for us to go to heaven. According to the whole book of Ephesians, though, our calling is to practice the church life. Ephesians is not a book about the heavens nor even about salvation. It is a book on the church. This book tells us that God has called us for the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s election of us includes two ends. At one end is His choosing, and at the other end there is His calling. His choosing was in eternity, but His calling is in time. According to 1:4-5 God predestinated us, He marked us out beforehand for His eternal purpose concerning the Body of Christ. Likewise, His calling in time is also for the Body. We need to have a walk, to live a life, worthy of our calling for the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT, WHICH IS CHRIST HIMSELF AS THE SPIRIT WITHIN US</h2>
<p>The first item of the Christian walk that is worthy of God&rsquo;s calling is that we must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. According to the Greek text, to be diligent includes the meaning of striving and struggling. To keep the oneness is not an easy matter. This oneness is already within us, so there is no need to attain, gain, or receive it. What we need today is to keep, preserve, and maintain what we already have gained. For this purpose we need to be diligent, and strive, struggle, and even fight to keep, maintain, and preserve the oneness.</p>
<p>Just as the current of electricity is the electricity itself, the oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself. At the time we believed in the Lord Jesus, this wonderful, inexhaustible Spirit came into us as the oneness. We know this in a practical way because we have loved the brothers and have wanted to contact them since the day we believed in the Lord Jesus and He came into us. Before I was saved, I saw many Christian preachers and ministers, and I was raised under them, but I hated them and all Christians. I used to say, &ldquo;Look at those poor Christians. I would rather follow Confucius. The followers of Confucius are much better than the Christians.&rdquo; This was my slogan. However, on the day that I was saved, the whole universe changed for me. Christians became so dear to me. I loved everyone who said that he was a Christian, and I wanted to be with the believers. Sometimes when people ask me how they can know if they are saved, I reply, &ldquo;Do you now love the believers?&rdquo; If anyone says that he still hates Christians, I do not believe that he is saved. At first I thought this was my own concept, but then I read 1 John 3:14-15, which indicates that the love for the brothers is a proof that we have eternal life within us.</p>
<p>Therefore, the genuine oneness is the very Spirit who is within us. Every real Christian has this oneness, which is nothing less than the living Lord Himself as the wonderful, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit who is within us (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b). Now what we need today is not to receive or gain this oneness but to endeavor, strive, and struggle to keep, maintain, and preserve the oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIVE PRACTICAL MATTERS<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Five phrases in Ephesians 4:1-3 give us the practical way to keep the oneness: <em>lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, bearing one another in love,</em> and <em>the uniting bond of peace.</em> We should not quickly think that we know what all these terms mean. We may know the meaning of these phrases from the dictionary, but we may not know their reality. We can know mainly from our experience what these matters are. According to my experience and learning in the past, these five items are a test to us in the practice of the church life. By this test we can see whether or not we are practically in the church life.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Setting Up a High Standard,<br />
but in Lowliness Loving the Weaker Ones</h2>
<p>First, we should never set up a high standard for others. To not set up a standard is the real practice of lowliness. Because by the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty I was born and raised in organized, formal, and fundamental Christianity, I have contacted many different schools, sects, and denominations. Although some are good, it is difficult to find any that do not raise up a high standard. Some claim the cross as their standard, and others say that holiness, the inner life, or spirituality is their standard. I met a small group of persons who even claimed that their standard is the fullness of Christ. Even the fullness of Christ can be a high standard that we set up. As long as we take something other than Christ as our standard, we do not have lowliness. If we put forth a high standard, we are not lowly in our mind and attitude.</p>
<p>Neither the subjective experience of the cross, the resurrection life of Christ, the gift of speaking in tongues, healing, or mission work is our standard. To have a mission work is not wrong. Likewise, to speak in tongues, to have healing, to preach the cross, to have the resurrection life, and to practice holiness are not wrong. What is wrong is to make these a standard. Regardless of how good, heavenly, or spiritual something is, as long as it is something other than Christ Himself, it will cause division. That is why today there is a &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; church, for example. Even if a group does not denominate itself based on a standard, in principle it is still a division. We should not even claim that Christ is our standard in a divisive way.</p>
<p>Claiming a spiritual standard has caused much damage in the past among all the Christians. The more spiritual Christians are, the more they kill others spiritually, because once someone becomes spiritual to a certain extent, he sets up that spirituality as a standard for others. In this way, his spirituality becomes a killing to others. Those who set up a standard often say that certain persons do not come up to their standard. This is a killing. Regardless of what kind of person one is, we should treat him or her as we treat everyone else. Many times it is easy for us to treat spiritual people in a good way, but it is not easy to treat weak ones, young ones, and wandering ones properly. This kind of different treatment damages the church life. In the church and among Christians we need to treat everyone in the same way, regardless of his or her spirituality.</p>
<p>Whether or not someone is spiritual and whether or not he loves the Lord much, we must treat him as we do others. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we should treat those who do not love the Lord even better than we treat those who do. If there is a backslider and a spiritual leading one before us, whom will we love more? This puts us on the test. We probably would love the spiritual person more, but this is not right. We all should love the backslider more. The other brother is spiritual already, so he does not need our love and care as much. The poor backslider, however, certainly needs our care. If we were to love him, he may no longer be a backslider. He will be brought back by our love. Many times it is simply our cold attitude that makes someone more of a backslider. He may not come back to the church simply because he cannot bear the cold faces. The weaker ones, the younger ones, and the backsliders need more love. From my past experience I have learned that in the church we should not overly appreciate the spiritual ones. Rather, to love the weaker ones, the fleshly and soulish ones, and the ones with problems will solve most of their problems. Otherwise, we will set up a high standard out of pride and not lowliness.</p>
<p>If we do not set up a standard, we will have true lowliness. We will be lowly minded, not highly minded. We will love the weaker ones, the younger ones, and the backsliding ones because the Lord loves them. According to the four Gospels, when the Lord was on this earth, He showed more love to the sinners and tax gatherers than He did to the good ones. This was true lowliness and humility. To have real humility is to set up no standard among us. This is the practical way to have the church life. The church life is very spiritual, but there are also many backsliders in the church. The church is a family, not a college. In a college almost everyone is in the same age bracket, from about eighteen to twenty-three, but in a family there are also younger ones, weaker ones, and even babyish ones. The family life is a picture of the church. Twenty years ago I stressed our standard of spirituality more than I do today. Today I can stand before you and say that in the church we should never set up a high spiritual standard for others. Rather, we must love everyone, even the worst ones. This is to practice genuine lowliness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sacrificing Ourselves to Be Meek in Our Attitude</h2>
<p>Verse 2 next mentions meekness. To not have a high standard is a test of our motive concerning lowliness. Our motive must be to love everyone in lowliness regardless of a standard. Meekness, however, is a matter of attitude. Our attitude must be one of meekness. The Greek word for <em>meekness</em> implies mildness, gentleness, and unselfishness. Our attitude in the church must be mild and meek. Therefore, we have no excuse; we all need to be broken. If we are selfish, we can never be genuinely meek. Rather, our meekness will be false. Only unselfish people have genuine meekness. In order to be meek, we must sacrifice ourselves. The more we sacrifice ourselves, the meeker we will be. If someone takes our Bible and does not return it, for example, it will be difficult to be meek in our attitude toward him. However, if we have a sacrificing spirit, we will be willing to sacrifice a Bible for our brother. We will say, &ldquo;Never mind. Praise the Lord! Please use it.&rdquo; This is to be meek in our attitude.</p>
<p>In this message I am not expounding Ephesians 4:1-3 in the way of mere Bible teaching. Rather, I am speaking according to my experience. If two brothers sit next to each other, one may be careless and kick the other one. Similarly, if two sisters sit together on a small bench, one may take up too much room, and the other will struggle to get back her half of the bench. These are tests in small matters, but they involve a big principle. We must be willing to sacrifice ourselves regardless of how we are treated. If we are willing to sacrifice and be unselfish, we will be mild and meek. Only selfish people are hard and harsh.</p>
<p>Our attitude comes out of what we are. If we are selfish, we will have a hard, harsh attitude. If we are unselfish, we will always be mild, meek, and gentle in a genuine way, not in a false way. In the church life we need this attitude, not a harsh, hard, or cruel attitude. Once in a certain restaurant a waiter spilled a cup of soup on my back. If I had loved my jacket, I would have said harshly, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Instead, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I was able to be meek. I told the ones with me, &ldquo;Be at peace. Do not be bothered.&rdquo; Unselfishness produces meekness, mildness, and gentleness. In order to have the proper attitude, we must not be selfish.</p>
<p>We must learn to have the proper attitude. We should not claim that our heart is sincere and our motive is right. That is not good enough. Only the Lord knows our motive. We are not the Lord; we are human, and we cannot see someone&rsquo;s motive. We can only see his face and attitude. It is not possible to speak harshly to a brother while claiming to have a good heart and motive. Therefore, in order to keep the proper church life, we must all learn to be adjusted in our attitude. In this matter we need true brokenness.</p>
<p>In many local churches the problems come mostly from wrong, careless, cold, and harsh attitudes. To have a right attitude is not a small matter. Satan, the subtle one, will utilize even a little carelessness in the way one brother greets another. He will fire a flaming dart into the brother&rsquo;s mind (6:16), and when the brother is in bed that night, he will have troubled thoughts about the other brother&rsquo;s attitude. This will create a certain amount of trouble. The next day that brother will be harsh to the other one, causing the other brother to have a further reaction. Eventually, the one careless greeting will cause a chain reaction; there will be a schism between the two brothers, and many misunderstandings will result. I am not speaking this in a speculative way. I have seen problems in the past due simply to this kind of reaction, which was due to nothing less than a little carelessness.</p>
<p>In order to have the church life, we need to learn that it is something very fine, not rough. According to the type, the church is a cake made of fine flour (Lev. 2:1-5; 1 Cor. 10:17). Anything coarse or rough does not fit the church life. I do not mean that we need to be nice in a worldly or religious way. Rather, we must have a fine expression toward the brothers and the sisters, behaving and conducting ourselves in a fine way. Our attitude is the most important item. If we would trust in the Lord for a proper attitude, we will be saved, delivered, and kept away from many misunderstandings. Almost all the misunderstandings come out of careless attitudes. Satan always utilizes careless attitudes to attack the church. This is why we must be careful with others, not for their sake only but even more because of the subtle one. The subtle one is here among us, so we need to be careful. We must not have carelessness in our attitude that can be taken advantage of and used for an attack by the enemy.</p>
<p>Meekness is a matter of an unselfish attitude that is mild and gentle, never argues for oneself, and never makes an excuse for oneself. Again I say, I am not presenting Ephesians 4:1-3 according to mere Bible teaching. I am speaking something from my past experience concerning the practicality of the church life. I suffered much due to carelessness in my attitude in the early years of my ministry, although the Lord can testify that my motive was pure. My motive was good, but people could not see my motive; they could see only my attitude. Therefore, we must be careful in our attitude and always be meek, mild, gentle, nice, and without excuses. Otherwise, we will have a wrong attitude, and this wrong attitude will be an advantage taken by the enemy in order to attack us. This is not a small matter. It is very serious.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Long-suffering by Being Restricted<br />
in Our Speaking</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:2 also speaks of long-suffering. According to my experience, long-suffering is related to our spoken word. In the church we must be careful concerning our speech and conversation. To keep from speaking something according to our particular desire is a real suffering. If we can bear this suffering, we can bear any suffering. A brother may wrong us, but for the Lord&rsquo;s glory and for the sake of the church life, we should not speak a word about it. This is the exercise of long-suffering mentioned in verse 2. If we have not learned this lesson, then whenever something happens to us, we will talk about it. If a brother wrongs us, we will tell our spouse immediately, and then we will use the telephone to tell the story to someone else. Since we are not able to bear our suffering, telling people about it puts us at ease. To utter, express, and talk about everything that happens to us requires no long-suffering or patience.</p>
<p>If we see the leading brothers quarreling, we may immediately go to relate this to another brother. To do this may make us feel very light and at ease, and the more we talk in this way, the more we enjoy it. However, if we have learned the lesson, for the Lord&rsquo;s glory and for the sake of His church we will not say a word. Instead, we will go to the Lord with tears. If our dear wife comes in and asks why we are weeping, we will simply say, &ldquo;It is nothing to concern you. Praise the Lord, Hallelujah!&rdquo; To say, &ldquo;It is nothing&rdquo; is not a lie, because in fact it is nothing to concern her. There is no need to say something to others. Rather, we should have long-suffering. If we learn to keep our words in such a proper way, we will realize the true meaning of the word <em>suffering</em> in the church life.</p>
<p>On the contrary, though, we often do not suffer because we prefer to speak. We like to talk about whatever we see and whatever happens. There is no burden or yoke to bear in this improper practice. Immediately after a message is given, we may begin to criticize the speaker, saying, &ldquo;That was a poor message. His language was broken, his accent was not right, his utterance was not very impressive, and I disagree with his emphasis.&rdquo; The more someone talks in this way, the more comfortable he may feel. Again, if we have learned the lesson, we will say nothing negative about the ministry, despite what we feel about it, for the sake of the practice of the church life. Our mouths will be under the control of the Holy Spirit. If when we return home, our children ask what the speaker said, we will be careful with our words. If we practice this, we will suffer in a proper way.</p>
<p>Our speech and conversation damage the church more than anything else. Some like to speak in person, and others like to write letters. It seems that there is no need to pay Western Union for a telegram. If something happens to the ministry here, within a few days many churches overseas will already know about it. We have many &ldquo;correspondents&rdquo; and &ldquo;mailmen&rdquo; who work without pay to deliver the news. If something happens on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the next morning a &ldquo;church mailman&rdquo; will come to tell you about it. This is not a rebuke. Rather, it is my observation for more than thirty years. Word after word is passed on by telephone calls, letters, and personal contact. This builds up nothing but instead damages the church.</p>
<p>If we consider our past, we will realize how much we have been involved in this practice of passing on stories, unconsciously creating rumors. Once a story is second hand, it begins to change, and eventually it can become a great exaggeration. This is always the case with rumors. In order to learn the lesson of long-suffering, we need to experience the suffering of restricting our mouth and stopping our tongue. We may see and hear many things, but we should not speak a word without the anointing and leading of the Holy Spirit. We must not let the enemy use our tongue for his purpose. Regardless of what happens to us, even if a brother wrongs us, we should not say a word. If we have learned the lesson of long-suffering, we will not enjoy our improper speaking. Instead, we will suffer by saying nothing. This is the proper meaning of long-suffering in verse 2.</p>
<p>We have been practicing the church life in Los Angeles already for three years. If we consider the past, though, we will see how much damage comes from speaking too freely. Through our carelessness in speaking we have caused much trouble. We have caused others to suffer, and we ourselves also have suffered. Eventually, I made the decision to have long-suffering instead of another kind of suffering. Either way we will have suffering. If we do not suffer through long-suffering, we will suffer in a negative way by our speaking. It is better to choose long-suffering. Then we will be saved from the wrong kind of suffering, and the church life will be kept from damage. No one taught us this lesson in the way of Bible teaching, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have learned this from our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bearing One Another in Love<br />
to Avoid All Fear and Suspicion</h2>
<p>Verse 2 ends with &ldquo;bearing one another in love.&rdquo; In order to bear one another in love, we need to fight against suspicion and fear in the church life. Instead of these two things, we should have only love. To have suspicion towards a brother means that our love is gone. Then after suspicion, fear will follow. If two brothers are suspicious of each other, they will be like spies to one another. This will produce a mutual fear between them. In order to realize the practical church life, we all must rise up to fight the battle against suspicion. If there is no suspicion, there will be no fear of one another.</p>
<p>We must give no ground to suspicion and fear. We love our brothers; we do not fear them. First John 4:18 says, &ldquo;There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.&rdquo; We are not in a political circle, where even the leaders are suspicious of one another. We should never be suspicious of one another, and we should not try to spy on one another. If certain brothers say something about us, let them do it. We should not try to find out what they are saying. We should not go to a brother and say, &ldquo;Please tell me what they were talking about.&rdquo; If we do this, we are acting as politicians, not brothers. Rather, we should leave this matter to the sovereign hand of the Lord. We can tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, if it is Your will that I should know, and if it is for Your glory and the good of the church life, You will let me know through some channel.&rdquo; There is no need for us to ask what someone said. Because we have no suspicion of the brothers, we have no fear of them either. Therefore, there is no need to spy.</p>
<p>Sometimes when certain brothers have come to tell me something, I realize what they are doing, so I say, &ldquo;Brothers, please say no more. Do not go on.&rdquo; It is always a temptation to know others&rsquo; attitude toward us, how they consider us, and what they have said about us. In order to realize the church life, we must reject this temptation. We must have no suspicion. We believe in the Lord and consider that all the brothers are good. Therefore, there is no need to know too much. Regardless of how others consider us and talk about us, we are in the hand of the Lord. If we practice in this way, the door will be closed to the enemy.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, someone is suspicious, this will cause a reaction, and this reaction will cause a chain reaction. Then in the church we will have not love but only suspicion and fear. We will have a church full of &ldquo;policemen.&rdquo; We will become not a police state but a &ldquo;police church.&rdquo; On many occasions we have suffered much because of this. A brother might report, &ldquo;I saw three brothers talking in their house until midnight,&rdquo; or he may inquire, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we see that brother in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting?&rdquo; This kind of speaking is the underground work of a spy. This damages the church. It does not build up; instead, it kills and tears down. If we truly intend to have the church life, we must learn the lesson to be careful in our speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit<br />
in the Uniting Bond of Peace</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:3 says, &ldquo;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.&rdquo; If we have peace only with God and not with all the brothers, we have lost the church life. The church life is tested by the peace we have, not only vertically with God but also horizontally with all the brothers. We need this kind of peace. We should not be over- related or under-related to anyone. The uniting bond of peace is the balanced relatedness in the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">HAVING ONE MIND, ONE OPINION, <br />
AND ONE SPEAKING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 1:27; 2:1-2; 4:2; 1 Tim. 1:3-7</h1>
<p>First Corinthians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&rdquo; First we have the same mind, then we have the same opinion, and eventually we speak the same thing.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:27 says, &ldquo;Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel.&rdquo; This verse proves that the spirit is different from the soul. As the leading part of the soul, the mind represents the soul. To have one soul is to be of the same mind. We may be in one spirit, but to be of the same soul is a further matter.</p>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 2 say, &ldquo;If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions, make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s thought was that if the Philippians desired to give him any encouragement and consolation, if they had any fellowship with him, and if they had a heart of tenderheartedness and compassions toward him, they should fulfill his joy by being like-minded. If those brothers and sisters had not been like-minded, Paul could not have been happy, and he would have had no encouragement and consolation.</p>
<p>In verse 2 Paul also speaks of having the same love. We may love others, but our love may be different for different persons. In this verse Paul once again mentions the soul, saying that the Philippians should be joined in soul. Then in 4:2 he says, &ldquo;I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF THE APOSTLES&rsquo; TEACHING BEING THE ECONOMY OF GOD FOR HIS BUILDING</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:3-4 says, &ldquo;Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith.&rdquo; The root of the word <em>economy</em> in Greek is <em>house.</em> God&rsquo;s economy is the building economics of God, the building arrangement, or stewardship, of God. It is God&rsquo;s stewardship for the purpose of building. The different teachings Paul speaks of minister questions rather than the building economics of God, which is in faith.</p>
<p>Verses 5 through 7 continue, &ldquo;But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith; from which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking, desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither the things that they say, nor concerning what they confidently affirm.&rdquo; To be a teacher of the Old Testament law is in contrast to being &ldquo;a good minister of Christ Jesus&rdquo; as mentioned in 4:6, one who is nourished, not merely taught, with the words of the faith and the good teaching. The teachers of the law teach people the law, but the ministers of Christ minister Christ to people. According to the above verses, in the first century, even in the days of the apostles, some Christians were teaching things that seemed very scriptural but were different from the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>The law and the genealogies of the Old Testament are both scriptural, but these teachings are different from that of the apostle Paul. The central thought of the teaching of the apostle Paul can be seen in his fourteen Epistles from Romans through Hebrews. The subject of all these Epistles, written by the same apostle, is simply the building economics of God with Christ as life as the center and content and with the church as the vessel, the building, the house, to contain and express this very Christ. This is the central thought of all the teaching of the apostle. However, in his time there were other teachers, teaching things that seemed to be scriptural but were very different from his teaching. Because the apostle encountered this problem, he asked Timothy to stay at Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently. Due to these different teachings, some misaimed and turned aside from Christ, the church, and the Body life to the so-called scriptural teachings of the law and the genealogies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEMS WITH<br />
THE ONENESS OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
BEING RELATED TO THE MIND, THE OPINION,<br />
AND DIFFERENT SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In this message I would like to emphasize three points: one mind, one opinion, and one speaking. The mind is the source, and from the mind we have a certain opinion. Then we speak whatever we have in our mind as an opinion. We should once again remember that man is a tripartite being, as illustrated by three concentric circles. We all have been regenerated in the spirit, represented by the innermost circle. Because of this, Christians have little problem being one in the spirit. We are all of the same spirit. Our problem, however, is with our mind and our speaking.</p>
<p>Christians use the two eyes of their body to read the Bible, and they exercise their mind to understand it. However, not many exercise their spirit when they read the Bible. We have the same problem concerning the oneness. Christians mainly use their mind to have too many opinions, and then they use their body to speak too much. Whenever our mind is not under the control of the spirit, we use our mouth too loosely. The problem among the Lord&rsquo;s children is not in their spirit. In our spirit we all have the oneness of the Spirit. The problem is with our mind and with our speaking.</p>
<p>Our speaking always causes the problems. First Corinthians 1:10 says, &ldquo;That you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&rdquo; Both in 1 Corinthians and in Philippians the apostle Paul deals with the divisive factors of the mind, the opinion, and speaking. If we all learn the lesson to bring our mind under the control of the spirit, we will see a difference. Much of our speaking will be swallowed up.</p>
<p>I have a very heavy burden in my spirit concerning these things. The more a businessman carries out his line of work, the more he considers it and learns from experience. In the same principle, we have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for more than thirty years, always considering our situation and studying the Word of God, history, and biographies. We have studied the Bible and history, compared them to our present situation, and examined the situation according to our experience. Because of this, we have a certain amount of learning and realization. The more we have learned, the more we are very concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s children. The practical building up of the church depends upon our oneness. If we have divisions rather than oneness, there can be no building. Instead, we will have only a tearing down.</p><h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF SPEAKING DIFFERENTLY<br />
ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF THE MIND</h2>
<p>About ten years ago in Taiwan a very spiritual brother with a high spiritual ministry came among us. We respected him very much, and we honored his ministry. Because we received much help from him, we arranged a meeting with him and about one hundred young co-workers, most of whom were under my training. While we were fellowshipping, he suddenly said, &ldquo;I am disappointed with the way you have your Lord&rsquo;s table.&rdquo; In his opinion we should have had one person to preside over the meeting. He said, &ldquo;You are too loose. Everyone behaves according to his or her feeling.&rdquo; I was surprised and dismayed by this speaking. I had invited him there to help the work. If he had seen something that was not fitting, the best and most proper way to deal with it would have been to speak privately about it.</p>
<p>Later I was invited to his place of meeting, and I stayed there for four weeks, attending the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings. He stood up to begin the meeting, and he announced the hymn, offered a prayer, read the Bible, and spoke a word. Then he offered a blessing for the bread, called for the deacons, and passed one plate to each of them. After the deacons took the plates to the attendants, everyone held the bread in their hand and waited. Finally he himself picked up a piece of the bread and said, &ldquo;Now let us eat.&rdquo; Then he offered another blessing for the cup in the same way, passed the trays of cups to the deacons, and again everyone waited until he took a cup and said, &ldquo;Now let us drink.&rdquo; After he offered another prayer, a time of &ldquo;public worship&rdquo; began in which certain others prayed. After about ten minutes he announced, &ldquo;Now the public worship is over.&rdquo; When this brother was among us, he told us that he was disappointed with our table meeting. If I would have spoken in the same way, I too would have said that I was very disappointed with his meeting. Nevertheless, we all practice the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in a certain way. In Taiwan the churches practice one way, and in other places others practice in a different way. We cannot say absolutely which is the right way.</p>
<p>We may also use baptism to illustrate the problem of oneness. We all practice baptism, but some baptize by immersion, some by sprinkling, and some even baptize by waving a flag over people. A brother from Manila once asked me what words we speak when we baptize people. He told me that one group insists on saying, &ldquo;I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; but another group insists on saying, &ldquo;I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; These two groups contended with each other over this issue. This illustrates that simply in this one matter alone there are many opinions. Some brothers among us baptize without saying much; they only say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; In other places the brothers baptize in the name of the Lord, in the name of Christ, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Some brothers like to speak more, so they say, &ldquo;Brother, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I baptize you in the name of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; All of these ways are good.</p>
<p>In addition to contending over the name into which we baptize, others consider what kind of water to use. Some insist on baptizing in the sea, and others in the river, yet others baptize in a swimming pool. Moreover, some argue about how many times to immerse people. Some immerse once, but others immerse three times, once each for the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>One brother strongly told me that we should not baptize in water at all. He said that water baptism is dispensationally over and that today we need only the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Shortly afterward in another place, a sister stood up in the middle of my message and said, &ldquo;Tell me, do you baptize people with water? Without water baptism no one can be saved.&rdquo; One says that water baptism is dispensationally over, but another says that without it no one can be saved. The issues affecting the oneness among the Lord&rsquo;s children seem endless.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ADJUSTING A CHURCH IN ANOTHER LOCALITY BUT GOING ALONG WITH THE CHURCH<br />
AND MINISTERING THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We need to learn the lessons from history. According to history, all the denominations arose because someone began to stress a particular teaching or practice. This is the reason why in almost every city today there are many different denominations. The practice of different churches, what is emphasized in them, and their outstanding features may even be according to the natural disposition of the leading ones there. If a local church has been raised up under a certain kind of practice, we should be wise and not speak differently against its practice. Some may ask, &ldquo;What then shall I do? It seems that I can do nothing there.&rdquo; This is not the case. There are many things we can do. We can go along with the church to preach the gospel and bring people to the Lord. We can help the saints to know the Lord more in life and in the spirit without referring to particular practices or bringing in our own practice. Then we also can pray and wait. At a certain time the Lord may open the way to speak about a certain practice. Still, we should not stress it, and we should always be watchful as to whether or not our speaking will cause trouble. If our speaking causes trouble, we must stay silent. Otherwise, we can try to minister something in a positive way.</p>
<p>In my ministry I often tell people that man is a trichotomy, a person of three parts. However, in a local church that meets on the proper ground, the brothers and sisters may have been raised up under a ministry that teaches dichotomy. If I go to such a church, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace I will not speak a word about trichotomy. I will simply go along with the church in a positive way. I will simply say, &ldquo;Brothers, we need to love the Lord. We have been regenerated in our spirit, so now we have to contact the Lord by exercising our spirit.&rdquo; Some may come to me and ask, &ldquo;What about the difference between the spirit and soul?&rdquo; However, due to the atmosphere in that church I would say only, &ldquo;Brothers, forget about this. As long as we love the Lord and honor Him, everything is all right.&rdquo; I can still do many things to help the church there. If I have the measure and the stature, I can minister the riches of Christ to the saints without mentioning trichotomy and, even the more, without opposing dichotomy.</p>
<p>As long as the saints in a certain place are one in the Lord&rsquo;s life and in the church as His expression, they are the church on the proper ground. We must recognize this fact, and we must respect their situation. If we go to them openly or even privately to tell them that dichotomy is incorrect and to show them trichotomy in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we are wrong. We may be right doctrinally, but we are wrong practically, and we will damage the church. We must not do this.</p>
<p>I have been in the United States for more than three years, and I have visited many places. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I did not correct, adjust, make proposals, or speak differently from them. Even when some have asked me to speak about a certain matter, I simply ministered something of Christ positively to help the church to go on. This does not mean that I agree with all the practices in every place. If a certain church were under my hand, its practice might be completely different. If the &ldquo;car&rdquo; were in my hand, I would drive it in a different way. However, it is not my car, so I should not be a backseat driver.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO LEARN THE LESSON<br />
NOT TO ADJUST OTHERS<br />
BUT TO HELP THEM IN A POSITIVE WAY</h2>
<p>I first learned this lesson when I stayed with Brother Watchman Nee. I watched and observed how he conducted himself. He never made differing proposals to a local church, and he never adjusted or corrected them. He once told me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, what good is it to adjust others? On the whole earth we cannot find one group of Christians that was ever successfully adjusted. It is impossible to adjust others, and it is foolish to try.&rdquo; Consider yourself as an example. Are you willing to be adjusted?</p>
<p>If someone is driving a car, he does not want someone else to be a backseat driver. To say nothing about someone else&rsquo;s driving means that we have learned the proper lesson. Someone who is patient about everything else may be unable to be patient with a backseat driver. That is why Watchman Nee told me that it is foolish to adjust others. Not one person on this earth wants to be adjusted. He said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, be patient. The wisest thing is to let people go. Then they will learn the lesson, and later they will come back to ask you for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was a learner under Brother Nee&rsquo;s hand at that time, but many times when I saw the things happening around us, I was unable to be patient. I asked him, &ldquo;Do you agree with this? Why don&rsquo;t you speak a word about it? If you say something, people will receive it.&rdquo; Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;You are wrong. Even if the Lord Jesus came to speak a word, they would not receive it. You should not try to be higher than the Lord Jesus. Let them go their way. One day they will learn the lesson.&rdquo; I have come to realize that this is the truth. We cannot help others by adjusting them; we can only create problems in this way. If we adjust people, we will never see a profit. We will see only a loss to others and to ourselves.</p>
<p>If we go to a certain place to minister, we should always remember to avoid adjusting people. Then our ministry will be preserved, and we will not be involved in problems. We will keep a position to minister something positive, and our ministry will not be damaged. People will not be troubled by us. Instead, what they receive from us will be something positive as a gain and a profit. However, if we do adjust people, sooner or later we will damage them and our ministry. The doors for our ministry will be closed, and we will lose our position to minister. The more we try to adjust people, the more we lose our credit with them, and they will have no confidence in us. If we avoid adjusting others and always help them positively, we will build up a strong confidence among them. This will help them and us also.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RESPECTING THE SITUATION IN A LOCAL CHURCH AND SEEKING AN OPENING TO MINISTER TO THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Wherever we go, we need to recognize the facts of history, respect the present situation in that place, and go along with the church in a positive way. Then perhaps an opening will be prepared for us to minister something further. Still, we need to be very wise and careful, always on the alert not to create trouble. The Scriptures show us the principle that the building of the house of God requires peace. David was unable to carry out the building of the temple because in his time there was no peace. When there is no peace and harmony, it is impossible to build up the house of God. We should not try to say who is right and who is wrong about an issue. As long as we create trouble, we may be right in doctrine, but we are wrong in our way.</p>
<p>As we have said, if we go to a place where dichotomy is taught, we should not speak against it, and we should not insist on trichotomy. However, if certain ones who teach dichotomy come to our locality, they also should recognize the facts and respect the present situation among us. In the past three years the Lord has raised up a church here through the ministry. This ministry cannot avoid speaking about trichotomy, because we have learned and experienced this fact, and it is through this ministry that the church here has been built up.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who come to us should recognize the situation with the church and the ministry, whether or not they agree with trichotomy. They should not speak against trichotomy, but they should go along with the church here in a positive way. There will still be many opportunities to help the church by ministering. They can help the church to preach the gospel, for example. There will always be openings for a positive ministering. There are forty-five minutes for speaking after the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day. If someone has an abundance of life in Christ, and he is very much in the spirit, he may take five minutes to stand and speak a word to minister life to others. There is no need to say trichotomy is wrong and dichotomy is right. He may simply minister something of the love of Christ, our love toward Christ, and the way to fellowship with the Lord and touch Him. In this way he will enrich the meeting without raising up any problems. He will be a witness of light and life.</p>
<p>If someone has learned something of Christ in his spirit and has a real surplus of Christ, he can offer a prayer in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. In only a few minutes the whole congregation can be helped. Once when Brother Nee attended the Keswick Convention, he was asked to offer a prayer. That prayer uplifted the entire congregation to the extent that no one paid attention to the message afterward. After the meeting everyone talked about that prayer. This illustrates that even one prayer can help people very much. If we have a portion of Christ, there is no need to try to change the way of a church in a certain place. We can still minister what we have gained of Christ. Even if there is no opening for ministering in the meeting, we can still visit the brothers in their homes, not to speak something different from the teaching in that place but to minister life to everyone in every family. In this way we will edify, build up, and enrich the church.</p></body></html>
