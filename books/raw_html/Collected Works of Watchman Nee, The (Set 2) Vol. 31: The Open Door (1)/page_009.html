<h2 class="head2">News from Yen-Ping and Nan-Ya, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>It took me only two and a half hours to travel by bus from Jien-Ou down to Yen-Ping on the fifth of this month. Je-dun has come early to lead the meetings. I helped a little with the women attendees. Except for X, everyone was receptive. I saw how they longed for the truth and how they honored people like us. Nevertheless, I have told the Lord that I cannot do anything. The only thing that I can do is to offer myself into the Lord's hand for His breaking so that others might be fed. I thank the Lord for showing me that the work is the Lord's. When it is effectual, one should not be thrilled; and when it is not effectual, one should not be disheartened. One should just forge ahead according to the Lord's charge. Thank the Lord for leading me to live this sojourning life. May the Lord truly make me a wanderer to sojourn in this land with Him.</p><p>There is a certain missionary in Yen-Ping whose life is quite excellent and who is also desirous of the truth. She has a heart for the Lord, but she has been deaf for the past four years. I recall that Sister Hsiao Yu-yin was healed through a book written in English. Perhaps Brother David Hsu borrowed that book from someone. Please secure this book for me. Whether or not you can get the book, pray for this Western missionary sister. May the Lord be merciful to her and grant her grace to glorify His name. On the thirteenth of this month, I left Yen-Ping and took a one-and-a-half-hour bus ride north to Nan-Ya Village. This is the first place on the upper course of the river where the X denomination began its work. Most of the members of the denomination are spiritually dead. I have invited the women of the church to come together in the afternoon, and I have preached to them. Hopefully, some will understand salvation. May the Lord be gracious to us. After this, I will go to a village forty miles from here; from there I will return to Jien-Ou. I have entrusted my children to the Lord and am at peace and undisturbed in serving the Lord. Thank the Lord, my son Jia-en was sick, but he was healed the next day. Thank the Lord! I have received recent news concerning many brothers and sisters. May the Lord be gracious to you and may He empower you to serve Him. Peace be to you. Please greet Sister Chang for me.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yu-bing, November 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chen Ke-san, Fukien Province</h2><p>My Brother X:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord. While I was in Pu-Tien, I received your letter. Thank the Lord for His grace. Since I was coming to Yu-Shi, I did not reply to your letter right away. May the Lord bless and remember you. May the Lord use Hankow as the Antioch of the inland regions. We look to the Lord to show us our future. The passport I had during the last three months is only good for traveling to Chuanchow, Sien-You, Fu-Ching, and Pu-Tien. Please continue to send The Open Door to Pu-Tien. Brother Tsai-seng went to Sien-You this time. I believe that he has already started the Lord's table meeting there. There are now over ten brothers and sisters who are ready to serve the Lord. Brother Shao-hwa has moved from Foochow to Sien-You to take up a teaching post. God's arrangement is always wonderful. Thank and praise Him. May the Lord use him in Sien-You. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Chen Ke-san<br />November 29<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Call of Lung-Yen, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear sister in the Lord:</p><p>The region around Lung-Yen is at peace, and the work can still go on. However, I have felt quite lonely, and I am too weak to pioneer new regions. The meeting here needs much strengthening from men whom the Lord can use. (No one has been here before except Brother Nee, Brother Stephen Kaung, and Brother Chai Tze-chung, who were here last year. It is about two hundred miles inland from Amoy.) The need among the sisters is especially urgent. Most of the sisters in the meetings are uneducated, and there are very few sisters who can render the ladies any help. Please remember this work in your prayer. Greetings to you in the Lord.</p><p>Deng Tze-cheng<br />November 30<br />[Address omitted]</p>
