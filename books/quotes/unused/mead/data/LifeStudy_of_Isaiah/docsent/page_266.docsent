   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Assigned a Grave with the Wicked,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but with a Rich Man in His Death</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Isaiah 53:9, Christ was assigned a grave with the wicked, but with a rich man in His death, although He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who crucified Him planned to bury Him with the two transgressors, the wicked ones; but eventually God in His sovereignty caused Christ to be buried in a rich man's tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Christ died, a rich man, Joseph of Arimathea, came to claim His body, and he put the body into a new tomb Matt 27:57-60 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth, yet people treated Him in a mean way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But God in His sovereignty came in to carry out His justice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Christ died, God's judgment had been completed, so God immediately took Him away from any kind of suffering and put Him in a rich man's tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. Jehovah Having Caused</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>the Iniquity of Us All to Fall on Him</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the aforementioned things were done by man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was man who oppressed Christ, afflicted Him, judged Him, led Him to the slaughter, put Him on the cross, and crucified Him between two transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After man had done all these things, Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all, who have gone astray like sheep and have turned to our own way, to fall on Him Isa 53:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Isaiah 53:6, the phrase us all refers to the remnant of the Jews at the time of the Lord Jesus' coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time all the remaining Jews will repent and will speak the words of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all to fall upon the man who was oppressed, judged, afflicted, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By reading the four Gospels carefully, we can see that Christ hung on the cross for six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon Mark 15:25, 33-37; Matt 27:45-50; Luke 23:44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the first three hours, from nine o'clock until noon, all that Christ suffered was inflicted by man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, at noon God came in to cause all the iniquities of His chosen people to fall upon that dying One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Immediately the sky became dark.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was a sign of God's dealing with His chosen people's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Christ shouted, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It must be a fact that at that juncture God forsook Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God had been with Christ continuously until that time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 16:32 the Lord said, "I am not alone, because the Father is with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But at noon on the day of His crucifixion, God caused all the iniquity of His chosen people to fall upon Christ, taking Him as our Substitute, legally, according to God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God removed all the iniquities from us and put them on Christ, making Christ the unique sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then God forsook Him because at that time He was our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, Christ died a vicarious death, a death that was recognized and approved by God's law.</S>
