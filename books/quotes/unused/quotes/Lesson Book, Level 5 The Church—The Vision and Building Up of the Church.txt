Our experiences of life and growth in life are not for our own spirituality, but for the building up of the church
Having seen this vision, we will never leave the church due to distractions in the world or 'problems in the church
It is good to read the outline first to get an overview of the lesson before you proceed to the text of the lesson
We sometimes replaced New Testament quotations found inside the brackets with the corresponding Recovery Version verse
You must also learn how all the key verses relate to one another in presenting the vision of the church and the way to build up the church
Twenty-four days, each with three hours, will provide adequate time to pray, to cover all the lessons, and to fellowship
What God is what God has what He has passed through what He has accomplished and what He has obtained and attained are all for the church
Ephesians 3:10-11 unveils the fact that the existence of the church is according to the eternal purpose of God which He purposed in Christ
God planned to have a corporate Body, a corporate vessel, with which he could mingle Himself and all that He is
After being regenerated in their spirit they are suitable for the building, but their soul still needs sanctification and transformation
The sanctifying and transforming work is done by the Triune God to produce material for the building of His church
Because the church is a living organism ruled by life, there is no need of a hierarchy to organize or rule over the church
They are not organizational leaders, but ones who are more mature in life to shepherd the younger, the newer, and the weaker ones in life
From there man sinned, developed the world, lived in the flesh, loved only himself, and became separated from one another
Those problems are not part of the church, they are the blemishes and wrinkles the Lord is cleansing in this age
Nearly all of the things revealed about God's eternal plan for the church are found in the two books of Ephesians and Colossians
The book to the Ephesians is the revelation of the Body, and the book to the Colossians is the revelation of the Head
When put together, these two books reveal a universal man, composed of Christ the Head, and the church the Body!
God has something to dispense, so He needs an arrangement and an administration in order to carry out this dispensing
In a similar way, God Himself is a corporation with an economy, and in this economy God's divine business is the church
Their thought is that the church is a group of fallen people who are saved and who come together to worship God
In God's dispensation, in God's administration, in God's arrangement, in God's governmental stewardship, He has eternally planned the church
According to the Bible, the birthright includes the double portion of the land, the kingship, and the priesthood
We thank Him for all our situations, because through prayer we can rejoice always in our spirit to grow in life
God not only created man in His image to express Himself, He also committed His full authority to man for the purpose of subduing His enemy
The church is built up by the sonship, and through the building up of the church, the enemy is subdued and God's wisdom is displayed
It is God's eternal purpose that in the economy of the fullness of times He might head up all things in Christ
The old serpent will be cast into the lake of fire; and even death, the last enemy to be dealt with by God, will be cast away
The shining of the New Jerusalem is the glory of the manifestation of the sons of God, and all the nations will be brought into that light
It is by being life to the church, and the church being built up by this life, that the light of God shines out as the controlling factor
All of God's problems will be solved, and all creation will be brought into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God
We all have to admit that since the time of the apostles until at least the sixteenth century the church was going downward
By reading church history, you could realize that before Zinzendorf, no one was so clear concerning the church practice
Their practice was a great improvement over that which was practiced under the leadership of Zinzendorf at Bohemia
They began to drop the English term church, because they realized that it had been damaged through wrong usage
At that time fallen Christianity considered the church to be a physical building, perhaps with a 'high tower'' and a bell
Even today many parents say to their children on Sunday morning Let us go to church referring to the wood the stone the brick and the glass
Since fallen man is in the world and has even become the world, how can God fulfill His purpose with man and through man?
Because the church as the assembly is separated from the world, we may say that the church is composed of the real Hebrews
Just as our forefather Abraham was called out of the land of Chaldea, so we have been called out of the world by God to be His assembly
There must be a great and thorough separation between the church as the ekklesia and the world as the system, the cosmos, of Satan
As the assembly, the church is separated entirely for God so that He may have a means to carry out His eternal purpose
Three verses which reveal that the church is the house of God are 1 Timothy 3:15; Hebrews 3:6; and 1 Peter 4:17
In Old Testament times, the house of God was the house of Israel , symbolized by the tabernacle or the temple among them
In our meetings service and ministry we should give people the impression that the living God is living moving speaking and acting among us
Paul is saying that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God
If you look at a person's house, you will be able to tell what kind of person he is, because a person's house is his expression
God not only desires to make home in the church and to have a resting place there; He also wants to express Himself in the church
All that He is, all that He is doing, and all that He wants to obtain are to be manifested, expressed, in the church as His dwelling place
Although the church today is God's kingdom, we are in the kingdom in reality only when we live and walk in spirit
Whenever we behave according to the old man or live in the flesh or the self, we, in a practical way, are out of God's kingdom
When we are in the flesh, we are in the old realm of the fallen human nature, which has been fully usurped by Satan to form his kingdom
The church as the house of God is a corporate person because this house is the family of God, the household of God
Whether we are living in the church as the house of God or as the kingdom of God depends on whether we are living as members or as citizens
In 14:17 Paul does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is
According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today's church life
In a sense, it is correct to say that the present age is the church age and that the coming age will be the kingdom age
In another sense, the kingdom of God is here today, for the kingdom is the reality of the church and the living of the church
Since the church is the kingdom today, it is not correct to say that the kingdom has been suspended altogether until the coming age
In Romans 14:17 we see that the kingdom of God as the living of the church is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
When the authority of God's kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life
When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy with God
Whenever we live righteously toward ourselves and peacefully toward others, we shall live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit
For this reason, at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, they will have no participation in the kingdom
Those who grow and develop in the divine life to the full extent will be supplied with a rich and bountiful entry into the coming kingdom
We all need to grow in the divine life in the church life so that in the coming age we may have a rich entrance into the kingdom of God
Just as in ones physical body the head and the body are one so Christ the Head and the church His Body are joined and therefore are one
All that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the Head is not only for the Body but also to the Body
You and your newly saved ones, may prophesy and testify to exhibit Christ in the church meetings to build up the Body of Christ
The most enjoyable and fulfilling way to live our human life and our Christian life is to live as a member of the Body of Christ
The church is not only the Body of Christ, but also the fullness, the expression, which issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ
It is the house or household of God , it is the Body of Christ , and it is the fullness as the expression of Christ and of God
While we are enjoying Him in such a way, we are being filled with all the riches of Christ, resulting in an expression of God
The church today should be such an expression, issuing out of the rich enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ
He went through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be the life-giving Spirit
In the whole universe the church stands out as an expression of God's wisdom; its design cannot be improved upon
If we remain in the old way of life, we cannot be renewed and we have little participation in the new man church life
In the creation of the one new man, however, God's nature has been wrought into man to make His nature one entity with humanity
In the old creation God did not create millions of men; on the contrary, He created one man Adam, who includes all men
God's life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature
Although the old creation came into being through the work of the mighty God, He Himself does not reside in it
We can receive the divine life and the divine nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit
Corinthians 5:17 says, 'If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new'
The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ's resurrection
The believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation
In the old creation man was created to have God's image to express Him and also to have His dominion to represent Him
Gods positive intention is that man would express Him whereas Gods negative intention is that man would deal with Gods enemy Satan the Devil
Because of the working of Satan, who is the authority of darkness, the earth and its atmosphere have become 'this darkness'
As Eve was Adam's increase, so the church as the bride, the wife, of Christ as the Bridegroom, the Husband, is Christ's increase
In Revelation 19:7 and 8 we see that Christ and His counterpart, His bride, will be married at His coming back
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Lamb who came to take away sin and also the Bridegroom who came that He might have the bride
The consummation of the church as the counterpart of Christ will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity
The Bible begins with the marriage of Adam and Eve in Genesis and ends with the marriage of the Spirit and the bride in Revelation
For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory
The transformed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction
In this lesson we shall consider the final aspect of the status of the church-the church as the golden lampstands
With the lampstand as a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God there are three important things the gold the stand and the lamps
Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made the stand is the embodiment of the gold and the lamps are the expression of the stand
If we consider this substance, this element of the lampstand, we shall see that it signifies the divine nature
Substantially the lampstand is one, but expressively it is seven, because it is one lampstand with seven lamps
We can prove from the Scriptures that the seven lamps of the golden lampstand signify the Spirit expressing Christ
As we proceed from Exodus to Zechariah, we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ, the seven eyes of Jehovah
As we continue to Revelation, we see that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes which are the intensified Spirit of God
In the coming millennium, the restored nation of Israel will once again be God's testimony symbolized by a golden lampstand
In Exodus 25 we only have the lampstand with the seven lamps; there is no mention of what the seven lamps refer to
The seven eyes, the seven Spirits, of Jehovah are the seven eyes of Christ, who is the Stone-Savior for God's building
The Lord Jesus as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God's people
In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and in 5:6 the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God
We have a further development over Zechariah for the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the stone but also the seven eyes of the Lamb
All the local churches as the many lampstands are the reproduction of Christ and the Spirit as the one lampstand
Eventually, in Revelation both the stand and the lamps, that is, both Christ and the Spirit, are reproduced as the local churches
The fact that the church is a golden lampstand indicates that we should not bring anything other than God into the church life
Even good things such as ethics, culture, education, and proper religion are dross, because they are not God Himself
Although the church is composed of humanity with divinity, humanity should not be the basic nature of the local churches
To say that the church is the embodiment of the Triune God is not to make the church a part of deity or an object of worship
Now we may enjoy this life and nature day by day and learn to live not by our natural life but by the divine life and nature
As we live this way and are transformed, there will be the fullness, the expression, the form, the appearance of Christ
On top of this mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates
Most Christians do not see the two aspects of the church, and therefore have made many mistakes concerning this matter for centuries
There is no Anglican Church, no Chinese Church, no Korean Church, no Presbyterian Church, no Baptist Church, and no Pentecostal Church
Out of all the different ways of practicing the church life among Christians today, it is difficult to find one that is right
The Old Testament saints, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Moses, David, and Isaiah, were not members of the New Testament church
The Son revealed by the Father is now building the universal church, not the church in a nation or the church in a city
The universal church is to be built on the rock of the revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the living God
Others may see something concerning the universal aspect of the church yet they do not regard the local aspect of the church to be important
The proper answer is that, locally speaking, we are in many churches, but, universally speaking, we are all in one church
Since we are now in the city of Seoul, we should say that we are in the universal church by being in the church in Seoul
The best answer is that you are a member of the universal church which Jesus Christ is building, by being a member of a proper local church
The ground of locality is a protection which ensures that a church in a particular locality will always be preserved in oneness
Locally, the ground of the church is the ground of locality; universally, the ground of the church is the genuine oneness
Suppose all the local churches in Korea are one with each other, but are not one with the churches in other continents
All the local churches in the six continentsin North America in South America in Europe in Africa in Australia and in Asiaare one Body
The church is one locally based upon its locality, the city, and it is one universally based upon the one Body of Christ
The highest is the central government, and under the central government are the provincial, or state, governments and the city governments
Even the administration of the smallest local church in Korea is equal with the administration of the church in Seoul
Although the administration of the church is separate and equal locally, the fellowship of the church is one universally
In these nations there are separate churches in many cities, but there is only one fellowship in the entire universe
In all the churches we should only teach one thing-Jesus Christ as the Spirit to be our life for the producing of the church
We accept only one kind of teaching, the teaching of the apostles, and have only one fellowship, the apostles' fellowship
We must refer to the Bible to see who is qualified to form the church, and to see how the local churches are established
No one in heaven or on earth throughout the history of mankind could save God's people out of this dilemma except Jesus Christ our Lord
As a result of His crucifixion, not only were all the negative things terminated on the cross, but the divine life was released
We need another life-the life of God to regenerate our spirit so that we may be sons of God and living members of the church
Corinthians 15:45b tells us that in His resurrection and through His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
The disciples were 'startled and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit'' , that is, a phantom, a ghost, a specter
After showing the disciples 'both His hands and His side'' , the Lord 'breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit''
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
In John 1 Christ is the Lamb, but in John 20, after His death and in His resurrection, He is the pneumatic Christ
The Lord became the pneumatic Christ through resurrection, and today, in resurrection, He still comes to us as the Spirit, the pneuma
After the Lord Jesus came in John 20:19, there is no word or hint in John's record indicating that the Lord left the disciples
To the surprise of the disciples, at various times and in different places He would appear, manifesting Himself to them
Ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, He, having again received the consummated Spirit, poured out this Spirit upon all His disciples
On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed the Spirit into the disciples essentially as life for their spiritual existence
The Lord Jesus Himself is the pattern for the believers' receiving the Spirit both essentially and economically
On the day of the Lord's resurrection, the essential Spirit for the disciples' spiritual existence and being was breathed into them
The second step was the Lord's pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon the believers, baptizing them into one Body
By these two steps the believers were filled inwardly with the Spirit and were clothed outwardly with the Spirit
Inwardly they had the Spirit of essence, the essential Spirit, and outwardly they had the Spirit of economy, the economical Spirit
As a result they were altogether wrapped up with the Spirit and by being wrapped up with the Spirit they were formed into the Body of Christ
The church was formed through Christ's baptizing all the believers, both Jews and Gentiles, in one Spirit into one Body
Ephesians 1:22 and 23 tell us that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body
The important phrase 'to the church'' implies that whatever Christ the Head has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church
The outpouring of the Spirit differs from the breathing of the Spirit into the disciples out of the mouth of Christ at His resurrection
The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit is actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself
By these two steps the Head of the Body baptized all His believers once for all, both Jewish and Gentile, into His one Body
Do you think that anyone can form a church because he wants to or because he does not like the church he is in?
He did the choosing, the redeeming, and the regenerating through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
The apostles, in Acts, began to establish the local churches and we are continuing this process until the Lord's return
Assuming to do such a thing would be abominable in the sight of God, for it is presuming to do something that only God Himself can do
If we all have the desire to establish churches by planting church trees, the establishing of the churches will be very fast and prevailing
The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder
The designation believers denotes those who have believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God's New Testament economy
The believers are also those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God
When the establishment of the local churches started with the one hundred twenty in Jerusalem, only typical Jews were involved
According to the record in Acts 13:1, the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were from a number of different sources
At the very beginning of this turn the pattern was established to indicate that the churches are composed of all races and classes of people
In Antioch, the Holy Spirit set Barnabas and Paul apart to be sent out to establish more churches among the Gentiles
The Greek words rendered 'in every church'' contain the preposition kata with the distributive usage-according to church
All the churches in which the elders were appointed respectively by the apostles in Acts 14:23 were established within less than one year
They were not voted in by their congregation; they were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity in Christ
In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should be absolutely the work of the Holy Spirit
Thessalonica, like Philippi, was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia
Thessalonians 1:1 says, 'Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ'
Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians were addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city
Achaia was south of Macedonia and was a province of the Roman Empire, a great part of today's Greece, in which is the city of Corinth
It indicates that the church in Corinth was not the church of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, nor of any practice or doctrine, but of God
There were not two churches in Rome, one called the church in Rome and another which met in the house of Aquila and Prisca
On the one hand, this couple was for all the churches; on the other hand, they were for their local church in particular
Before Paul and Barnabas were sent out from the church in Antioch, they were teachers and prophets in that locality, being local
When they were set apart and sent out by the Holy Spirit, they became apostles, the sent ones for the universal church
They are still under the leading and guiding of the apostles who raised them up and appointed them to their office
A factious man is a sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions
It is not that we separate ourselves from other believers; it is that the sects and denominations separate us from the church life
If we are to share in the recovery of the church, we need to be separated from all the sects and denominations
Like Ezra, Nehemiah, and other faithful ones in the Old Testament, we need to leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem
In turn, these also reject Christ's redemption, insisting that His death was a martyrdom rather than for our redemption
If He did not resurrect then we have no proof of our justification and He would not be the lifegiving Spirit to regenerate and transform us
Just as Christ is far above all and sits in the heavenlies , so also the church sits together with Him in the heavenlies
Just as Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth , so also the church participates in His authority
Today the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, and in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory
The two Christ and the church are thus mingled and joined as one with Christ being the inward content and the church the outward expression
Verse 12 says, 'For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
The many gifted persons in verse 11 have only one ministry, that of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church
According to the grammatical construction of verse 12, 'the building up of the Body of Christ'' is 'the work of ministry'
Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ
The four special gifts in verse 11the apostles the prophets the evangelists and the shepherdteachersdo not build the Body of Christ directly
When the authority of God's kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life
To have such a living is to establish the kingdom life as typified in the book of Nehemiah by the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem
Although there were and still are many failures in the churches as well as the degradation of the church, the Lord is always recovering
'The things which remain'' are the things lost and restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith and the open Bible
Speaking of those who have not defiled their garments, the Lord says, 'They shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy'
White garments here signify the walk and living which are unspotted by death and which will be approved by the Lord
If we are overcomers, when the Lord comes in the kingdom we shall have the special privilege of eating with Him
The living overcomers, comprised only of the New Testament overcomers, will be the firstfruit of God's harvest on the earth
They will be raptured to Mount Zion in the heavens for God and Christ's satisfaction before the great tribulation
All the overcomers, both the dead and the living, will be the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium
The overcomers will also be the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against the Antichrist and his armies
The problem with the evil slave is not that he does not know that the Lord is coming but that he does not expect Him
The Lord will not cut the evil slave in pieces; rather, He will cast him off from the glory in which He Himself will be
Whenever a person believes in the Lord, he is put into an organic union with the Triune God so that he may enjoy Him
The overcomers will be called into the Lord's enjoyment, which will be in the glory, but the defeated ones will be put outside this glory
Both the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be a sign of suffering the Lord's dispensational and governmental discipline
The Lord's dispensational and governmental discipline is also illustrated by the case of the slothful slave in Matthew 25:24-30
In verses 26 through 30 we see that the one-talented one who was not faithful in using his gift is rebuked by the Lord and punished
Verse 30 says, 'Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'
Its consummation will be also in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God for eternity
He destroyed the devil and left our flesh of sin on the cross so that we may be free from the law of sin and of death
He released His life on the cross, and as the life-giving Spirit, through resurrection, He brought the life of God into us
He also brought us into the church to be with all the saints that we may go on together and be built-up together to fulfill God's purpose
In the next twelve lessons, we will see the building up of the church and our participation in her building up
We not only want to show you a heavenly vision of the church, we also want you to know how this vision can be accomplished
On the one hand, this rock signifies Christ; on the other hand, it signifies the revelation seen by the apostles
The Bible shows us that, on the one hand, the Body of Christ is built upon Christ Himself, with Him as the foundation
The foundation of the apostles and the prophets is the revelation they have seen which is the whole New Testament from Matthew to Revelation
Although there are several types in the Old Testament typifying the church, the word 'church'' is not found in the Old Testament
The Lord Jesus continued what John had preached, and as a result, Peter, James, John, and many others received it
Of these the Lord appointed twelve as apostles and sent them out to preach the gospel but none of them knew that all this was for the church
For the purpose of stirring up churches everywhere, until the whole world is so stirred up that it is filled with churches!
The Lord said that the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth and then the end shall come
It cannot prevail against the church, for the church is the Body of Christ, the Head, who sits on the throne in heaven
He has also received authority from God the Father and has been made Lord and Christ and the Ruler of the kings of the earth
The book of Genesis in the Old Testament records the story of Jacob when he dreamed of a heavenly ladder in the wilderness
When you call O Lord Jesus immediately the ascended Christ will be transmitted into you like electricity and you will be strengthened within
Ephesians 4:8 says, 'Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men'
We may appreciate the Lord's coming down from the heavens, but we also need an uplifted appreciation of His ascension
He became a gift who could expound the Old Testament, who could preach the gospel, teach the saints, and prophesy
He wrote this portion in describing Christ's death and resurrection to accomplish His full redemption and impart life to us
His descension was the means to accomplish His allinclusive full redemption which has saved us from sin death Satan and the lake of fire
The Amplified New Testament renders 'He led a train of vanquished foes'' for 'He led captive those taken captive'
Through His descension and ascension, Christ rescued us, enlivened us, and made us gifts with His resurrection life
That means he became a big gift to the church in the category of the gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11
We may speak in this way to our unbelieving contacts: 'I would like to tell you that our Savior descended in two steps
In the second step of His descension, He entered into death and even went into Hades, dying for us to save us from sin, death, and Satan
As sinners, we were captives of Satan, but through the death of Christ we were forgiven and even rescued from Satan
In the second step of His ascension, He led us as a train of vanquished foes to the third heaven to give us as a present to His Father'
During the time of the Roman Empire, when a general gained a victory, all his captives became a procession in the celebration of his victory
The meaning of perfecting can be illustrated by university students being taught by professors of different subjects
After four years of studying, they graduate and are able to do the same things that the professors do; they have all been perfected
It only trains some preachers to gather a congregation on Sunday for a service where one speaks and the rest listen
We stand on the ground of oneness in the different localities to worship God together and to build up the Body of Christ together
It cheers and warms up the gospel atmosphere for the saints that they would become burning to preach the gospel
While they speak, the listeners' hearts, mouths, and spirits will all be open and they will receive the Lord to be saved
They are like the mother who cannot nurse her child; thus the new ones do not receive much supply and teaching
The Lord desires all the saints to be perfected , but the Bible shows us that the Lord is calling for overcomers
In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord is sounding the trumpet for overcomers
According to Revelation 17:14 the army of overcomers that follow the Lamb are 'called and chosen and faithful'
The choosing of the Father in eternity past was for salvation, but the choosing in Revelation 17 at the end of this age is for overcoming
Thank God that we have been chosen by Him in eternity for salvation, but now we are under the test to be approved
These ready-to-fight chosen overcomers will be the bride in Revelation 19 to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb
Everyone who is contented with the present situation of the church life is not ready to be perfected, to go on with the Lord
During this period of time, we may have heard many messages, yet our situation is not up to a level with which we can be satisfied
What a privilege, what a mercy, and what an all-sufficient grace that we are now in the one organism of the Triune God!
We have to be perfected so that the entire Body of Christ functions in the same way that the gifted members do
In a local church, some can do the apostles' work to preach the gospel, teach the truth, establish churches, and appoint elders
God's intention is to perfect every saint to do what the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do
Some will be perfected to do the prophets' work to speak God, speak for God, and speak forth God, ministering Christ to all the people
The saints in a local church must be perfected to do the same work that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do
The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of the law, whereas the New Testament ministry is the ministry of the faith
As the law is the center and reality of the Old Testament, so the faith is the center and reality of the New Testament
The New Testament begins with the incarnation of Christ and continues with His death, resurrection, and second coming
His death and resurrection with His second coming issue in the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate consummation of the church
When we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of this all-inclusive person, we will not care for minor things
In Romans 14 Paul was very general in his attitude toward doctrinal matters that did not concern the faith or Christ's all-inclusive person
Some Christians receive other believers on the basis of what they believe concerning the Lord's second coming and the rapture
We have to learn the aspects of Christ's person in His death on the cross and the things that He terminated and took away on the cross
We have to know Christ as the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, the complete God and the perfect, tripartite man
His chosen and redeemed ones are regenerated, they are being transformed, and eventually they will be glorified
The way He builds the church is to recapture many men from Satan's usurpation by the power of His crucifixion and resurrection
He has only one Body; therefore, everyone who is related to the building up of the one Body of Christ must be in oneness
Different people with different purposes and opinions may try to unite themselves in organizations like the United Nations or labor unions
As with one husband there is one wife, so also, there is only one church as the full expression of the one God
The divine life within us is continually increasing, and that we are growing in this increasing of the divine life
The more we grow in the increasing of the divine life, the more we are perfected and the more oneness we live out
We may be accustomed to calling the prayer in Matthew 6 the Lord's prayer, but the prayer in John 17 is also the Lord's prayer
Although the believers in Christ come from many different countries and cultures, they all have the same unique divine life
They were afraid of the Jews and the soldiers who sought to seize Jesus and therefore ran away when Christ was captured
Later, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius , the Spirit was poured out upon them to form the one Body of Christ
The oneness of the Body was accomplished by the Triune God and we began to experience this oneness when we believed and were baptized
As we have pointed out in earlier lessons, the Lord sent the apostles out to raise up churches by their gospel, teaching, and fellowship
They continued in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles that they might grow in the Lord and be perfected to build up the church
They have the authority to resolve problems in the church, as was the case in the church in Corinth and the churches in Galatia
Some may have a different opinion concerning the apostles' relationship with the churches that they have established
Some have said that once the apostles establish churches and appoint elders, they should keep their hands off the churches
According to the Bible, after the apostles established churches and appointed elders in them, they still took care of the churches
While Paul was on his way to Jerusalem, he sent some from Miletus to call the elders in Ephesus to come to him
He told them that some would rise up from among them, speaking perverted things to draw away disciples after themselves
Each local church may have different practical needs locally, but its main need is to be filled up with the one Triune God
The spiritual and financial surplus as well as the needs of a local church should not be restricted to one particular locality
Denominational, interdenominational, and non-denominational churches are not built on the genuine ground of oneness
The elders are the more mature brothers in each locality appointed by the apostles to shepherd and perfect the church
Elders do not have authority of themselves, but they are the deputy authority of the Lord to care for the churches
By submitting to the authority of the elders, all the saints will be shepherded into life and be perfected to build up the church
In this lesson we will address two of the most crucial matters concerning building up the church-increase and spread
The branches of the Vine bear fruit by imparting the life of the Vine to others and making them a part of the Vine
Christianity today depends upon the giant preachers with huge gospel campaigns, but this is not so in the Bible
In the Bible, especially in the gospel of John, the real gospel preaching is the fruit-bearing of every member
The normal daily life of the members of the church is simply to bear fruit; then there is the increase of the church
The normal way is not to use our human effort; nor is it to depend upon a revival campaign with a giant preacher
Fruit-bearing is the outflow of life; so we must grow in life and also take the responsibility of fruit-bearing
It is regrettable that the proper people, the Christians, have nearly given up the God-ordained way to spread the gospel
Our past practice may have been good, but it is not nearly as effective as our present practice of going out to visit people
We have been sent to visit people by the ascended Christ, and while we are talking to people we are linked to Christ
Because we have been entrusted with the authority of the ascended Christ to preach the gospel, we should not ask people questions
The most effective way to preach the gospel is not to ask questions but to direct people to repent, pray, and be baptized
Baptism changes people because we are baptizing them into the name of the Triune God, which is the sum total of the divine Being
When a local church spreads to other cities to have more local churches, we call it the spreading of the churches
The spreading of God's kingdom really does not only depend on the apostles, but also on the believers migrating from city to city
We must look to the Lord that some will be burdened to go, and all of us should be willing to be burdened to go
If we are here as a local expression of the Lord's Body without an increase locally and a spreading universally, we are wrong
We must be so living and burning all the time for a certain amount of increase locally and for a measure of spreading universally
We must spread the Lord's testimony to many cities in this country and Canada, as well as to Mexico, Central and South America and Europe
The increase and spread builds up the church in each locality as well as the Body of Christ throughout the earth
Meetings supply the saints with the Spirit, teach the saints with the Word, and keep the saints in the fellowship of the Triune God
When we come together we should present this Christ whom we have experienced and offer Him to God to be His food
As it takes doctors to handle sickness and lawyers to handle legal disputes so some assume that it takes pastors to handle Christian worship
Then in Acts 4:24-31 it is recorded, 'And when they heard this, they lifted up their voice with one accord to God and said
1 Corinthians 1426 says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
The saints around the time of Pentecost broke bread every day, that is, they had the remembrance of the Lord by practicing the Lord's table
Acts 12:12 tells us that when Peter was released from prison, he went to the house of Mary where a group of saints were praying
There are two kinds of meetings: small meetings in the homes of the believers and large meetings in a larger meeting place
We have two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, two lips, two shoulders, two arms, two hands, two thighs, two legs, and two feet
In the larger meeting place, we should not have any definite speaker with all the congregation listening to this speaker
In such a meeting all the attendants should participate in the building up of the church through their functions
When we come together one may have a revelation another may have a hymn another one may have a teaching and others may have another portion
After seeing the Lord openly ascend to the heavens on a cloud, the disciples stayed in Jerusalem to wait for the power from on high
If they had been praying at home, the Spirit could not have been poured out upon the assembled believers in order to form the Body
After His resurrection, the Lord showed Himself to over five hundred brothers at one time ; however, many of the brothers were not present
On the day of Pentecost, after the outpouring of the Spirit, the disciples preached the gospel and 3,000 people were baptized
The Christian way of meeting together is fitting to God's New Testament economy, differing from the Judaic way of meeting in the synagogues
It describes the heart being simple, single, and plain, having one love and desire and one goal in seeking the Lord
In all of our meetings there should be four basic factors and elements: the word, the spirit, praying, and singing
If we handle these four elements in a proper and living way, there will be a rich display and expression of Christ in all of our meetings
The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us that it may operate and minister these riches into our being
When we refer to the spirit, we are following the apostle Paul to denote our spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit
The strangest thing is this-we are supposed to be the speaking people of the speaking God, yet we do not speak
My intention and my burden is that the saints would learn how to speak forth Christ properly, to speak in the Spirit and with the Spirit
Without the meetings, there can be no practical expression of the church, and the Lord's speaking is restricted
In this lesson we will fellowship concerning one of the most crucial ministries of the church-the prayer ministry
After you study this lesson and practice accordingly, you will be a proper serving one in the prayer ministry of the church
As in mathematics and science, once people understand a given principle they can achieve predictable and consistent results every time
There are many steps required to achieve this goal, such as our friends' salvation, reading the Word and prayer, coming to meetings, etc
We have already mentioned how God has His will concerning all things, but that He will do nothing by Himself alone and independently
Many devotional prayers, prayers of fellowship, and prayers of request cannot be a substitute for prayer as ministry or work
If all our prayers are simply devotional or merely consist of fellowshipping and asking, our prayer is too small
Just here a problem arises: Will there be men on earth who will first bind what God wants to bind and loose what He intends to loose?
We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, yet we can restrict Him from doing that which He does want to do
They prayed again with the church after they were threatened by the Jews, and were told not to preach by the name of Jesus
Their prayer caused an earthquake; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness
After Paul had fellowship with the elders from the church in Ephesus, they prayed by the ship Paul was to take
After having the proper fellowship with God in prayer, a foundation is laid for us to go on to petition God for His work
Because of our proper fellowship, the Lord is able to impart into us His burden for a particular person or matter
Sometimes He does not act immediately because we may still have some hidden problems not yet confessed; or His timing requires that we wait
Finally, this type of prayer shows us how to approach our friends, what to say to them, what verses to use, etc
Many times we claim that we do not know what to say, or that we are afraid, or that we cannot get anyone saved
We love Him, and we want Him to accomplish His hearts desire; therefore, we must pray at set times and all the time
After the answer comes, you may give the Lord thanks and write down the date, and how your prayer was answered
To say that a priest is a person who serves God is right, but to say that to serve God is merely to do something for God, is wrong
He must contact God be filled with God and be possessed by God completely that he may be built up with others in the flow of the life of God
The main function of a priest is not to work, but to spend time in the presence of the Lord until he is one with Him in the spirit
Positionally or objectively, we need to be separated so that we may be filled with the holy God dispositionally or subjectively
When we arrive at the ark we come 'to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help''
By abiding in the holy of holies, we will know what the Lord desires and what He is burdened for, that we may pray accordingly
1 Peter 2:9 talks about telling out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light
Virtues of Him means His excellence His power His energy the strength of life received through the gospel that delivered us out of darkness
As we are being built up, more priests become saved and are added to the priesthood to be built up together with us
According to God's principle in His creation, He ordained to have a new year, a new month or a new moon, and a new day
It helps to have your morning revival material by your bed before you go to sleep, so you do not have to look for it in the morning
You need to pray unceasingly to fellowship with the Lord, by calling on His name and by using the verse you memorized in the morning
In Acts 20:27 the apostle Paul said that he 'did not shrink from declaring to the saints all the counsel of God'
Therefore, you must teach the new ones everything you know about the Lord, His economy, His recovery, His church, etc
If a new one asks a question that you cannot adequately answer, others may be better prepared to answer accurately
The last point concerning our practice of the priesthood concerns prophesying in the church meetings to build up the church
If we are faithful, the life and number in the church will increase and the Lord will build His church through us
In the next five lessons, we will clarify our role in the church life so that we may participate in the building up of the church
It is clear that the first blessing we receive from the Father is His choosing and predestinating of us to be His sons
Because the church is made up of the many sons of the Father, we who were chosen and predestinated are the constituents of the church
Ephesians 1:7 says, 'In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace'
God must redeem us, forgive us, and cleanse us from our sins to prepare us to be building material for the church
Nobody can stop us, not even the devil himself, from accomplishing God's purpose-the building up of the church
The way we experienced all these things is by believing and being baptized after hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of our salvation
We entered the church by the Father's choosing, the Son's redemption, the Spirit's regeneration, our believing, and our baptism
If you see this vision, your spontaneous reaction will be to give yourselves absolutely to Christ for the building up of the church
Sometimes you may be discouraged by the condition of the church, or because the condition of the church does not match the heavenly vision
We should tell them that heaven and earth will pass away, but His Word will not pass away until everything is fulfilled
We should not lose heart because we have the New Testament ministry to encourage and supply us for the building up of the church
Young brothers and sisters, set your whole heart, whole mind, and whole soul to love the Lord Jesus for the building up of His church
Some may say that they see the Body, yet their attitude is wrong; having a wrong attitude creates problems in the church
Many who do not see this vision, consider themselves as individual Christians, saved by the Lord from going to hell so they can go to heaven
We must pray and study the Word until we fully see the vision of the Body, and are conscious of the Body of Christ
All of us who were born of God and have been baptized into the Body of Christ cannot help but love one another
The plague of individualism can grow from simply expressing one person's individualism to that of several persons
You may notice in the church that three or five, perhaps even eight or nine persons will sometimes form a small circle
In order to participate rightly in the Lord's work, it is imperative that we deal with this matter of independent labor
The moment God's children perceive the oneness of the Body, they immediately comprehend the oneness of the work
The instant they see that the Body is one, they are delivered from their individual endeavor since they now see the work of the Body
As Christians, we should admire and seek for spiritual things, but we ought not have any emulative pretensions nor any trace of jealousy
We should be faithful to the portion which the Lord has given each of us; but we should also respect the portion He gives to others
If we are asked which is better, the hand or the eye, we can only answer that the hand and the eye are both good
He will not project himself to a distinctive position in order to compare himself favorably with others or even to occupy another's place
He who sees the Body of Christ most spontaneously sees not only the stupidity of independent action but the need for fellowship as well
We must not only submit to the direct authority of the Head, we need also to submit to the indirect authority of the Head
Consequently, whoever sees the Body of Christ sees also the authority which God has set in the Body of Christ for him to submit to
They seem to regard themselves as being the greatest to such an extent that they fail to recognize anyone to whom they could submit
According to our experiences over the past years, ambition has been the source of all the problems in the church life
It is good that while you are young you see the vision concerning the church and are developing a burden to build up the church
Be careful, your time may run out like everyone else if you do not set your heart on the Lord's building today
He and his three friends, who were of the children of Judah, were selected to come into the king's palace to be taught
Daniel and his three friends purposed in their heart not to be defiled, not to have any share in that defiling element
For Daniel and his three friends not to eat the king's food was to protest, to be God's testimony, against the tide of idolatry
If we have four companions to support us from each direction, we will not fall, regardless of what storm may come
If we love the Lord, we should be able to go to any young brother or sister, not caring for what they are like
2:1, 'I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men'
The best way to develop such a habit is to pray every time we think about someone and every time we have to do something or say something
When a group comes together, one brother may ask the others if they can speak something concerning the assurance of salvation
The young people should thoroughly fellowship matters such as the assurance of salvation and regeneration in their groups
If they do not, we may eventually have a good number of saints among us, but they will not be thoroughly rooted in spiritual matters
If five young people cannot speak clearly to each other about the assurance of salvation, how can they help others?
The young ones should be helped to know what the assurance of salvation is, what regeneration is, and what eternal life is
If each group covers one or two points a week, after half a year they will have covered thirty or forty basic points
The companions need to fellowship with one another, pray, seek the Lord in the Word, and preach the gospel together
We who love the Lord and want to serve Him should go and preach the gospel of the kingdom until there is no place left to go
We also need to come to the full knowledge of the truth in order to help others come to the full knowledge of the truth
After tasting its sweetness, you will know sugar is sweet, experientially, and no one will be able to convince you otherwise
They do not really know nor have they experienced the truth to the extent that no one could convince them otherwise
The universal church is comprised of many local churches; therefore, local churches need to be established throughout all the earth
They should be full of the Spirit to express the Triune God as lampstands in the dark, evil, and perverse world
We are co-laborers with God, partners of Christ, and the reprint of the Spirit to carry out this great purpose of God
Prayer causes the Father to give us those we ask for, and enables the Lord to bring to earth what has been done in heaven
The best way to disciple all the nations is to preach to all the creation, to witness to all the nations, and to bear much fruit
They may know many things from the Bible, but they do not know the crucial truths concerning God's full salvation
Most of them do not know the three stages of salvation, nor do they know the truth concerning sanctification and transformation
Some people desire to preach the gospel in the uttermost parts of the earth, yet they do not preach where they presently live
You may be persecuted for the Lord's sake, yet you will not give up because you know that great is your reward in the heavens
You may be very discouraged at times, yet simply touching the God of all encouragement will revive your spirit
In this final lesson we will reveal the lives of four men whose human living became our pattern for the building up of the church
He went through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension for the building up of the church
He continued to preach Christ to build up the church despite the fact that he was threatened, beaten, and put in jail
Praise the Lord for our brother, Peter, who was faithful to the end, preaching and laboring for Christ and the building up of the church
The wonderful 'Me'' that he saw was the universal new man, the Body of Christ, with the Head in the heavens and the Body on the earth
He tried his best to excel in the Jewish religion even to the extent of persecuting the church with threatening and murder
We are those who did not have a direct heavenly vision like Paul, yet we see from his ministry in his epistles
Paul said in Philippians 317 Be imitators together of me brothers and observe attentively those who thus walk as you have us for an example
He was not taking the lead, yet he was one with and in full support of Peter, who at that time was taking the lead
The Lord showed only him the last revelation-the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the mingling of Christ and the built-up church
One day, we will all line up together to receive a reward having been faithful in enjoying Christ for the building up of the church
