<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST BECOMING MORE PRECIOUS IN THE HOUSE</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 42 to 45</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 42:1, 4; 43:3-4; 45:1-17</h1><h2 class=head1>BOOK II—PSALMS 42 TO 72</h2><p>Now we come to Book II, composed of Psalms 42 to 72. As this book indicates how the saints experience God and His house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ, so it begins with the words: “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God” (42:1). The saints, being stripped by God, desire to seek God Himself. Then the Psalmist goes on, “My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God”—not for the law, not for knowledge, but for the living God Himself. The Psalmist continues by asking, “When shall I come and appear before God?” Today we have the answer to this question. We come and appear before God when we come into the local church. Verse 4: “When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God.” This was the remembrance of the enjoyment of the house of God. That was the time when he appeared before God. When shall I come and appear before God? When I come with the multitude to the house of God, when I enter His house, when I am in His presence, that is the time I appear before Him.<p>Brothers and sisters, let me check with you. Where is it that you sense most deeply that you are in God’s presence? I believe that you must answer that you sense God’s presence the most when you are in the local churches. I cannot tell you how many times, when I was in the meetings of the local churches, I was just before God. When I came with the multitude to the house of God, to the local church, I appeared before Him.<p>Then we read, “I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise.” Even before we enter the house, there is joy and praise. I believe that this is the best verse to tell us the way to come to the meetings. Firstly, we must come with the multitude—it is better not to come by ourselves. Secondly, we should come with the voice of joy and praise. While we are on the way, either walking or driving, we may start the praising. Come to the meetings with the multitude; come to the meetings with the voice of joy and praise. I hope that one day, when Christians are going to the church meetings, everyone around will realize that they are on their way to the meeting because they are praising. Even in ancient times the Old Testament saints came to the house of God in such a wonderful way. How much more should we!<p>Psalm 43:3-4: “O send out thy light and thy truth.” For what? For knowledge, for teaching, for doctrines? No. “Let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.” The divine light plus the divine truth, the light and the reality, will bring us to the holy hill. How can we ascend into the hill of His holiness? By being led by the divine light and the divine reality. Hence we should pray today, “O God, send me Thy light and Thy reality; let them lead me; let them bring me unto Thy holy hill and to Thy tabernacles, the local churches.”<p>Again, have you seen the improvement? Now the saints desire to enjoy the house of God. They are so much for the hill and for the house of the Lord. This is far beyond any human concept we may naturally have. We need heavenly vision.
