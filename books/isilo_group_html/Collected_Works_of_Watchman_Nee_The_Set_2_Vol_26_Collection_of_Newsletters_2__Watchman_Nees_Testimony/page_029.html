Thank you. We separated from the Brethren about four months ago. Thank the Lord that He Himself led us this way. We felt quite awhile ago that the Brethren were a denomination in a different form because they have much of the color of the denominations that is contradictory to our faith. At the time we wanted to move carefully, so we prayed earnestly before the Lord and waited patiently for about three years. Although we suspected they were a denomination very early on, we never heard of any precedent of leaving the Brethren. In addition, we also heard brothers in other localities say that the Brethren were not a denomination. For this reason we were forced to go before God to consider our doubts carefully because we were afraid that separating from them would be a careless move which would divide the Lord's Body. Therefore, we patiently waited for the Lord's leading. When the Lord's time came, we could not but obey God and separate ourselves from them.</p><p>We never thought that we would first leave a denomination, only to enter another by mistake. We really feel ashamed. Every time we think of it, we break out in a sweat! The second time we left the denominations, the circumstances were even more difficult to deal with. The other party does not understand our faith and suspects that we have entered into a heresy. However, the Lord gave us an opportunity to testify of the truth concerning the church. We did not separate from them over different interpretations of the Bible. We separated because we have clearly seen that Christ is the center of our meetings; the truth is not the center. We discovered that the Brethren have two points of error: (1) They do not allow Christ to be the Head in everything, and (2) they have the regulations of man's will and an invisible organization everywhere.</p><p>We thank the Lord that in this experience He showed us what to be careful about. If our flesh is not dealt with by the cross severely, we may also become a different form of denomination! A study of the history of the Brethren shows that they began when many Western brothers left the denominations. They too announced that the denominations were not according to the Bible. Unfortunately, they became an invisible denomination. We confess that the Brethren Church is the best denomination among denominations, but our question is not what kind of denomination it is but whether or not it is a denomination. If a meeting has been stained with any color of the denominations, it is an abomination to God. We should separate ourselves from it.</p><p>Thank the Lord, although there are not many people meeting in the Lord's name in Singapore (56 Hsiao P'o Hu Lau Lueh Sha Lu, Singapore), the Lord is to be praised because His light shines on our way. May the Lord Himself lead us from now on so that we do not go astray by mistake. Our present need is the prayers of the brothers. Peace in the Spirit!</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Wang K'ai Sen, Chang Chia Chi, Tseng K'ai Hao<br />November 16</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER SIMON MEEK</h2><p>Dear saints:</p><p>We received both The Glad Tidings and The Christian. Thank the Lord for His messages in them. The need in our locality is very great. We hope you can continue to send them. (We need at least thirty copies of each publication. I will pass them out carefully.) May the Lord continue supplying Himself to us. Amen, amen.</p><p>I would like to say a few personal words. The Lord Himself has recently cared for many aspects of the work in our locality. We really thank Him for His grace. However, there is still much need. We ask you all to pray for us. Recently, I have been very weak physically. I feel in particular that I cannot keep up. I am in the mountains for a short rest. Soon I will have to return to my place of work. I hope you all will pray for me both in the meetings and individually. I also hope you will pray even more for the work so that the believers may be perfected and sinners may be saved and added to the Lord's church daily.</p><p>I hope that Brother Watchman can come for a visit and help us. Please pray for this so that the Lord's will may be done. Amen.</p><p>The time is pressing; the Lord is coming quickly. The fiercer the battle, the greater the tribulations. We should be watchful and pray, endure, and be bold to be overcomers waiting to be raptured. Greetings to Brothers Watchman, Kuang Jung, Shou Ling, and Witness.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Simon Meek<br />October 6</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
