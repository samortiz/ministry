   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Between 1928 and 1934, Brother Watchman Nee conducted four Overcomer Conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The subjects of these conferences were on God s Central Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first conference was held in February 1928 on the subject: God s Eternal Purpose and the Victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second conference was held in October 1931 on the subject: The Covenant of God and the Wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third conference was held in January 1934 on the subjects: Christ as the Centrality and Universality of God and God s Overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fourth conference was held in October of the same year on the subjects: The Life of Abraham and Spiritual Warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Except for the fourth conference, which was held in Hangchow, all the other conferences were in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The messages of the Third Overcomer Conference were first published in three issues of the magazine The Present Testimony, published by Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this present edition, Chapter 1, entitled Preparation Messages of the Third Overcomer Conference, presents short messages given in the first two days of the conference, January 22 and 23, 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapters 2 and 3, entitled God s Center or The Centrality and Universality of Christ and The Overcomer of God, present the main parts of the conference messages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The chapter on The Overcomer of God has been additionally supplemented with a section, The Experience of the Overcomers taken from Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi s notes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two of the outlines presented in Chapter 1 were published in more polished form later; thus, Ministering to the House or to God? and A Shallow Life, are included as Chapters 4 and 6.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A separate message which was not part of the Third Overcomer Conference, Having Been Made Dead to the Law, is included in this volume as Chapter 5 to retain the original order of the messages as they appeared in The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Chapters 7 and 8, What Are We? and Questions Related to the Workers, were translated from notes by Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These messages were released during and after the same conference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What Are We? points out the testimony that God is after, based on the history of the recovery of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Questions Related to the Workers covers the nature of the work and its relationship with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although these messages were not published in The Present Testimony, we have included them here with the messages released during this period.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The nature and burden of this conference can be found in Watchman Nee s note, A Letter Concerning the Third Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A more detailed report of the conference can be found in Issue No. 4 of Collection of Newsletters in Set Two of The Collected Works.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A LETTER CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus is Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1 Cor 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have previously held two conferences of the same nature, one in February of 1928 and one in October of 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The conference held in November of last year was of a different nature, and for that reason we consider the upcoming conference to be the third overcomer conference.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I want all the brothers to understand the nature of this type of conference; no attention will be paid to the less significant matters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we want to see in the Holy Spirit is Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Matters such as prophecy, church organization, Scripture exposition, types, baptism, laying on of hands, speaking in tongues, miracles, and a hundred other questions have their proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As Christians we should not deny them their proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, these are neither the center of the Scriptures nor the center of the life of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has only one center, which is Christ Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our annual conferences of this nature are to bring us back to this center.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we are reluctant to mention any minor matters in these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we would emphasize only the central point which God Himself stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people often ask us why The Present Testimony does not print some of the articles similar to those in the previous magazine, The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, they do not realize that The Present Testimony only delivers the central message of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many of the gospel messages, interpretations of prophecy, Bible expositions, and answers to questions are not God s center.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a pity that many believers treasure our writings on these side issues, but neglect the central message.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not saying that the other subjects are useless; they do have their place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, they are not the center.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a person has not laid hold of God s center, all these truths will only be doctrines to him and will not give him any help.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Knowing God in His center, and living in the center is victory, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything else follows afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In our conference this time, as before, we wish to lay stress on the central message.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After much prayer I feel the theme which the Lord has given me for this conference is God s Overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything in the conference will focus on this center.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since the dates are now set, I ask all the brothers to pray more for this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unlike the conference in 1928, our conferences in 1931 and 1932 were both lacking in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Consequently, we saw no obvious blessing in those meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should, therefore, ask God for a burden to pray and for a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to pray and pray fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps we even have to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, we must pray in the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether or not God will bless us depends upon our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Finally, in this conference, our hope is to meet Christ, to receive light and revelation from heaven, and to be filled with the life that is unknown to ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not intend to pay attention to the many minor, outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To know Him Phil 3:10 this is what we seek.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>December 13, 1933</S>
