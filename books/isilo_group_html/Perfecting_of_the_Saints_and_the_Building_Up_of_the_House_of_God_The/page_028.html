CHRIST AS OUR LIFE AND<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>In our visit to the different places we observed that believers do not know Christ as life, and they do not have the building up of God&rsquo;s house. Suppose some brothers go to Japan because of the need there. They must help people know that God in Christ desires to be man&rsquo;s life, and they must build up the house of God so that God has a dwelling place on earth and God&rsquo;s children have a home. There is such a need in Japan. When we visited Japan, we went to Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe. These places are close to each other and conveniently located. However, the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is not in these three cities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even though the United States is a Christian country, there is a need to help people know Christ as life and to build them up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place locality by locality. This also applies to Europe. In a message I gave in Europe, I said that it is difficult to find a place in Scandinavia that resembles God&rsquo;s house. God&rsquo;s children are stirred up, but they feel as if they are homeless. Hence, the knowledge of life and the building up of the church are needed everywhere.</p>
<p>There is nothing in southern Europe, because the influence of Catholicism is very strong there. Spain, Portugal, Italy, and even France are Catholic countries. Greece is located in southern Europe, and it is spiritually and materially desolate. The entire situation in Europe is desolate. Thus, there is a great spiritual need in Europe. There is also such a need in different places in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Every place needs to know Christ as life and to have the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place so that the believers can have a home. There is a need for life and the church. Even though we often feel that we are weak and poor, God has bestowed His grace upon us. It is difficult to find a place that is as blessed as we are.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we know that this way is one hundred percent of the Lord, but on the other hand, it is difficult to see anything like this in church history. Furthermore, we seem to be the only believers who are taking this way. We are sure that this is of the Lord, but when we are weak, we ask whether we are wrong or if we are too much. Otherwise, why can we not find a similar situation in church history and why is there not another group to confirm this way? We seem to be the only ones who are taking this way.</p>
<p>We visited many countries on this trip and were strengthened in our inner realization. We also received a burden to see the need in every place. Japan, the United States, Scandinavia, and South America need a testimony like ours. This is the only thing that can meet the need of God&rsquo;s children today. The genuine need of God&rsquo;s children is to know Christ as life so that God can build up a house on earth among His children and so that His children can have a home.</p>
<p>Many Christians receive help from the messages that they listen to, but they do not know what their need is. We should lead them to know that Christ is our life. They also need to see that the result of Christ being our life is that God&rsquo;s house is built up for His children to have a home. Only these two things can satisfy the need of God&rsquo;s children. God&rsquo;s children in Japan, the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia confirmed this way of life. After we saw that this is the need in every place, our realization was strengthened, and we were encouraged.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE IMPORTANT MATTERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Co-workers Needing to Go Out<br />
and Work for the Lord</h2>
<p>We need a clear understanding that Christ is our life for the building up of God&rsquo;s house. At the beginning of this message I said that Christians highly regard any believers who meet the way we do. We believe that it is of the Lord that the churches in Taiwan, especially the church in Taipei, are highly regarded by other believers. If we are faithful to the Lord, He will give us a strong and definite leading and some of us will go to other places. We need to grasp this opportunity.</p>
<p>We have trained many saints. Some of the saints who are trained serve full time, and others have a job. There may be more saints who can serve full time and then go to serve in other places. Some saints can meet this need. As more saints rise up to meet this need, there will be a steady flow of saints who leave their jobs and serve full time. We cannot study indefinitely. We must have graduates. Every school must produce graduates. Similarly, it is not normal for the children in a family to not grow up. Therefore, we need to continually produce workers who can serve full time in other places.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Brothers and Sisters Needing to Emigrate</h2>
<p>In view of the overall situation, it is profitable for the brothers and sisters to consider migrating to other places. Some of them may get jobs abroad. This is an age of mobility that is not stagnant. Active people are mobile.</p>
<p>These are impressions from my trip abroad. We need saints to go out. The more the saints go out, the more the way will be opened to us. All the saints need to go out. This will profit the saint, his family, the church, and even the country. I do not want to exhort you too much. This is my fellowship in response to the request of the brothers. If ten to twenty families and a few workers migrate to Brazil, they could start meeting immediately. This would be a good testimony, and the result would be good.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Literature Work</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the literature work needs to be strengthened. In the past only a few saints helped in this work. The few publications that we put out are of three categories: <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine, booklets such as <em>Enjoying God,</em> and <em>Church News.</em> All three categories are effective. Hence, we need to strengthen the literature work in order to propagate overseas, and we need to increase the circulation of <em>Church News.</em> The serving ones also need to put out some publications in English. This will cause our testimony to spread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there are three crucial matters. Workers need to go and labor, brothers and sisters need to migrate, and the literature work needs to be increased and spread. In order to fulfill these needs there is the need for more manpower. I believe that there will be no shortage of manpower. We should not fear a shortage of manpower, because some saints are going out. Rather, we should believe that as more saints go out, more will be added to the labor. The brothers and sisters need to pray concerning this matter. We should all go before the Lord to seek a burden. It may be that some saints will receive the burden and be sent out by the Lord and labor for Him. Other saints may be led by the Lord to migrate abroad. Still others may be burdened to give money to meet the need. The Lord will surely give us a strong confirmation since this is His leading. The direction of the Lord&rsquo;s leading over the years is not merely limited to the island of Taiwan. The Lord is preparing us for the spread of His testimony in the last days.</p>
<p>Over the years we never advertised ourselves; nevertheless, during this trip, the Lord opened many doors for us. Before we went on the trip, our consideration of the actual situation was limited. What we saw, however, exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>The high regard Christians have for us causes us to be humble. It is unprecedented for a meeting and all the speaking to be handed over to someone else. But this was our experience in every place where we visited. This was of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit confirmed it. This fellowship is to give us an impression and to show what the Lord has done.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s work exceeds all our expectations. He has given us a broad and effective way. The brothers and sisters need to be strong and brave for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and receive His burden. Many places need our help. I do not want to initiate anything, and we do not want mere activity. This fellowship is for us to receive a burden and bring the blessings that we have received to the places that are in need.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
