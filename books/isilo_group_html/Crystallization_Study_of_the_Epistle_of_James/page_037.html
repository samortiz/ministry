The Tree of Life Being<br>a Great Blessing to the Redeemed</H2><P>The tree of life is a great blessing to the redeemed (Rev. 22:14, cf. v. 19). The greatest blessing is the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. James Speaking Only of the Crown of Life</H2><P>The Epistle of James, as a book stressing Christian perfection, only refers to the divine life in speaking of the crown of life as a reward promised by God to His lovers (1:12) but does not speak anything concerning the divine life to be the believers' life for their spiritual existence and the divine life's capacity and function. What a critical lack this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. JAMES MENTIONING THE CHURCH ONLY ONCE</H2><P>James mentions the church only once, charging the sick members of the church to ask the elders of the church to pray for healing (5:14), but he does not speak a bit concerning the church as the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God (Eph. 1:22-23; 4:4-6), which is the center and goal of God's eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-11) and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&#151;22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE EPISTLE OF JAMES NOT TELLING US<br>ABOUT THE FOLLOWING ITEMS</H2><P>In addition to its lack in the above six items, the Epistle of James does not tell us about the following items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Nature</H2><P>James does not tell us about the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Something that has the dog nature is a dog, and someone who has the human nature is a man. How wonderful it is that we have God's nature! We are partakers of His divine nature, so that makes us God in His nature but, of course, not in His Godhead. The Bible's teaching is very logical.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Hand of Love of God the Father<br>and the Hand of Grace of God the Son</H2><P>The hand of God the Father is of love and the hand of God the Son is of grace (John 10:28-29). Love and grace are one. Love is the source; grace is the manifestation. When love is expressed, it becomes grace. We can use a gift as an illustration of this. If someone gives you a New Testament, that is out of his love and is an expression of his love. This expression is a grace, which is free. The grace of the Son is the expression of the Father's love.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle of James &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
