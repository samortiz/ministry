   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. HAVING BEEN PLACED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE HEADING-UP CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first part of verse 11 says, In Whom also we were made an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Whom refers to the heading-up Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 10, which speaks of heading up all things in Christ, ends with the words in Him, and verse 11 begins with the words in Whom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul s composition here is rather awkward and repetitious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, Paul wrote this way purposely in order to emphasize the fact that all things in heaven and on earth are headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In emphasizing this fact, Paul did not care for excellence of composition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words in Whom reveal that we have been placed into the heading-up Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HAVING BEEN MADE AN INHERITANCE TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the heading-up Christ we also were made an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word also in verse 11 refers to the heading up of all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All things are to be headed up in Christ, and we also have been made an inheritance in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Christ we were made an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please pay close attention to the tense here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the future, all things will be headed up in Christ, but already we were made an inheritance in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek words rendered were made an inheritance can also be translated have obtained an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek verb means to choose or assign by lot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, this clause literally means we were designated as a heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were made an inheritance to inherit God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, we were made God s inheritance v. 18 for God s enjoyment; and, on the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance v. 14 for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Which do you think is greater, for us to be made an inheritance or for God to head up all things in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would say that being made an inheritance is much better than being headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our being made God s inheritance opens the way for Him to head up all things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we have been made an inheritance already, we need to ask ourselves whether or not we live as God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you live as one who is the inheritance of God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you look like God s inheritance or like a lump of clay?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can clay be God s inheritance?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In ourselves we certainly are not worthy to be God s inheritance, but we have been made an inheritance in the heading-up Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to our natural being, we are not worth anything, but in the heading-up Christ we were made God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is by having God wrought into us that we are being constituted into an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is still working Himself into us today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most of us are part clay and part gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The part that is gold is God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I thank God that as the process of being made God s inheritance goes on, the gold in us is increasing and the clay is decreasing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not stop with the mere objective teaching about being the inheritance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many years ago I was taught that we are God s inheritance, and I was very happy to hear this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually I discovered that I am nothing but clay.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seemed absurd that clay could be God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After much experience and study of the New Testament, I learned that we are still in the process of becoming God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this process the natural life must be eliminated, and the gold, the divine nature, must increase by being wrought into more of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When this process has been completed, we shall be fully the inheritance of God not only objectively, but also subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The process of being made God s inheritance goes along with the heading up of all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we are willing to be headed up in Christ, the more the gold, the divine element, will increase within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is transformation; it is also subjective sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In subjective sanctification our being is saturated with God s substance, God s essence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As God s element is wrought into our being, we become His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yes, we have already been placed in the heading-up Christ, but we are still in the process of being made His inheritance in full.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A. Having Been Predestinated</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To make us His inheritance, God the Father has predestinated us to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The process of making us God s inheritance is based upon and is according to God s eternal predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is now working on us to reach the goal of His predestination.</S>
