<h2 class=head2>Attaining to the Out-resurrection</h2><p>In chapter three of Philippians, the word resurrection is used twice. The first time it refers to the resurrection power by which we are conformed to the death of Christ (v. 10). Then verse 11 says, “If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.” Many translations of this verse are not adequate; the translators neglected the first part of the Greek word for resurrection because they did not have the proper light. The word resurrection is composed with a prefix and should be translated extra-resurrection or out-resurrection. The out-resurrection is something special. Many verses in the New Testament tell us that at the coming of the Lord Jesus, all the saved persons who have died in the Lord will be resurrected. However, there is a difference in the way they will participate in that resurrection. Of all those who share in that resurrection, some will enjoy a special resurrection, an outstanding resurrection. This may be compared to a graduating class. Although all the students graduate, only the top ones share an outstanding graduation, an “extra-graduation.” Paul was pursuing this special resurrection.<p>The out-resurrection is nothing less than a special portion of Christ experienced by us. A special portion of Christ will be awarded to certain ones. This is similar to the hidden manna, which is different from the open manna (Rev. 2:17; Exo. 16:14-15). Both the open manna and the hidden manna are a type of Christ, but the hidden manna is a special portion. Christ is the resurrection in a general way (John 11:25), but Christ as the out-resurrection is a special portion of Christ as a reward.<h2 class=head2>Counting All Things as Loss in Order to Gain Christ</h2><p>All young believers should learn to recite Philippians 3:7 and 8. Paul says, “But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.” What things in verse 7 refers to the religious things, the things in Judaism as mentioned in the previous verses. Paul dropped all those religious things for Christ. In verse 8, however, Paul dropped not only the religious things but all things on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. All the above verses show us that Christ is not only our life and pattern but also our goal and our aim. We drop all other things and pursue nothing but Christ. Our goal is to gain Christ.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS OUR SECRET AND POWER</h2><h2 class=head2>Being Initiated with the Basic Principles to Solve Every Problem</h2><p>Chapter four reveals to us that Christ is our secret and our power, our strength. Verses 12 and 13 say, “I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.” In Greek the phrase I have learned the secret means “I have been initiated.” This may be illustrated by mathematics. When we teach a young student addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we initiate him by giving him the basic principles. In this way he learns the secret. Whenever he comes across a problem in mathematics, he knows the secret of how to solve it.<p>Christ is not only our power but our secret. We live by this power, and we live by this secret. Then whatever matter comes to us, we can solve it. Because we know the secret, we do not care whether we are rich or poor or whether we are abased or we abound. The unbelievers in the world are foolish because they do not know the secret. They are like people who have never learned the principles of mathematics; no matter what problem they come across, they cannot solve it. We are not this kind of person. We have been initiated in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ. Because Christ is our secret, we know how to face any kind of situation. Whether people honor us or despise us, we know the secret and we have the power. Christ is our secret, and Christ is also our power.
