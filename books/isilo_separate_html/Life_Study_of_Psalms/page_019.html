Psalm 1 is according to the human concept of uplifting and treasuring the law, whereas Psalm 2 is according to the divine concept of exalting Christ as God's central stress.</P><P>Perhaps we can receive further help by considering stanza 3 of Hymns, #541:</P><blockquote>Not philosophy nor<br>Any element<br>Can to Christ conform us<br>As His complement;<br>But 'tis Christ Himself who<br>All our nature takes<br>And in resurrection<br>Us His members makes.</blockquote><P>No philosophy, element, or religion can conform us to Christ. The law of Moses cannot conform us to Christ. Only Christ can conform us to Himself, and nothing else. Some may be bothered that we are belittling religion. They may say, "We are Christians; shouldn't we love Christianity?" But we need to be those who love Christ, not any "anity." Nothing can or should replace Christ.</P><P>Christ conforms us to Himself so that we can be His complement. To be Christ's complement means that we are a part of Him. This is like Eve being a complement to Adam. Only Christ can make us a part of Him as His complement. The law cannot make us members of Christ. Only Christ can make us His members in resurrection.</P><P>We need to see Psalm 1 in the light of the economy of God. This psalm says that those who meditate in the law will be like a tree absorbing the water from the streams, but according to the New Testament revelation this is not very high. Eventually, the New Testament tells us that the river of living water gets into us (John 7:38; 4:14). Do we want to be a tree by the side of a river or do we want to have the river flowing within us? Which is better and which is higher? The thought of a river flowing within us is the ultimate concept of the Bible (Rev. 22:1). To be a tree planted by the river to absorb its supply of water is good, but it is not the best. Paul said that he planted and Apollos watered (1 Cor. 3:6). The thought here is the same as that of a tree absorbing water, but this is not as high as the thought of the river of water of life flowing within us. This is God's ultimate thought.</P><P>In my youth I was taught that when we study the Bible, we have to get the secret of the Bible. Later, Brother Nee told us that we have to know the spirit of the Bible. The Bible, the written Word, has a spirit. The Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" (John 6:63). This shows us that the Word is the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). Not only is the Spirit in the Word, but also the Word itself is the Spirit. Furthermore, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God." The Word is God, and the Word is the Spirit. Thus, God, the Word, and the Spirit are one.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
