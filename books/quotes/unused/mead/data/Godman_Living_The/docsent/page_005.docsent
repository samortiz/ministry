   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I would ask: Of these two births which one receives more of our attention the first birth of our parents or the second birth of God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not pay attention to our first birth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should remember only one birth, our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Day by day, we should not forget that we are children of God, born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</S>
