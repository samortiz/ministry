   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 12 also tells us that they ate the lamb with their loins girded, with their shoes on their feet, and with their staff in their hand v. 11 . The children did not eat the lamb in a sloppy or a slow way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They ate the lamb in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that all of them stood while they ate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their loins were girded, their shoes were on their feet, and they had a staff in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose they had the blood covering them without the meat for them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God may have given them the commandment to gird their loins, put their shoes on their feet, take their staff, and be in haste to get out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If this had been the case, they would have still been hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although they would have had the blood covering them, they would have still been empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without eating, they would not have had the energy to leave Egypt in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This picture shows us that the eating of the lamb was for moving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life is for us to move.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While they were eating, they were getting ready to get out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we take our meals, we usually sit down and relax.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But during the Passover, the children of Israel ate in haste because eating was for them to move.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a new beginning, not of creation but the beginning of redemption for life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MANNA</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The record of the history of God's people refers again and again to the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the children of Israel came out of Egypt, the matter of eating was of central importance in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They began to eat manna.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Mystery</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word manna in Hebrew means "What is it?" or "What is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the morning when the children of Israel first saw this small, round, white thing on the ground, they did not know what it was.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, they asked one another, "What is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"What is this?" is the meaning of the word manna.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may know what corn and wheat are, but what is this?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To the people of the world Christ is manna, that is, He is "what is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The professors may know physics, mathematics, history, and geography but when it comes to Christ they would ask, "What is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the real manna, the real "what is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the heavenly food on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On this earth there is nothing like manna.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Manna, the heavenly Christ as our heavenly food, is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Taste of Honey and Fresh Oil</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The manna had the taste of honey and of fresh oil Exo 16:31; Num 11:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we eat the manna, we enjoy the honey and the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oil in the Bible signifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this manna is the taste of the Spirit and the taste of honey.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Honey is the mingling of two lives, the animal life and the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The honey bees which produce honey receive the supply from flowers, from the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As our manna, Christ has this element of the mingling of the animal life, the redeeming life, with the vegetable life, the generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This mingling is our sweet nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Small and Round</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exodus also tells us that the manna was small and round 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Darby s translation uses the word "fine" for small and the word "granular" for round.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fineness or smallness of manna means that it was ready and available to be taken in by God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The food taken in by us must be small enough to eat.</S>
