in the Shortage of Proper Leading Ones<br />
in the Migrations</h2>
<p>When the work began in the United States, we were in the first stage. On the one hand, there was no need for a training, and on the other hand, I did not have time to do the training. I needed more time for travel and other matters. This is the reason that before 1970 we did not have a formal training. However, beginning from 1968 we had an informal training. A great need for the informal training was related to migrations. After our summer conference in Los Angeles on Bonnie Brae Street in 1964, many were excited and wanted to go out to &ldquo;take the country&rdquo; in the way of migration. I did not feel that this was the time to go out. An army cannot go to fight without training. This only exposes them to the enemy. However, some still wanted to go out, and I did not insist that they stay. All who went out, though, returned in defeat by the end of the year. The following year we moved to Elden hall, and after two more years, in 1967, some still longed to go out to establish the local churches in other places. However, I still felt that the time was not ripe and that the migration should wait a few more years. Finally, in the fall of 1969, there was a migration from Yorba Linda to Seattle and from three small cities in Texas to Houston. Then in 1970 further migrations took place. Without exception, the first stage of all the migrations was a success. Although in the six years from 1964 to 1970 we had not had a formal training, a proper leadership had been produced among us. Wherever the migrations went, they went with a proper leadership; therefore, they were a success.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there were more migrations in 1973, but almost none was a success. This is because we were short of the proper leading ones. After remaining in the new localities for a year, many of the saints could not go on, but they dared not go back. They simply remained there in a suffering way. Eventually, many who had gone out consolidated into churches in certain major cities. This shortage of the proper leadership exposes our further need for training. At that time I went to the Lord very much concerning my ministry. The Lord has made it clear that my ministry in this country to serve the saints should be different from what it was in the previous twelve years. The previous twelve years was the first stage among us. I needed to travel for the setting up of the churches. Now there are thirty-five churches in this country, and my time and strength do not allow me to visit them all. Among the approximately five thousand saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there is not the adequate leadership. Even in Anaheim alone there are enough saints to become two churches, but we do not have the proper leadership to carry this out. Therefore, there is now the need of a continual training. The Lord has shown me that from now on I must spend all my time in the ministry for the training.</p>
<p>The training is not for acquiring mere knowledge. It is for practice and the proper discipleship. The training builds us up in the growth of life, in character, and in dealing with the natural disposition. Character is our disposition plus our habit. We need a change in our character. Even more deeply, the training touches our natural disposition. Strictly speaking, it is not our nature but our disposition that needs to be touched and dealt with. If we are trained in this way even for only a few months, we will see a difference.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF OUR SERVICE<br />
BEING TO MINISTER LIFE TO OTHERS</h2>
<p>The first point for our training is to realize that in the church service we do not do anything in the way of organization. The church is an organism, and what an organism needs is life. Therefore, our church service is mainly for ministering life to others. Even the arranging of chairs and the cleaning of restrooms are not for themselves; they are for ministering life. In ushering, clerical work, and any aspect of the church service, we must do everything to minister life to others. Of course, it is good for us to do things in a proper way. Not doing things well can be a frustration, but this does not mean that merely doing a good job is to have the proper service. In worldly religious organizations it is sufficient to do the jobs well, but in the church the main thing we need is the ministry of life. Even if we cannot do things very well, but by His mercy we minister life to others, the service is still successful. The main matter is to minister life to others.</p>
<p>Some may say that it is not we but the Lord Jesus who is the Life-giver. However, there is at least one verse in the New Testament that says we can give life to the weaker ones. First John 5:16a says, &ldquo;If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask and he will give life to him.&rdquo; <em>Life</em> here in Greek is not <em>bios,</em> the physical life; it is <em>zoe,</em> the spiritual life. This verse does not mean that if we pray for the brother&rsquo;s sickness, we can impart physical life to him. It is that we give him <em>zoe,</em> the spiritual life. We have the privilege of giving life to the weaker ones in order to swallow up their death. Many saints are not sick physically, but they are sick spiritually. They need us to pray for them and to give them life. We all need to be trained and to practice to take care of the weaker ones who are short of life and sick spiritually. In the churches it is often the case that death, rather than life, spreads from mouth to mouth. Therefore, there is the need of some stronger ones to minister life to stop the spread of death and to swallow up death. This is the main purpose of the service in the church.</p>
<p>The best opportunity for us to minister life to others is in the service groups. Many saints who have a heart for the Lord have been placed into these groups under the care of the responsible ones. The leading ones in the service should not care merely for doing things properly. The main thing they must do is care in life for all the ones who serve in the groups. They must help the saints not primarily to carry out the service; rather, they should fellowship with them and minister life to them so that they may grow. If the leading ones do this, spontaneously all the saints will do the same for others. Then the entire church will be under the care of the proper ministry of life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
