They were published in response to the criticism of a few concerning his teachings on the Trinity. The first one, The Revelation of the Triune God according to the Pure Word of the Bible, was released in 1976. It is a statement of his scriptural stand on this issue. In his statement Witness Lee cites several reputable authorities including Andrew Murray, Griffith Thomas, and J. Oswald Sanders. The second booklet, What a Heresy-Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods! was published the following year. This work challenged the heretical standing held by his critics and exposed their twisting of the Scriptures.<p>These booklets were evidently ignored by the authors of The New Cults, who reprinted their same accusations in subsequent publications. A number of their publications are still being circulated today by the Christian Research Institute (CRI) and others. It is for this reason that we are compelled to republish these clear statements by Witness Lee. It is a shame that writing done in the name of Christian research would deny the author&#8217;s plain words! These booklets remain a clear refutation of the critics&#8217; accusations and underline their reckless disregard for the truth of their publications. Best of all, they will help the seeker to examine the truth for himself.<p>In the first booklet Brother Lee gave a balanced scriptural definition of the Triune God by citing the Bible&#8217;s own words. He then identified the real point of contention-that all Three of the Triune God are one. One of the critics, Walter Martin, frustrated by his traditional understanding, considered this &#8220;confusing of the persons of the Trinity.&#8221; Yet by reading this booklet anyone can see for himself what the Bible plainly says. The Lord told the Pharisees, &#8220;You have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition&#8221; (Matt. 15:6b). May we not make that same mistake today!<p>In the second booklet Brother Lee focused upon the problems caused by forcing Scripture into traditional understanding. The result of denying the scriptural oneness of the Three of the Trinity issues in several heresies! Witness Lee examined in detail the crucial passages of Scripture such as Isaiah 9:6, 1 Corinthians 15:45, and 2 Corinthians 3:17. He exposed the twisting of the verses by his critics and charged them with heretical results. He boldly issued a challenge, &#8220;Let us wait and see how they can clear themselves from this charge.&#8221; Cal Beisner, another of the critical authors, later attempted to deny the clear context of 2 Corinthians 3:17 by saying that &#8220;the Lord&#8221; there is not Jesus, even though seven verses later Paul writes that we preach &#8220;Christ Jesus as Lord.&#8221; To date, none of the critics have issued one effectual argument to clear themselves of Witness Lee&#8217;s charge of heresy.<p>Another strong point of these booklets is the realization that God is triune, not just for doctrine, but that we could experience Him for the fulfilling of His purpose. Brother Lee concluded the first booklet, &#8220;The Triune God cannot be fully comprehended as a doctrinal matter by our limited mentality. The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment. God as a Trinity is for His economy, that is, for the dispensing of Himself into us to be our life and our everything.&#8221; This truth seems to have escaped the tradition-bound understanding of his critics. May the Lord use these words with more effect upon each reader of this book.<p>Dan Towle<p>Anaheim, California February 1994<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
