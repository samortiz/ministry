<p>The living water is a symbol of the Spirit (Exo. 17:6; John 4:10, 14; 7:38-39). Exodus 17:6 speaks of the living water coming out of the cleft rock. First Corinthians 10:4 tells us that the cleft rock was a rock that followed the children of Israel. The living water that flowed out of the cleft rock typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink. In John 4 the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that He had the living water to give her. Then in John 7 He said that rivers of living water would flow out of the innermost being of His believers. Out of our innermost being flows a river of patience, a river of comfort, a river of power, etc. Rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life of the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The river of water of life is another symbol of the Spirit (Rev. 22:1, 17b; 21:6b; Gen. 2:10-14; Psa. 36:8; 46:4; Ezek. 47:1, 5, 7-9, 12). This river of water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply. In Revelation 22:1 the water of life becomes a river proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Therefore, as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit as the river of water of life is the flow of the processed Triune God with Himself as the water of life to satisfy His chosen people that He may have an eternal manifestation to express Himself for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN LAMPS OF THE LAMPSTAND&mdash;<br />
THE SEVEN SPIRITS BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The Spirit is symbolized by the seven lamps of the lampstand, which are the seven Spirits before the throne of God (Exo. 25:37; Zech. 4:2, 10b; Rev. l:4c; 4:5b). The lampstand is mentioned in Exodus, Zechariah, and Revelation. God&rsquo;s people on this earth should be like a lampstand. In Exodus 25, the lampstand signifies Christ. In Zechariah 4 the lampstand signifies the people of Israel. Finally, the lampstands in Revelation 1 signify the churches (v. 20), which are the enlargement of Christ.</p>
<p>The lampstand has seven lamps, and these seven lamps are the Spirit for the expression of the Triune God. The lampstand has three aspects: the gold essence, the form, and the expression. The essence is the Father, the form is the Son, and the expression is the Spirit. Zechariah 4 reveals that the seven lamps refer to the Spirit. Then in Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps of fire burning before God&rsquo;s throne are the seven Spirits of God. The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven Spirits before the throne of God to execute God&rsquo;s administration on the whole earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB&mdash;<br />
THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD<br />
SENT FORTH INTO ALL THE EARTH</h2>
<p>In Revelation 5:6 the Spirit is symbolized by the seven eyes of the Lamb, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. The seven eyes of the Lamb are also the seven lamps of the lampstand. The lamps are for enlightening and burning; the eyes are for watching and observing and also for infusing and transfusing. As the redeeming Lamb, Christ has seven watching and observing eyes for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. These seven eyes are also transfusing all that the Lamb is into our being so that we may become the same as He is. Today the seven Spirits are moving to accomplish God&rsquo;s building for the fulfillment of His New Testament economy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
