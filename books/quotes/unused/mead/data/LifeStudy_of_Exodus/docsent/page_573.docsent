   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-NINE MOSES STAY WITH GOD 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 18 through 35 of Exodus 34 cover three important matters: God s charge to His people to feast and rest with Him, five conditions for enjoying the Lord, and God s infusion into Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the charge related to feasting and resting with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FEASTING AND RESTING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 18 the Lord says, You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then in verses 21 and 22 He goes on to speak of keeping the Sabbath and observing the feast of weeks and the feast of ingathering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these verses God commanded the people to feast with Him and rest with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I had been Moses, I might have said, Lord, when You called me to come to the mountaintop, You told me to bring two tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You promised to rewrite the Ten Commandments on these tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But now You wouldn t say a word about these commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, You are telling me that we should feast with You and rest with You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not God s intention that His people would try to keep the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s intention was to command His people to enjoy Him to feast with Him and rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is contrary to our natural desire to want always to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consider the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the prodigal son came back to his father, he said to the father, Make me as one of your hired servants Luke 15:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the returned prodigal wanted to do something for his father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The father, however, did not have the heart to listen to that kind of talk.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Immediately he said to the servants, Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry v. 23 . The father s desire was that they all would have a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In feasting together they would have enjoyment and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses did not know that it was not God s intention to charge His people to keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The keeping of the commandments must be secondary; it must be the issue of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the children of Israel would feast with the Lord properly and rest with Him continually, they would not have a problem in keeping the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This principle also applies to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we feast with the Lord every day and rest with Him during the day, everything will be all right in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, a brother may endeavor to be a good husband without feasting with the Lord and resting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, a sister may try to be a good wife without this feasting and resting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we do not feast with the Lord and rest in Him, we shall be a poor husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of trying to fulfill Ephesians 5, we should simply feast with the Lord a number of times during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the morning we should enjoy the feast of unleavened bread; during the day, the feast of Pentecost; and in the evening, the feast of tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The children of Israel enjoyed these feasts yearly, but we should enjoy them daily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, we should rest with the Lord many times throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The children of Israel had a Sabbath once a week, but we should have a Sabbath rest many times during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, every hour, we should rest with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we feast with the Lord and rest in Him in this way, we shall surely experience Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THREE FEASTS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Old Testament, God had ordained that seven feasts be observed annually by the children of Israel: the Passover, the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of firstfruit, the feast of weeks Pentecost , the feast of trumpets, the feast of atonement, and the feast of tabernacles also called the feast of ingathering or harvest .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The feast of unleavened bread was held immediately after the feast of Passover in the month of Abib, at the beginning of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abib, the first month of the year, indicates a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word Abib means a tender sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a very real sense, the feast of the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread were one feast.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say that the first day was the feast of Passover and the following days were the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that immediately after we enjoy the Passover, we need to cleanse ourselves of all leaven in order to keep the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For us today to keep the feast of unleavened bread means that we live a clean life, a life without sin, without leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The feast of firstfruit issues in the feast of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Between the feasts of unleavened bread and of ingathering, there is some enjoyment of the produce of the good land during the feast of firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Toward the end of the year, at the feast of ingathering, God s people had the full enjoyment of the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The feasts in Exodus 34 are all for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the beginning we may say that we have sowing and farming, and then we start to enjoy the produce.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But at the end we have the full harvest for our full enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The feasts that were observed in the intervals were not as crucial as far as the enjoyment of the good land was concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The important point here is that the record in Exodus 34 indicates that God wanted His people to have the full enjoyment of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In addition to the feasts, the children of Israel were to keep the Sabbath every week.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter how busy they were, they had to take one day a week to stop work and rest with the Lord.</S>
