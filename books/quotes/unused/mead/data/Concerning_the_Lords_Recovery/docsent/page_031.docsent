   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church life is just the Triune God doing everything in us, through us, and with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a church life is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the central thing that the Lord is going to recover.</S>
