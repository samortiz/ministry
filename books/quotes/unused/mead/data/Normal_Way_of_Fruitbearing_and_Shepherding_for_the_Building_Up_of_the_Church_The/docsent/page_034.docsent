   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Building Up Those under Our Care</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Also Care for Others</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also need to help the ones under our care to learn how to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if they were only recently saved, they can still care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone in the church life is a caretaker.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are all doing the work of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not need one person to pastor the church; the church shepherds itself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To build up people to care for others is a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Building Up Others to Know the Church</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must also help people to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To build people up in the foregoing four ways to function, to have a daily gospel-preaching life, to shepherd others, and to know the church requires us to have much exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because we are lacking in the proper building up, many sisters do not use their time well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sisters in the church should have carried out certain things, but they have not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because they do not know how to shepherd people in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even after a long time, someone under the care of the sisters may receive only a general help but nothing in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A few years ago the one being cared for may not have had certain particular experiences, but today she may still not have had them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only difference is that now she has learned something in a merely doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ones caring for her have passed on only knowledge to her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times we have charged the saints not to come together to gossip but to speak concerning spiritual things or pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We thank the Lord that many dear ones have taken this word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if we do not know how to shepherd people in the experiences of life, we will not have much to speak of when we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At first we can say, Let us pray-read something, but after doing this a few times, it will not be very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we stay on the line of the experiences of life, we will never be short of anything to speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will be like proper school teachers, knowing what grade people are in and what we should give them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, after contacting one another day after day, we will still remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fellowship in this chapter should give us an impression of what our real need is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why in the proper church life we need to spend some time to have a training, not simply church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the church meetings are too general, it is difficult to carry out a particular training in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The elders need to pick up the responsibility to build up the saints in the foregoing four basic items the stages of the experience of life, the enjoyment of Christ, the testimony of the church, and building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that the elders will bring this matter to the Lord and take time to consider how to keep the church on this line.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, we will be like today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE ESSENTIAL, BASIC ELEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>OF PROPER SHEPHERDING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No shepherding can be prevailing if we do not have a love for people, an interest in them, a burden for them, and adequate prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Love, interest, burden, and prayer are the essential, basic elements of proper shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Most of us were born with no interest in people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not like people, and we do not wish to be bothered by them, invited by them, or visited by them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We would rather live on top of a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is our natural tendency.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if we keep this kind of disposition, we will be finished with the building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to love the new ones as the Lord loves them, be interested them, and take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we must have a burden for them and adequate prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition, the fifteen practical points concerning shepherding in the previous chapter are very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to be patient, know how to deal with people, and know what to say and what not to say.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should know how to be positive yet not too quick, not for our sake but for the ones who are under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our basic need, however, is love, interest, burden, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would practice all these things, the church will grow in a proper way and be built up under the hands of all the saints, not only the elders or those with a special ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everyone in the service groups in the church life must build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no need to depend wholly upon the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes the elders cannot do the job adequately; therefore, we must all take up some part of the work of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the church will receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although it would be better to have a training on these matters all year round, what we have shared here should still give an impression of what we need to practice for the normal way of fruit-bearing and shepherding for the building up of the church.</S>
