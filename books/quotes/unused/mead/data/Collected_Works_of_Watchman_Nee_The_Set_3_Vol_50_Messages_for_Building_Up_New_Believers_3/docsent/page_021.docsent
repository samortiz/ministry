   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Attracting Attention</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we should take note of one thing: No one should wear anything that draws attention to his clothes rather than to his person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No Christian should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If our clothing always draws others' attention to us, there is something wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What we wear should express our being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I put a bouquet of flowers into a vase and others only pay attention to the vase, something is wrong with the vase.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Clothing is meant to express the person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our clothing should not usurp who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The worst thing would be for us to wear clothing that draws attention away from our person to our appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Clothing Needing to Match One's Status</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another matter needs special attention: A person's clothes should match his status.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not dress too poorly and do not dress too well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please bear in mind that poor clothing attracts attention in the same way that fancy clothing does.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not pay that much attention to our clothing, neither should we draw the attention of others to it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is wrong to give others the impression that we are particularly well dressed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, it is also wrong to be so poorly dressed that others begin to feel uneasy about us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our clothing must match our status.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others should not feel that we are too much or too poor in our attire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our clothing must glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Clothing Not Arousing Self-consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, our clothing should not arouse our own consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people are always conscious of what they wear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that something is wrong with their attire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They have become a coat hanger to their clothes, and their clothes have become more important than they are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are not wearing their clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, their clothes are wearing them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are always conscious of what they are wearing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They pay too much attention to their appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that their dress is either too good or too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a person is poorly dressed, he becomes conscious of his clothes in the company of others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he wears fancy attire, he becomes conscious of his clothes as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is best to wear something which does not arouse your attention or the attention of others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your clothes should be very ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the same time, it should match your status and should be worthy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anything that goes beyond this limit is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a great thing to present a Christian testimony in our attire today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that others can identify us as Christians by our appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us come next to the matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Genesis 2 God gave man food to sustain his life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This happened before man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The matter of food is found as early as Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Clothing began in Genesis 3, but food began prior to man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God ordained that man should partake of fruits of every kind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before man sinned, the God-ordained food for man was fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A. The Need for Meat after the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Genesis 3, after man fell, God gave man herbs for food and ordained that man would eat bread in the sweat of his face.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was God's food for man in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we come to Genesis 4, God put His seal of approval upon Abel but not Cain, even though no ordinance of any kind had yet been instituted.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Cain was a farmer, and Abel was a keeper of sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Abel shepherded sheep, and God's seal of approval was upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He offered sacrifices to God, and God accepted him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Cain was a tiller of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He brought the produce of the land to God, but God did not accept his sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Genesis 4 does not say anything about God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when we come to Genesis 9, God gave the animals to man for food v. 3 , just as He had given fruit to man for food in the beginning.</S>
