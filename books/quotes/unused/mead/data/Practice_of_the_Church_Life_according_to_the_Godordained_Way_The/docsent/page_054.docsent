   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From my youth I loved the United States, but all I knew of that country was by hearing others speak of it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the things I heard were very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then I came to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have been here for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the beginning, wherever I went my ministry was very warmly welcomed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nearly all the places I visited were inhabited mainly by Caucasians, and a good number of them were brought into the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But later on, I found out that Americans are seeking too much for pleasure, amusement, and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My first visit to the United States was in 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time a number of brothers came to me and expressed their concern for the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were concerned that this country would fall just as the Roman Empire fell, because of its decadent and luxuriant living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I told these brothers that this would not happen, because from the beginning all the worldly powers were invaders, invading others' countries to rob their people and take their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There has been only one country in all of human history that did not rob others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That country is the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The United States has the resources, and all these resources have been developed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The entire country has been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The United States has the territory, the resources, and a people who have been educated in high technology.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is difficult for such a country to collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, I must say that, according to my observation, the moral situation in this country is definitely declining.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I believe that the United States is the country that the Lord raised up for His recovery, the present situation of immorality in this country concerns me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>KNOWING THE LORD'S MIND AND HIS WAY TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though we may have the financial support, we do not have enough people to send to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we could now send twenty thousand, in a very short time we could have more than one thousand churches raised up in the cities of Russia, with each city having twenty serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everywhere among the three hundred million Russians, the people are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have a desire to know God and the Bible, and they are very open to Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we do not have a sufficient number of people to go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The denominations have a much larger number, but not many would go, because to go involves paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe that the recent political change in Russia was something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No human being could have caused such a thing to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since this was of the Lord, we need to consider what the Lord's mind and the Lord's way are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps the Lord's way is to gain the Russians who are open and train them for ten years and then send them back to the United States to re-evangelize this country.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We surely need to pray over and consider all these matters before the Lord.</S>
