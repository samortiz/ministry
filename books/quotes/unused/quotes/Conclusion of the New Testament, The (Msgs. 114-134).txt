The life of the believers is in three stages: the stage of creation, the stage of the fall, and the stage of God's salvation
As we consider our life as believers, we need to keep in mind that we have passed through the three stages of creation, fall, and salvation
God used the dust to form man's physical body, and then He breathed into that body the breath of life, which caused the body to become alive
In creation we have a created life, a human life, and a temporary life, not an uncreated life, a divine life, and an eternal life
The human life created by God does not have the life and nature of God; however, the created human life does bear the image of God
Because man was created in the image of God and the image of God is Christ, man was created in the image of Christ
In Genesis 1:26 God says, 'Let us make man in our image,' but verse 27 says, 'God created man in his own image'
Romans 5:14 says that Adam, the first man, was a 'type of the coming One,' that is a type, a figure, of Christ
As a photograph is the expression of a certain image, so man was made to be the expression of the image of God, which is Christ
It is a very significant matter that the created human life is a life bearing the image of God, and we need to consider this in more detail
For man to be created in the image of God means that he was made in such a way that he could become God's duplication
For God to create man in His image means that He created man with the capacity to have His love, light, righteousness, and holiness
God created man in His image in such a way that man has the ability to contain God's love, light, righteousness, and holiness
Human love, light, righteousness, and holiness are created capacities to contain the divine love, light, righteousness, and holiness
The point here is that man has these virtues because he was created in Gods image in the image of Gods love light righteousness and holiness
When Eve accepted the satanic proposal to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Satan's element entered her soul and polluted it
The first result of the fall was that the soul of man was contaminated through Eve's receiving the Devil's thought and word
God desires man for the accomplishment of His will, and Satan wants man for the fulfillment of his evil desire
God's intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life and thus obtain His uncreated life and be one with Him
When Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan's life entered into him, causing him to become corrupted
The Greek word translated 'dwells' actually means 'make a home,' for the verb has the root meaning of house or home
For this reason, it is no longer we who do the evil that we do not want to do, but sin that makes its home within us
Because every kind of life has its own law, the devilish life, the life of sin, also has its law-the law of sin and death
The law of sin in our members is always warring against this good law in our mind and making us captive to the law of sin
Now, in addition to our original created human life and the life of Satan obtained through the fall, we also have the life of God
The divine life does not come into us to replace the human life; rather, the divine life is mingled with the human life
The two laws in Romans 8:2-the law of sin and of death and the law of the Spirit of life-are principles, not commandments
It is this law, not God nor the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin and death
Our entire tripartite being-spirit, soul, and body-has been uplifted, having passed through the process of the resurrection of Christ
If we believe God, we should also believe His word which says that our life as believers has been uplifted in the resurrection of Christ
Not only is our life uplifted in Christ's resurrection; it is also transformed by the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit
Corinthians 3:18 says that we are transformed into the same image, the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ, from glory to glory
As we cooperate with the Lord, He will have a free way to transform our human life with the element of the divine life
The pneumatic Christ is not a spiritual Christ; the pneumatic Christ is the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit
Because of the influence of tradition, if we speak of Christ in the Spirit, others may think that Christ is separate from the Spirit
We have seen that as believers we have three different livesthe created life of man the fallen life of Satan and the uncreated life of God
Though we have all three lives within us, yet we obtain them at three different junctures due to three different occurrences
During the fall, due to our contact with Satan and the tree of knowledge of good and evil, we obtained the fallen life of Satan
At the time of our salvation, because we believed in the Son of God and received Him, we obtained the uncreated life of God
We have seen in the foregoing message that the believers' life is in three stages: God's creation, the fall, and God's salvation
In this message we shall consider the believers' nature in God's creation, in the fall, and in God's salvation
In Acts 17:28 Paul goes on to say, 'In Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we also are His offspring'
To say that Adam was a son of God does not mean that he was born of God and possessed the life and nature of God
Based upon this, he was supposed to be the son of God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God
There is no indication in the Bible that the offspring of God, the human beings produced by God, have the divine nature
All human beings are the offspring of God produced by Him, but the believers are the sons of God born of Him through regeneration
The body was then changed in nature, having the nature of the tree of knowledge, the element of Satan, injected into it, making it the flesh
As originally created by God, the human body was a pure vessel containing one element, the element created by God
As a result of man's eating of the fruit of knowledge, a foreign element was injected into man's body and transmuted it into the flesh
If we would be clear concerning the truth about our fallen human nature, we need to read Romans 7:18 very carefully
We are clearly told in Romans 7 that within us there is a will that desires to do good and that there is a law of good in our mind
Within us fallen human beings there is still the element of goodness and the law that naturally causes us to desire to do good
We need to realize that when Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, something evil, and even satanic, entered into him
In Matthew 23:33 He called them 'serpents, brood of vipers,' the offspring of the most poisonous kind of serpents
We need to realize that, in the sight of God, we in our fallen nature are serpents full of the poison of the Devil
We praise the Lord that, as believers in Christ, we have been brought into a third stage-the stage of God's salvation
According to Titus 3:5, the believers have a purified nature 'through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit'
Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
The divine nature is the nature of God's person, the nature of God's essence, and the nature of God's expression
Because the divine nature is dispensed into us for our enjoyment, we now have a nature mingled with the divine nature
In the believers the purified human nature and the divine nature are not separate but are mingled to form a compound nature
In New Testament Greek, words such as foreknow and foreknowledge imply more than what we would understand from the English translations
The foreknowledge of God spoken of in 1 Peter 1:2 implies that in eternity past God approved us and appreciated us
God's foreknowledge, therefore, means not only that He knew us in eternity past; it also means that He ordained us
He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love'
The fact that we were chosen in eternity means that our salvation began in eternity, that it began before creation and before time
We all need to thank God the Father for His eternal selection, the selection made in eternity past for eternity future
As believers in Christ, we are separated unto God by the redeeming blood of Christ , by the Holy Spirit , and in the name of the Lord Jesus
To be holy means not only to be separated unto God positionally but also to be saturated with God dispositionally
Separation can take place rather easily and in a very short time, but it takes a long time to be saturated with God dispositionally
God has chosen us to be so holy and so pure that we shall be without blemish, without any foreign particles, having only the divine element
We shall be holy and without blemish not according to our standard or in our own sight, but according to God's standard and in His sight
Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand
God first selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny
The reason we came to believe in Christ is that we were predestinated, marked out beforehand, by God the Father
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
For man to be created in God's image, which is Christ, means that we were created not only through Christ but according to Christ
Romans 512 says As through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin and so death passed to all men because all have sinned
Ephesians 2:1 reveals that in the past we were dead in our offenses and sins, and 2:5 says that 'we were dead in offenses'
The word 'dead' in Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13 refers to the death of our spirit that pervades our entire being
The One who foreknew us, chose us, and predestinated us before the foundation of the world, one day came to visit us
He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers'
We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's Son that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers
When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique, but God desired to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son
God's house is built up with His many sons for His kingdom, and the Body of Christ is built up with His many brothers
Without the many sons God cannot have a house for His kingdom, and without the many brothers Christ cannot have a Body
The many sons of God are for the house of God and then for the kingdom of God, and the many brothers of Christ are for the Body of Christ
Grace is not mainly the work God does for us; grace is the Triune God Himself dispensed into our being and experienced as our enjoyment
According to the New Testament, grace is nothing less than God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment
Because this grace was manifested through the appearing of Christ, the Old Testament saints did not experience it
Virtue denotes the energy of life to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all the excellent attributes listed in 2 Peter 1:5-7
We need to be impressed with the fact that in 2 Peter 1:3b virtue denotes the energy and strength of life for reaching God's goal
We can reach this goal only by the divine life and by all things pertaining to the divine life that have been given to us by God
Whoever would listen to and believe in the gospel receives God's calling, which is the initiation of God's full salvation
The heavenly calling is a calling to possess the allinclusive Christ the embodiment of the processed Triune God as our life and inheritance
Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory, and 1 Timothy 1:1 speaks of Jesus Christ being our hope
We have the one hope the hope that one day the Lord Jesus will come as our hope of glory and that through Him our body will be transfigured
According to Colossians 3:4, when Christ our life is manifested, we also shall be manifested with Him in glory
The Triune God's reality is what the Triune God is, that is, the unsearchable riches and immeasurable dimensions of Christ
God is glorified in the church , Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ, which include all that Christ is to us
In the church God is expressed corporately through the Body, through the believers who have been filled with the Triune God's reality
The calling with which God has called us is worthy of the walk in the Body of Christ, the corporate expression of the Triune God
To be called into the fellowship of God's Son actually means to be called into the participation and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ
God has called us into such a fellowship that we may partake of Christ, participate in Him, and enjoy Him as our God-given portion
The mutuality of this fellowship is not only between the believers and the Triune God but also among the believers themselves
It is the fellowship of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ, the One who in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit
In the New Testament, fellowship describes the flowing both between us and the Lord and between us and one another
There is a flow, a current, vertically between us and the Father and Son and horizontally between us and other believers
Because we have been called into such a fellowship, we should not say that we are of a certain person, doctrine, or practice
For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps'
As the context indicates, some of the believers to whom this Epistle was written were called to suffer unjustly under crooked masters
We have been called to unjust suffering so that in it we may have the enjoyment of God as grace and express Him
Literally the Greek word for model means a writing copy an underwriting for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them
The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing and following His steps
Colossians 3:15 says, 'Let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body'
Our having been called to the peace of Christ should also motivate us to let this peace arbitrate in our hearts
With Christ as our Peacemaker, we have vertical peace-peace between us and God-and horizontal peace-peace with one another
He is the peace that carries on a work of arbitration within us to keep us at peace with God and with one another for His one Body
Paul says, 'To which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ'
The words 'to which' refer to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, as mentioned in verse 13
Salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth are the procedures; obtaining the glory of our Lord is the goal
The glory of the Lord is that He is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father's life and nature to express Him
In 2 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul does not say that God has called us unto the obtaining of forgiveness, justification, or reconciliation
The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and nature to express the Father in His fullness
God has called us unto the obtaining of this glory, the glory of the divine life and the divine nature to express the divine Being
The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us, as indicated by the words 'called you into His eternal glory'
In all these divine acts the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences
Thessalonians 2:12 does not say that God has called us to heaven, but says that He has called us with the goal of entering into His kingdom
We need to have a Christian walk that will enable us to enter into the kingdom of God, a walk that will usher us into God's glory
The expression 'called saints' indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called to be saints
Because we have been called by God unto His purpose, separated unto Him for the fulfillment of His eternal plan, we are the called saints
In this message we shall see that, as part of their present, the believers have been sanctified by the Spirit and that they have repented
The sequence is this: God's selection, the Spirit's sanctification, justification, and subjective sanctification
The lamp signifies the word of God used by the Spirit to enlighten and expose the sinner's position and condition so that he may repent
The Spirit's seeking here is inside the sinner, carried out by the Spirit's working within the repenting sinner
The Spirit opens the believers' eyes and turns them from darkness to light that they may see the divine things in the spiritual realm
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
To be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God's kingdom belonging to light
Sin entered through Adam , righteousness is the resurrected Christ , and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin
Those who do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ will remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity
Whereas those who believe in Christ receive Him as their righteousness, those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan
One day the Spirit came to us to separate us unto God by convicting us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment
The prodigal son's waking up was due to the enlightening of the Holy Spirit signified by the woman with the lamp
The believers have had a change of mind, a turn in their mind from the things other than God to God and His kingdom
As used in these verses, the word 'repent' literally means to think differently afterward, that is, to have a change of mind
On the positive side, to repent is to turn to God in every way and in every thing for fulfilling His purpose in creating mankind
When we repented, we had not only a change of our mind but also a turn in our mind from everything other than God to God and His kingdom
Our mentality, logic, and philosophy governed our way of life, for we were under the direction of our fallen mind
One day we heard the preaching of the gospel telling us to repent, to have a change and a turn in our thinking, philosophy, and logic
In Matthew 3:2 and 4:17 John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus did not tell people to repent so that they may go to heaven or obtain salvation
When we heard the preaching of the gospel, we turned to God's kingdom, to God's rule, and now we are in the kingdom of God
We have turned from all things other than God to God and His kingdom, placing ourselves under His ruling so that we may be in His kingdom
The believers at Thessalonica made such a turn and Paul said to them, 'You turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God'
Based upon it, the blessing of God's full salvation goes forth and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit
We see that the genuine forgiveness of sins comes through the opening of the eyes and the transfer from Satan to God
To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people required Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior
Repentance and forgiveness of sins are major gifts, and only the Lord Jesus as the Leader and the Savior is qualified to give them
Following God's calling, the Holy Spirit came to separate us, enlightening us and convicting us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment
Enlightening and convicting are the work of the Holy Spirit to separate us unto God in the initial stage of our salvation
We have received Him who is the Word, the very God, and the true light; that is, we have believed into His name, which denotes His person
Verse 12 goes on to say, 'As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name'
The Greek preposition for 'in' here actually means 'into' and signifies union with Christ by believing into Him
The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives us the eternal life which is in the Son
These verses speak of having eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, by believing into the Son of Man
The Greek word rendered 'that' at the beginning of John 3:15 is better translated 'so that' or 'in order that'
The issue of our believing into Christ as the Son of God and the Son of Man is that we have an organic union with Him
By believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through accomplished obtained and attained
Acts 13:39 says, 'From all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified'
As the Lord Jesus is infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, we spontaneously appreciate Him and call on Him
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we had this kind of experience, although we did not have the terminology to explain it
The organic union with Christ is accomplished spontaneously through the living faith produced by our appreciation of Him
Although we are justified with the righteousness of God, we, the justified ones, actually have Christ as our righteousness
In Romans 1:17 Paul, speaking of the gospel, says, 'The righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith'
According to John 3:16 salvation is out of God's love, and according to Ephesians 2:8, salvation is by God's grace
With the righteousness of God we, the believers in Christ, have been justified through our believing into Christ
Mark 16:16 says, 'He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned'
He works for God by the life of God so that by believing in Him we may have the life of God to become children of God
We must believe that He is the One who is the divine Person coming to carry out God's commission for His eternal purpose
After we consider these matters, we should have an accurate and thorough description of our believing in Christ
With the heart we believe that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead , and with the heart we believe 'unto righteousness'
With the heart we believe the fact that God has raised Christ from among the dead, and this kind of believing results in righteousness
Our believing is not only with the heart but also with the mouth confessing the Lord Jesus and calling upon His name unto salvation
Romans 10:9 and 10 reveal clearly that believing is an activity with two aspects, an inward aspect and an outward aspect
The inward aspect is to believe in our heart the fact that Jesus Christ was raised up from among the dead by God
Romans 10:12 and 13 say, 'There is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him
Although it is possible to pray to the Lord silently, calling on the Lord requires that we call out to Him or address Him audibly
We have a mouth to call on Him that we may be filled with Him, and we have a heart to believe in Him and to retain Him
Ephesians 2:8 says, 'By grace you have been saved through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God'
Ephesians 2:8 indicates that faith is not of our works, nor of our endeavor or strife; rather, faith is God's gift, that no one should boast
At the time we repented and made confession to God in the name of the Lord Jesus, the believing ability was put into us
God forms the gift of faith and gives it to us through the divine revelation of the word of truth in the New Testament
Especially the book of Revelation, as the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the whole Bible, is 'the revelation of Jesus Christ'
Through the preaching of the gospel, the all-inclusive Christ in His all-inclusive person and work was presented as scenery to our view
As this speaking was taking place, a revelation came to us conveying the all-inclusive Christ as the scenery for us to view
Through the hearing of the word of the divine revelation , the seeing of the divine scenery is generated by the Spirit within the believers
We heard the preaching of the gospel, there was a 'click' of the 'shutter' of the 'camera,' and the light came into us
In this way He becomes their faith in Him and thus the Author of their faith , a faith that is called the faith of Christ
At a certain point there was a 'click,' and the Spirit, the heavenly light, generated a seeing of the scenery within us
When the pneumatic Christ was revealed in us through the preaching of the gospel, He became the believing element and ability within us
In this way we believed in Him, having received the gift of faith through the hearing of the word and the seeing of the divine scenery
As long as we have this gift, we have the lot of God's inheritance, for living faith equals the lot of God's inheritance
The good land, the portion of the children of Israel in Old Testament times, typifies the all-inclusive Christ
As the good land was the portion of the Old Testament saints, so Christ is the portion of the New Testament believers
In the Old Testament the good land was allotted to the twelve tribes, and in the New Testament precious faith is allotted to us
If Christ were merely Christ to us and not also faith, we would not be able to participate in Him or share in Him
In 1:1 Peter considers faith not a means but an allotment, a portion of the New Testament inheritance allotted to us by God
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that faith in 2 Peter 1:1 is equal to the New Testament inheritance
The issue of the faith produced within us is that whatever Christ is according to the word of the New Testament is imparted to us
When in our experience our response and the Christ conveyed to us through the preaching of the Word become one, faith is produced within us
Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth , which is the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy
Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it
It brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all with itself subjective to us in our experience
When the light brings the scenery to the film within the camera, both the seeing and scenery become subjective to it
Galatians 3:24 says, 'So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith'
In John 16:9 we are told that the Spirit will convict the world concerning sin because of not believing in the Son of God
Verse 23 says, 'Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed'
In the case of Philip preaching the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch , we have the case of a genuine Gentile believing in the Lord
If Philip had not said anything about baptism, it is unlikely that the Ethiopian would have reacted in this way
Philip may still have been talking about water baptism when they came to the water in which the eunuch was baptized
Speaking of Lydia whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things spoken by Paul we are told that she was baptized and her household
Taking them with him in that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes; and he was baptized immediately, he and all his household'
To be baptized is to be baptized into the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit into an organic union with the processed Triune God
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the history of the baptized ones
To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to baptize them into spiritual and mystical union with Him
To baptize believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is in fact to baptize them into the processed Triune God
To baptize believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is to baptize them both in the water and in the Spirit
Physically, we baptize believers in water, yet the water symbolizes the divine name, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
When we put people into the water of baptism, we put them into the person of the Triune God so that they may have an organic union with Him
Apparently, these believers were not baptized into the name of the Triune God but into the name of the Lord Jesus
Today, when we baptize believers into the name of the Lord Jesus we are actually baptizing them into the Triune God
In the book of Acts we see that the believers are baptized not only into the name of the Lord Jesus but also in the name of Jesus Christ
To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is to be baptized into the Triune God to have an organic union with Him
To be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized in Christ as a sphere, the sphere of the name of Jesus Christ
The water symbolizes the spiritual and divine reality which is the Triune God embodied in the all-inclusive Christ
Actually we are not baptizing them in water, for the water is a symbol of the reality in the name, the person, of Jesus Christ
To be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for
Eis, into , signifies a spiritual union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
The person of Jesus Christ is not only the sphere in which we are baptized but also the ground, the standing, upon which we are baptized
By both faith and baptism, we have been immersed into Christ, having thus put on Christ and having become identified with Christ
When a person is baptized into Christ, he enters into an organic union, which is able to transform his whole being
How could we be baptized into Christ if, according to the traditional teaching of the Trinity, He were only sitting in the heavens?
Immediately after we have been put into Christ and have entered into an organic union with Him, we need to live Christ
Baptism is an act in which we put the members of Adam into the death of Christ, thereby transferring them out of Adam and into Christ
Through identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ
In Romans 6:3 Paul says, 'Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
On the one hand, we have been baptized into Christ's person; on the other hand, we have been baptized into Christ's death
It is significant that in 6:3 Paul says that we have been baptized not into Christ's resurrection but into His death
Paul introduces the thought of burial; he says that with Christ we have been buried through baptism into death
The believers have also been baptized into the Body of Christ into one organic entity with Christ as its life and constituent to express Him
In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit'
Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ
Today certain believers talk a great deal about the baptism in the Spirit but not nearly as much about being baptized into the Body
Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ
We praise the Lord that we have been baptized into the organic entity of the Body of Christ for His expression
In Acts 1:5 the Lord Jesus says, 'John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now'
Verse 47 says, 'Can anyone forbid water that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit even as we'?
Water is the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation
Baptism in water and in the Holy Spirit is typified by the sea and the cloud of the baptism in which the children of Israel were baptized
Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh-the dirt of our fallen nature and defilement of fleshly lust
Peter's thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God
After we have been baptized and rise up out of the water, we have a conscience that is good and pure, a conscience without condemnation
Apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we could not have resurrection life, and we could not have the life-giving Spirit within us
It is through the resurrection of Christ that we are brought into the Triune God to have an organic union with Him
It is through the resurrection of Christ that we genuinely and with assurance experience the reality of what is figured in baptism
A proper baptism will always bring the baptized one into a situation of appealing to God for a conscience that is good and pure
Both toward God and toward man we have had many transgressions, trespasses and offenses, and we had a great deal of guilt
Matthew 28:19 indicates that the believers are baptized into the name, the person, of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
John 13:3 says, 'Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God'
In John 8:42 the Lord Jesus says, 'I came forth out of God and am come from Him,' and in 16:28 He says, 'I came forth out of the Father'
Corinthians 2:12 speaks of 'the Spirit which is from God,' and John 15:26 reveals that the Spirit of reality proceeds from the Father
In order for the believers to be joined to God the Father, it was necessary for them to be born of God as the begetting Father
John 1:13 speaks of the believers as those 'who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God'
As those who are joined to the processed Triune God, we are joined to God the Son, Christ, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God
God the Father is the source, the origin, of the Trinity, and God the Son is the embodiment of the processed Trinity
The illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ's gospel known to us issues from God's shining Christ into our hearts
If we do not receive Christ continually, we shall not enjoy the full benefit of the Christ we have received initially
God's heart's desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life , and become the sons of God
It is significant that in Galatians 1:15 and 16 Paul does not say that God revealed Christ in him, but says that He revealed His Son in him
The reason for this difference is that whenever we speak of the Son of God, we are immediately involved with the Father and the Spirit
God has transferred us out of Adam into Christ through Christ's crucifixion and resurrection and by our believing and being baptized
Galatians 2:20a says that we have been crucified with Christ, and Colossians 2:20a, that we have died with Him
We should pray that the Lord will give us a clear vision of the glorious fact that we are in Christ and that we have been crucified with Him
As sinners we need God's forgiveness and justification, but as those who are dead in offenses and sins we need to be made alive
God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself , into our deadened spirit through His Spirit of life
Colossians 2:13a says, 'You, being dead in the offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him'
We who once were dead in offenses and in the uncircumcision of the flesh have been made alive together with Christ
Romans 6:4b says, 'As Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life'
The word 'heavenlies' refers not only to a place but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic
In Christ, God has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic
The believers have been joined to the Son of God by being grafted into Him as the reality of the cultivated olive tree
Through the organic union of two trees, accomplished by grafting, the one tree partakes of the life and characteristics of the other tree
The believers, as partners of Christ sharing His anointing , have been attached to Him as God's anointed One by God
God attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, connecting the apostles and the believers to Christ, the anointed One
The one spirit in 1 Corinthians 6:17 is the mingled spirit, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit
We love Him whom we have not seen because of believing, because of the faith that has been infused into us through hearing the living word
As a result of all these matters, we have been joined to God the Son, the embodiment of the divine Trinity, and now we are in Him
Now we need to see that we have also been joined to God the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God
The Spirit enters into the believers and lives in them through their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ
According to the New Testament, especially Paul's Epistles, the Spirit we have received is the processed Triune God
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
Apart from the Spirit of reality, in our experience we cannot have the divine Trinity or any of the divine attributes
Because the Spirit is the reality of God, the Son, eternal life, and every divine matter, He is called the Spirit of reality
In God's economy Christ has been anointed to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest
John 2:20 says, 'You have an anointing from the Holy One,' and verse 27 says, 'The anointing which you received from Him abides in you'
As we are under the Spirit's anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing which causes us to bear the image of God
The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge, and the pledge is a guarantee that the Triune God is our inheritance
The pledge of the Spirit is not merely a once-for-all matter, because the Spirit is continually pledging within us
The Spirit's anointing, sealing, and pledging all involve the dispensing of the processed Triune God into our being
The processed Triune God is the full taste, and He has given us the Spirit as the firstfruit to be our foretaste
The blessing of the New Testament gospel, therefore, is not going to heaven, and it is not merely the forgiveness of sins and eternal life
The blessing of the gospel is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God
On the one hand, we have received the Spirit into us essentially; on the other hand, we have been baptized in Him economically
In Acts 1:5b the Lord said to the disciples, 'You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now'
Whereas receiving the Spirit essentially is for living, being baptized in the Spirit economically is for ministry
The essential Spirit of life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of power is for carrying out Christ's commission
The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord's resurrection to be the Spirit of life in them essentially
Acts 19:6 tells us that when Paul laid his hands on certain believers in Ephesus, 'the Holy Spirit came upon them'
For this reason, some Bible teachers have called the Spirit of power the 'mantle Spirit,' the Spirit as an outer coat
The Spirit of life and the Spirit of power, the mantle Spirit, are two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience
On the one hand, we have all been baptized in one Spirit; on the other hand, we have all been given to drink of the one Spirit
The inward aspect of the Spirit is for life essentially, and the outward aspect of the Spirit is for ministry and work economically
Through these two aspects of the one Spirit the believers have been joined to God the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God
In this message and in the one previous, we have seen that the believers in Christ have been joined to the processed Triune God
We are one with the Father as the source, with the Son as the embodiment, and with the Spirit as the consummation
May we all see the marvelous fact that we have been joined to the processed Triune God and now are one with Him
The word 'redeemed' is an example of a biblical term that has become religious because of the way it is commonly used
Many requirements were laid upon us-the demands of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory-and it was impossible for us to fulfill them
According to most other references in Scripture the blood of Christ redeems us from sins transgressions lawlessness and all sinful things
Chapter one of 1 Peter emphasizes the holy manner of life which God's chosen people should have in their sojourn
Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we pass the days of our sojourning in fear
It includes the forgiveness of our sins and our being freed, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God
A certain aspect of sanctification precedes justification, whereas other aspects of sanctification follow justification
When God called us through the preaching of the gospel, the Holy Spirit worked on us in such a way that we repented
Rather, we should say that redemption includes forgiveness, for redemption, and not forgiveness, is an all-inclusive matter
In the same principle, our being freed, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God are also included in Christ's redemption
He who was called in the Lord when a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise, he who was called when free is Christ's slave
As those who have been bought by God, the believers inwardly should be slaves only of Christ; they should not become slaves of men
The believers were bought not only to be the slaves of Christ but also to be the possession, the inheritance, of God
We, God's redeemed ones, the church, are God's possession acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ
Revelation 5:9 says, 'You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation'
The blood of Christ is able to redeem us from under the law so that the law will no longer confine us under condemnation
Because the blood of Christ redeems us from the condemnation of the law, it also abolishes the distance between us and God
Redemption is what Christ accomplished for our offenses, and forgiveness is what Christ accomplished applied to our offenses
We have pointed out that the forgiveness of offenses is the redemption accomplished through the blood of Christ
The last of the contents of the new covenant is propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and forgiveness of our sins
Christ made propitiation for our sins to appease God's righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of God's righteousness
In eternity the Father will be able to declare that He has many sons who have never sinned, for in His memory there is no such thing as sin
The propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and the forgetting of our sins give Him the ground to impart His life into us
God's original intention for His eternal purpose was to impart His life into man, but sin came in to frustrate this
Without the shed blood of Jesus, God's righteous requirement could never have been satisfied, and man's sins could never have been forgiven
Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God's righteousness that the new covenant may be enacted
In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings
The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion
The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God
On the positive side, to repent is to turn to God in every way and in everything for the fulfilling of His purpose in making man
To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior
On God's side, forgiveness of sins is based upon His redemption; on man's side, forgiveness is through repentance
In Luke 2447 the Lord Jesus told the disciples that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations
To preach the gospel is to proclaim the forgiveness of God through the redeeming blood of Christ by the believers' repentance and faith
According to the New Testament, the forgiveness of sins proclaimed in the gospel ushers the forgiven ones into the riches of the Triune God
In the foregoing message we saw that the believers have been redeemed by being bought and by being forgiven of their sins
As sinners, descendants of Adam, we have already been judged and thus are under God's condemnation and even His sentence
Because God loves mankind, He laid our sins on His Son, who died on the cross as our substitute to be judged by God
Those who do not believe in Him remain under God's condemnation and can only wait for eternal judgment and perdition
No matter whether we are good or evil, we all, as a part of Adam, were under God's judgment before we believed in Christ
God did not send the Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him'
We see that Christ, the Son of God, was sent to save us from God's condemnation, which was brought in by the sin of Adam
Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law
Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law
Those who do not believe in Him will remain under the wrath of God, which is like mighty thunder ready to roll
Because the Lord has destroyed the Devil and abolished death , we now have no more fear of death and are released from its slavery
We have been released by Christ from the slavery of sin, from the slavery of the fear of death, and even from the slavery of death itself
Revelation 1:5 speaks of the Lord Jesus as the One 'who loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood'
The conscience is the leading part of our spirit, and the living God always comes to our spirit by touching our conscience
Because we have been defiled by sins outwardly and by our old nature inwardly, we need both a positional and dispositional washing
These two kinds of defilement require two kinds of cleansing, or one cleansing with both the positional and dispositional aspects
Washing is not by the blood in an objective way, for this is the subjective washing of regeneration as in Titus 3:5
In the New Testament 'in the name of the Lord' actually means in the Lord Himself, for the name denotes the person
Because the Lord is a living person, not merely a name, whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we call on His person
At the time we were saved, we probably called on the Lord's name spontaneously and unconsciously, without being taught to do this
Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John indicate that the Lord's name cannot be separated from the Spirit
If we continue to call on the name of the Lord, enjoying His name and His Spirit, we shall daily experience a dispositional washing
The cleansing of man's heart can only be by the Holy Spirit with the divine life, not by outward ordinances by dead letters
The sanctification revealed in the New Testament includes dispositional transformation in addition to positional change
Through dispositional sanctification the believers are being transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one
Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers'
Within Him there is a holy nature, and this holy nature is also within us, for He and we are of the same Father, the same source
Now we are sanctified not only in Christ but also in the Spirit, that is, in the power and realization of the Holy Spirit
In this message we shall see that, as redeemed ones, the believers have been justified and then reconciled to God in the first step
Grace is something freely given of God or done by God, and it is the expression and manifestation of God's love
God's love caused Him to have grace on us, and His righteousness caused Him to accomplish redemption for us through Christ
Our being justified is a matter both of God's grace bestowed on us and God's righteousness accomplished for us
Just as a child needs to eat the food prepared by his mother, so we need to receive all that God has prepared for our justification
Verse 30 says, 'Since it is one God who shall justify the circumcision out of faith and uncircumcision through faith'
The faith of Christ is actually Christ Himself, the One who has entered into the believing ones to be their believing element and ability
Acts 13:39 says, 'From all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified'
Although we are justified with the righteousness of God and have received this righteousness, we actually have Christ as our righteousness
Romans 4:25 says that Christ 'was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification'
The death of Christ fully satisfied God's righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through Christ's death
His resurrection is an evidence that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death
If this were the situation, we could not believe that His death was accepted by God and that it satisfied God's righteous requirements
You may be surprised to know that not one word in the Scriptures says that we ought to believe that the Lord has died for us
Justification includes the fact that God has resurrected Christ, accepted Him, and that God has been satisfied with His redemptive death
Father God, Thou hast accepted Jesus as our Substitute; Judged the Just One for the unjust, Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice, At Thine own right hand He sits; He, as Thy full satisfaction, Righteously Thy need befits'
The ascended Christ, who sits at the right hand of God, is an evidence that we, the believers in Christ, have been justified by God
Because we have been justified objectively, we have been brought up to the standard of God's righteousness and now we correspond to it
As the resurrected One, Christ is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God
The resurrected Christ is now living in us a life that is absolutely righteous, a life that can be justified by God
Now God is positioned by Christ's blood to justify us outwardly, and He is also positioned by the resurrected Christ to justify us inwardly
The Spirit dispenses His essence into us and thereby justifies us, makes us acceptable to God, dispositionally
Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself
In verse 20 it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God, who are to be reconciled further to Him
The second step is that, as believers living in the natural life, we need to be reconciled to God from the flesh
In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God so that we may become the righteousness of God in Him
A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing the screen
Many believers have been reconciled to God in the first step, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place
Because of the need for believers to have the second step of reconciliation, Paul, in 2 Corinthians 5:20, says, 'Be reconciled to God'
In this message we shall be concerned only with being reconciled to God in the first step, leaving the second step for a later message
We were reconciled to God in the first step through the death of God's Son as the propitiation for the believers' sins
John 2:2 says, 'He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world'
The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins , not only for our redemption but also for God's satisfaction
Herein lies the difference between propitiation and reconciliation: propitiation is for sins; reconciliation is both for sins and enmity
On the one hand, we have been reconciled to God; on the other hand, we still need to be saved in the life of God's Son
Rather, this is an expression conveying the plain and real fact that we have been saved to be made a new creation
In the old creation God did not create millions of men; on the contrary, He created one man, Adam, who includes all men
Through God's redemption, regeneration, and dispensing of Himself into us, we who once were sons of Adam have now become sons of God
God's life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature
Although the old creation came into being through the work of the mighty God, He Himself does not reside in it
We can receive the divine life and nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit
Corinthians 5:17 says, 'If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new'
The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ's resurrection
The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does
The believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
The old creation is our old man in Adam , our natural being by birth, without God's life and the divine nature
Whereas circumcision is an ordinance of the law, the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature
The new creation spoken of in Galatians 6:15 is the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God
Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation
Since we are made a new creation by being regenerated, we need a clear and accurate understanding of regeneration
God's purpose is that we obtain His uncreated life and be transformed by this life into His image to be like Him
By regenerating us, God the Father enlivens us with His life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with Him
The fact that God purposed means that He brought us forth of His own will, by His intention, to carry out His purpose by begetting us
Peter 1:3a says, 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us'
According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace and eligible only to receive His mercy
Peter 1:3 reveals that our regeneration took place 'through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead'
In the sight of God, we were regenerated before we were born, since Christ's resurrection was our regeneration
Before we became part of the old creation through our natural birth we were already a part of the new creation through Christs resurrection
Our experience of regeneration is based fully upon the fact that it has already been accomplished through the resurrection of Christ
In His resurrection Christ imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and in nature
Water is the central sign of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to bury and terminate people of the old creation
The center of the ministry of the Lord Jesus is the Spirit, that is, to germinate people with a new life in the new creation
Whenever a person repents, confessing that he is a sinner who is good only for burial, he is accepting John's ministry
In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation
On the negative side, the water terminates us; on the positive side, the Spirit germinates us, thereby generating the new man
In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
The Lord spoke this word in reply to what Nicodemus had said in verse 4: 'How can a man be born when he is old?
All our experiences of spiritual life are matters of the new man, who begins within us at the time of our regeneration
A regenerated person, a person born of the Spirit, is like the wind, which can be realized but which is beyond understanding
Regeneration, that is, receiving the divine life, is a matter that takes place in our spirit, not in our body or soul
Our spirit was made by God for the purpose that one day we would exercise it to contact Him and receive Him into our being
Spirit, our regenerated spirit, is our spiritual man, our new man, our inward or inner man , born of God, who is Spirit
By regeneration the divine life was imparted to our spirit by the Spirit of God, and our spirit was made alive, regenerated
The believers have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God, the word of the divine reality, as the incorruptible seed
Peter 1:23 says, 'Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
To be regenerated is to be born of God, and to be born of God is to have the life of God, that is, the eternal life
It is the greatest wonder in the universe that human beings can be begotten of God and that sinners can be made children of God
Just as this is a fixed principle in physical life, it is even more solid and substantial in the spiritual realm
James 1:18 says, 'Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures'
God's new creation is organic, altogether a matter of life, and the regenerated believers are the firstfruit of this new creation
With one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living
When we were sprinkled with the blood of Christ , immediately the life-giving Spirit came into us to enliven us
Formerly we were dead and altogether without hope, but we have been 'lifed' through the life-giving Spirit unto a living hope
We do not know to what extent the divine life within us will develop, but we have a living hope concerning this
The believers in Christ are made a new creation not only by being regenerated but also by receiving the Spirit of God
Regarding the Spirit of God, we need to realize that the Spirit of God is actually God Himself reaching us and being applied to us
Galatians 3:2 speaks of receiving the Spirit: 'Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith'?
The One who was crucified for us was Christ, but the One who enters us is the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
As believers, we have received the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel
To receive the essential Spirit is to receive the Spirit as life for our spiritual being, existence, and living
God gives the Spirit to us not only as a pledge of our inheritance but also a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God
The pledging of the Spirit, which is given to us for our enjoyment and encouragement involves the dispensing of the Spirit into us
The Spirit of God in Romans 8:9 is not the same as the Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2, where He was brooding upon the face of the waters
The Spirit of God in Romans 8:9 now dwells in the tripartite man and is now the Spirit of Christ, who possesses humanity as well as divinity
In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God had not yet gone through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Because the Holy Spirit is in our spirit and our spirit is within our body our body has become a temple a dwelling place of the Holy Spirit
The all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is fully realized as the Spirit who dwells within us
The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit
After the Spirit has brought us to salvation and has regenerated us, He will become in us the very reality of the Son Himself
Whatever the Son is, has, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained will all be fully wrought into us through the Spirit
The Spirit of reality does not guide the believers into the doctrine concerning Christ; the Spirit guides them into reality
We have seen that the believers have been made a new creation by being regenerated and by receiving the Spirit of God
Eternal life is neither temporary nor limited; rather, it is everlasting with respect to time and unlimited with respect to space
In the beginning' traces back to eternity past before creation, whereas 'from the beginning' proceeds forward from creation
The eternal life was not only with the Father, but was living and acting in union and communion with the Father in eternity
The life was manifested and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us
The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son
When we receive the Word, we receive God's content as life and are thereby born of God and become the children of God
To believe Him means to believe that He is true and real, but to believe into Him means to receive Him and be united with Him as one
It is by faith, by believing in the Lord Jesus, that we receive eternal life, the life of God, for our regeneration
Now, in resurrection, He is the Spirit of life, with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe in Him
Once we believe in Him, we receive the Spirit of life, that is, the Lord Himself, with the eternal life of God
It is by believing in the Lord with His all-inclusive work that we receive eternal life, God's life, and are born of Him to be His children
John 5:13 says, 'I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God'
The written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers who believe in the name of the Son of God that they have eternal life
Our believing to receive eternal life is the fact; the words of the Holy Writings are the assurance concerning this fact
We are assured and have the pledge by them that because we believe in the name of the Son of God we have eternal life
We not only have the fact of eternal life; we also have the pledge, the guarantee, the title deed, to prove that we have eternal life
Both the Son's hand as the hand of power and the Father's hand as the hand of love are for the believers' protection
Not only do we have eternal life, but we have two hands- the Son's hand of power and the Father's hand of love
To say that once we are saved we can be lost again means that the eternal life which has been given to us can be called back
It is absolutely correct that God has chosen us and predestinated us for eternal salvation and that our salvation cannot be lost
Otherwise, during the coming kingdom age we shall have dispensational punishment instead of dispensational reward
In this message we shall see that the believers are made a new creation also by being renewed and by being transferred
As believers in Christ, we have had a new birth, we have received the Spirit, who is always new, and we have a new life
In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of the new creation
Both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are a continual working in us until the completion of the new creation
The renewing that is by the Holy Spirit and related to the washing of regeneration is to make the believers a new creation
In the new creation, however, God's life and nature are wrought into man to make divinity one entity with humanity
Ephesians 2:15, referring to the Jews and the Gentiles, tells us that Christ created 'the two in Himself into one new man'
We all need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we, the believers, have been created into one new man in Christ
Christ's death on the cross was not only for the accomplishment of redemption but also for the creation of the one new man
By abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances, Christ broke down 'the middle wall of partition, the enmity'
Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
We, the believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ but also in the Body of Christ
After man was created he was put before two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil which is related to death
To be regenerated actually means to receive the tree of life, from which mankind was cut off through Adam's fall
Death is of the Devil, God's enemy Satan, signified by the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which brings death
Death and life are not only of these two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres
Acts 26:18 speaks of being turned from darkness to light, and 1 Peter 2:9, of being called out of darkness into God's marvelous light
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
To be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God's kingdom belonging to light
To be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the Devil, who has the might of death
We have been delivered from the Devil, Satan, by the death of Christ and by the life of Christ in resurrection
We have been not only delivered out of the authority of darkness but also transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God's love
The object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection
To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us
When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father's love
Under the heavenly ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom, the proper freedom in love, with life, and under light
The law makes demands upon man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet God's demands
Grace is not mainly the work God does for us; grace is the Triune God dispensed into us and experienced by us as our enjoyment
Galatians 1:4 says that Christ 'gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age'
Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to rescue us out of the present evil age
In John 10 we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture
Eventually, Christ came as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of the fold to the pasture, where they may feed on His riches
The transfer that has been accomplished concerning us includes the matter of being transferred out of the religious fold into the one flock
To be saved this way implies to be saved from God's condemnation and eternal perdition unto God's eternal purpose and His pleasure
Matthew 1:21 says, 'She will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins'
Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Joshua , which means Jehovah the Savior, or, the salvation of Jehovah
Now when we call on the name of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the life-giving Spirit operates within us
In John 8:32 the Lord Jesus says, 'The reality shall set you free,' and in verse 36 He says, 'The Son shall set you free'
Now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life'
Christ was born under law in order to redeem them from its custody that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God
God's economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose
Because the law was given to the old man , who is the old husband, and because the old man died on the cross, we are discharged from his law
Galatians 5:1 says, 'For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore and do not be again entangled with a yoke of slavery'
Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom and grace
Because Christ has set us free for freedom, we should stand fast and not be entangled again with the yoke of slavery
Whereas the law could not give life, the Spirit gives life and brings us into maturity that we may have the full position and right of sons
Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations
Freedom in Christ involves liberation from obligation satisfaction through the Lords rich supply genuine rest and the enjoyment of Christ
Because those who have this kind of freedom are free in the depths of their being, they are released from the bondage of law
The believers are also freed from the labor and burden under the law and religion or under any work and responsibility
It refers in particular to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations
In the books of Galatians and Colossians we see that the believers have been freed from the religious world and its elements
Galatians 1:4 says that Christ 'gave Himself for our sins, that He might, rescue us out of the present evil age'
We should be able to say that the religious world has been crucified to us and that we have been crucified to the religious world
We should be able to testify that even if we tried to go back to that world, we would be rejected by it, for we have been crucified to it
Christ's redemption and the Spirit's sanctification are for this- to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers
He brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted, having believed in God with all his household'
We see that being saved involves the inward matter of believing in our heart and the outward matter of confessing with our mouth
In Titus 3:4 and 5 Paul says that 'the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared' and that 'according to His mercy, He saved us'
The Father planned the Son accomplished the Fathers plan and the Spirit applies what the Son has accomplished according to the Fathers plan
These parables unveil and depict how the divine Trinity works to bring sinners back through the Son by the Spirit to the Father
Clearly, the shepherd refers to the Son, the woman refers to the Spirit, and the father refers to the heavenly Father
All three parables emphasize the love of the divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner
In Luke we first have the Son as the shepherd, then the Spirit as the woman, and finally the Father as the father receiving his returned son
God's calling is according to His predestination and purpose, through His own glory and virtue, in Christ, and through the gospel
Galatians 3:13 declares, 'Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf'
Christ has saved us from our sins , having 'carried up our sins in His body onto the tree' and dying for our sins
As believers, we are saved from the fear and slavery of death, Satan, the oppression of Satan, the authority of Satan, and darkness
Because Christ has destroyed the Devil who has the might of death, He has saved us from the fear and slavery of death
We have also been turned from darkness to light having been transferred out of Satans deathrealm of darkness into Gods liferealm of light
In Galatians 1:4 we see that the Lord Jesus 'gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age'
According to the context of the book of Galatians and as confirmed by Galatians 6:14-15, the present evil age refers to the religious world
These verses indicate that the believers have been saved from the vain manner of life handed down from their fathers
As those who have been saved from the vain manner of life handed down to us we now have a life full of purpose a life with Gods goal in view
Now we come to a matter that is both crucial and most pleasant, and this is the fact that the believers have been saved with assurance
John 5:13 says, 'I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God'
We see that the written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers that they have eternal life and are saved
Our believing in Christ to be saved and to receive eternal life is a fact the words of the Scriptures are the assurance concerning this fact
The fact that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit means that the Spirit of God and our spirit witness together
The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him that we are children of God
In the divine life we are able to love all the brothers, all the believers in Christ, no matter what their race or nationality may be
In the foregoing message we saw that the believers are saved by God in His trinity and that they are saved with assurance
Now we shall go on to see the security of our salvation, and then we shall cover the matter of clearing the past
God, the unchangeable One , has saved us, and our condition and situation cannot affect His nature or change what He has done for us
The Lord's word indicates that the Father's will is that none of those whom He has given the Son should be lost
John 4:10 says, 'In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins'
For the showing forth of His righteousness, God must justify us, and He has justified us who believe in the Lord Jesus
Our salvation, being secured by God's righteousness and His unchallengeable justification, is as unshakable as God's throne
To say that once we are saved we can be lost again means that the eternal life which has been given to us would be called back
It has definitely been covenanted that He has written the law of life within us and that He will never remember our sins
By offering Himself once to God Christ has perfected us forever , and His eternal redemption issues in our eternal salvation
Such an eternal salvation is not limited by time and space, for it is all-embracing with the divine element and nature
We are secured by two divine hands, the Father's hand of love and the Son's hand of grace, both of which are powerful to keep
Because the hands of the Father and the Son will never fail, the believers are eternally secured and will never perish
Now we come to the last matter in the initial stage of God's full salvation, the stage of regeneration-clearing the past
Although the clearing of the past is not required for initial salvation, it is needed for a better Christian life
If we follow the leading of the Lord within us to clear the past, we shall be enlivened, enlightened, strengthened, and satisfied
The religions of the world are built on their various religious codes, and their followers live and behave according to these rules
Idols and the things related to idol worship are hated by God and must thoroughly be put to an end and abandoned
We have an illustration of this in Acts 19:18 and 19, where the believers at Ephesus had a spontaneous clearing of the past
The Greek word translated 'practices' also has the technical meaning of magic spells, and that may be the meaning here
Since each piece of silver approximated a day's wage, we can see that these books were worth a great deal of money
The tax collectors used to put a higher value on property or income, or increase the tax of those unable to pay and then charge usury
A believer who makes a thorough clearing of the past will make restitution for anything gained by unjust or illegal means
Things that have been gained unrighteously or illegally should be returned, and restitution for them should be made
We would point out once again, however, that this is not a requirement for salvation but a result of the move of the Spirit
