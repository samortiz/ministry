   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING ONE WITH HIS MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As believers in Christ we have been made one with God and have become the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is both the individual Christ and the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The individual Christ is simply Christ Himself, but the corporate Christ is Christ with all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has made Himself one with man and has made man one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The oneness of Christ with His members is seen in Acts 9.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Acts 9:4 the Lord Jesus said to Paul, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul had never persecuted the individual Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He persecuted the members of Christ, yet Christ considered that as a persecution against Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Philippians 1:21 Paul said, "For to me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates Paul's oneness with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 6:17 also shows that we and Christ are one wonderful entity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The one spirit in this verse is the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The early church fathers in their writings used the word mingling to describe our oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They also taught that the believers were "deified" by being joined to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in using these terms there is the possibility of being misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we say that we are one with God, we do not mean that we become the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to make ourselves an object of worship and should be condemned as blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be one with God is to be one with Him in His divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every life produces offspring after its own kind Gen 1:11, 21, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As children of our physical father we have our father's life and nature, but we are not the same person as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A grandfather, a father, and a son all have the same life and nature, but they are different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In life and nature they are the same, but in person they are different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the children of God Rom 8:16; 1 John 3:1 we have been "deified," not in person but in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are one with God in His life and nature, but not in His person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CHRIST AS THE GOD-MAN IN DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is a God-man, a man born of two natures, the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He lived a human life on the earth and passed through trials and temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the God-man He also entered into death and accomplished an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's death terminated everything negative in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His all-inclusive death ended sin, Satan, the flesh, the old creation, our old man, and everything negative.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He was buried with all the items which He had terminated through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our old man was buried with Christ Rom 6:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sin, sins, and the devil were also buried in Christ's tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times Satan attacks us under different cloaks.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To Eve he came in the cloak of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times he comes to us in the cloak of a person or a situation to tempt us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time we should tell him not to remain with us, but to return to the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ came out of the tomb in resurrection, and in resurrection He ascended to the heavens.</S>
