   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Charging the Disciples to Go</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Disciple All the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 19 says, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because all authority had been given to Him, the heavenly King sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They go with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To disciple the nations is to cause the heathen to become the kingdom people for the establishment of His kingdom, which is the church, even today on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice that the Lord did not charge the disciples to preach the gospel, but to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The difference between preaching the gospel and discipling the nations is that to preach the gospel is simply to bring sinners to salvation, but to disciple the nations is to cause the Gentiles to become the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have been sent by the Lord not only to bring people to salvation, but also to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 19 the Lord speaks of baptizing the nations into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Baptism is to bring the repentant people out of their old state into a new one, by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ, that they may become the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John the Baptist s recommending ministry began with the preliminary baptism by water only.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now, after the heavenly King accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect; whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by water is vain; and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not long after the Lord charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 on the day of Pentecost Acts 1:5; 2:4 and in the house of Cornelius Acts 11:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts Acts 2:38 , not only visibly into water, but also invisibly into the death of Christ Rom 6:3-4 , into Christ Himself Gal 3:27 , into the Triune God Matt 28:19 , and into the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered as a tomb to terminate the old history of the baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and since the Triune God is one with the Body of Christ, so to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side to terminate their old life, and on the positive side to germinate them with a new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here is to baptize people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word into in verse 19 indicates union, as in Romans 6:3; Galatians 3:27; and 1 Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same Greek word is used in Acts 8:16; 19:3, 5; and 1 Corinthians 1:13, 15.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is one name for the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To baptize anyone into the name of the Trinity is to immerse him into all the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Matthew and John are the two books in which the Trinity is more fully revealed, for the participation and enjoyment of God s chosen people, than in all the other books of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John unveils the mystery of the Godhead in the Father, Son, and Spirit, especially in chapters fourteen through sixteen, for our experience of life; whereas Matthew discloses the reality of the Trinity in the one name for all Three, for the constitution of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit v. 18 , Christ the Son v. 18 , and God the Father v. 23 are upon the scene for the producing of the man Jesus v. 21 , who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the very embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter three Matthew presents a picture of the Son standing in the water of baptism under the open heaven, the Spirit as a dove descending upon the Son, and the Father out of the heavens speaking to the Son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter twelve, the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father v. 28 . In chapter sixteen, the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life-pulse of the kingdom vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter seventeen, the Son entered into transfiguration v. 2 and was confirmed by the Father s word of delight v. 5 for a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom 16:28 . Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ, as the last Adam, had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples, in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection, to charge them to cause the heathen to become the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the Person, the reality, of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, in the Acts and the Epistles, it is disclosed that to baptize people into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit is to baptize them into the name of Christ Acts 8:16; 19:5, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>, and that to baptize them into the name of Christ is to baptize them into Christ the Person Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3 , for Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and He, as the life-giving Spirit, is available any time and any place for people to be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a baptism into the reality of the Father, Son, and Spirit, according to Matthew, is for the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The heavenly kingdom cannot be organized with human beings of flesh and blood 1 Cor 15:50 as an earthly society; it can only be constituted with people who are immersed into the union with the Triune God and who are established and built up with the Triune God who is wrought into them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>E. Promising to Be with the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the Days until the Consummation of the Age</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 20 the Lord told His disciples, Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The heavenly King is Emmanuel, God with us 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here He promised to be with us in His resurrection with all authority all the days until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, wherever we are gathered into His name, He is in our midst 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the four Gospels, the Lord s ascension is recorded only in Mark 16:19 and Luke 24:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John testifies that the Lord, as the Son of God, even God Himself, is life to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As such, He can never leave them and would never leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continually until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, in both John and Matthew, the Lord s ascension is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the King in the kingdom with the kingdom people, the Lord is with us all the days until the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today is included in all the days.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord is with us today, and He will be with us tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not one day will be an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will be with us until the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This refers to the end of this age, which will be the time of the Lord s parousia, the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The consummation of the age, the end of the age, will be the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not want to be here during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, we prefer to be raptured into the Lord s parousia, into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the Lord s resurrection with His righteousness the kingdom is present, and we have the authority, commission, and position, to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way the kingdom is spreading.</S>
