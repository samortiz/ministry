   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Consummation of Newness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible the New Jerusalem is the consummation of newness Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the renewed believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No unrenewed person is qualified to be there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Adam was made of clay, the dust of the ground Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the New Jerusalem is not a composition of clay; it is a composition of gold, pearl, and precious stones Rev 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every part of the New Jerusalem is transformed and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today I do not have the confidence that I have been thoroughly renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when we enter into the New Jerusalem, all our clay and dust will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only gold, pearl, and precious stones will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything will be renewed; thus, the city is called the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Renewing by the Dispensing of the</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Processed Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Renewing is a matter of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The God whom we have received is the God who has passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In eternity He was only God, but through incarnation He became a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Jesus is God with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not able to receive the God who was before incarnation, but we are able to receive the God who has become a man, who has passed through human living on this earth, who has entered into death by crucifixion, and who has entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is no longer merely God alone; He is God plus humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Experiencing the Renewing</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The processed Triune God who has passed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection is for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we experience Him, we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He renews us by touching us in all the details of our human living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is concerned about what kind of shoes or necktie we wear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is also concerned about the way we comb our hair and even about what kind of buttons we have on our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you wear a certain kind of button on your clothing, you may not have the peace to eat or sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may say, "Lord Jesus, I do not believe that You are concerned about such details of my human living."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the more you say this, the more the Lord Jesus will touch you until you lose your freedom and your peace to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The younger a person is, the freer he can be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the more the young people grow in the Lord, the more the Lord will touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, their freedom will be greatly reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One time I purchased a necktie.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was nothing wrong with the necktie, but every time I put it on, I did not have peace and I could not pray freely.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I took off the necktie, I had peace and I could pray in an unhindered way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the experience of renewing.</S>
