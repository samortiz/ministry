   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading; Eph 4:12-16 THE GROWTH IN LIFE FOR FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last chapter, we saw the matters of life and fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter, we want to see the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the branches of the vine to bear fruit, there is the need of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If life does not grow, it can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The bearing of fruit does not require life alone; it requires the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all must grow that we may bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without the Father s pruning, or cleansing, it would be hard for us to grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Daily and time after time, we have to cooperate with the Father s cleansing by praying and making a thorough confession to be fully cleansed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we will have the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not pray, receive the exposing from the Father s light, cooperate with the Father s shining, and make a thorough confession of all our failures, we will be at a standstill in our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But whenever we confess our sins thoroughly, that confession brings in the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we say growth in life, we mean the growth in the divine life, not in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The growth in the divine life is the addition of God s very being into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s being, God s essence, God s element, must be added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need God added into us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have been a Christian for about sixty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Throughout all these years, God has been added into me, and today I have much more of God than I did sixty-three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our experience, the addition of God into our being may have stopped for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we became aware that this addition had stopped, we confessed to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we were once more under God s shining, and by His mercy and grace, we cooperated with this divine shining by confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the addition of God, the increase of God Col 2:19 , resumed again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After another period of time, this addition may have been frustrated again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then God was merciful to us by shining over us and touching us to make a thorough confession, and the addition of God into our being began again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through this ongoing addition, many of us can testify that we have much more of God today than we had when we were first saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The growth in the divine life is God being added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we bear fruit by this growth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We bear fruit by God being added into us daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FRUIT-BEARING FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Fruit-bearing eventually issues in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the last chapter, we saw that fruit-bearing is for the multiplication of Christ, the multiplication of Christ is for the glorification of the Father, and the glorification of the Father is for the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, the Body of Christ is this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 1:22-23 says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fullness is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A glass may be full of water, and we may say it has the riches of water, but the fullness of the water is when the water fills the cup to the brim and overflows out of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This fullness of the water is the expression of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fullness is the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Body of Christ is the fullness, the expression, of all that Christ is, the fullness of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our fruit-bearing is for the expression of the Triune God, and this expression is the Body of Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Life is for fruit-bearing, but for life to bear fruit it needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The growth in life is God added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more that God is added into us, the more growth we will have; and the more growth we have, the more fruit we will bear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Growth in life and fruit-bearing are altogether for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
