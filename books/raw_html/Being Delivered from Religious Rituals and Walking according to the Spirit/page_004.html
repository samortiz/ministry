        <h2 class="head1">CHRIST WORKING BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 12:28 says, &ldquo;If I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.&rdquo; According to this verse, the Lord Jesus worked entirely by the Spirit. He did not use His own method or His own effort; He worked by the Spirit. The co-workers should not care for methods; rather, they should care for the Spirit. The age has changed, so there are no more methods, and even if there were methods, the methods are not effective and should not be employed. We should turn from methods to the Spirit.</p>
<p>May the Lord grant us mercy to live in the Spirit and not use or follow any methods. When the Lord Jesus worked on the earth, He worked in the Spirit, not according to any methods. Hence, we also must serve in the Spirit. Our eyes need to be opened to see that we do not want methods; rather, we should work in the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit. The age has changed. We should no longer live in the age of following dead ordinances. This does not mean that everyone may do as they wish. Our Lord Jesus never kept the Judaic regulations; however, He never did anything in a wild way. The Lord lived and worked in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZING PEOPLE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 3:11 says, &ldquo;He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord was born of the Spirit, was baptized in the Spirit, was led by the Spirit, walked according to the Spirit, and worked by the Spirit. As a result, He baptized people in the Spirit. If we had lived in those days and had gone to follow the Lord, He would have baptized us in the Spirit. The Lord would not have taught us to believe that there is a God, to know that the universe and the things in it were created by God, to know that our forefather is the old Adam, or to know that we are fallen. The Lord never taught people in this way. As long as a person would repent, the Lord baptized him in the Spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This is the primary matter. The Lord did not teach people or correct them; rather, He baptized people in the Holy Spirit. This is entirely a matter of the Spirit. Christianity also baptizes people, but baptism in Christianity has become a ritual. The Lord Jesus did not follow rituals. As soon as people believed into Him, drew near to Him, and followed Him, He baptized them in the Spirit and caused them to be persons in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISCIPLES BEING PERSONS WHO ARE BAPTIZED<br />
INTO THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 28:19 says that we should go forth and baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Does this baptism refer to water baptism or to the baptism of the Spirit? Into what do we baptize people? Apparently we baptize people into water, but we actually baptize people into the Spirit. When we baptize people, we believe that although we are baptizing them with water, we are actually baptizing them into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The first time that the Bible uses this term <em>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit</em> is in Matthew 28. This term is very meaningful. The Father is the source; He has a heart&rsquo;s desire, a will, and a plan. The Son is the expression; He came to accomplish the Father&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, to fulfill the Father&rsquo;s will, and to carry out the Father&rsquo;s plan. The Son died on the cross and shed His blood to redeem us, and He resurrected from the dead to accomplish redemption, thus fulfilling the Father&rsquo;s will. Then the Spirit came to apply what the Son accomplished. The Son accomplished the Father&rsquo;s plan, and the Spirit applies the Son&rsquo;s accomplishment. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit enters into us. Not only so, through baptism we enter into the Triune God. Then all that the Father has planned is ours, all that the Son has accomplished is our portion, and all that the Spirit is applying becomes our enjoyment. This is the significance of baptizing people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>I am afraid that baptism has become a ritual or ordinance. We preach the gospel, visit the gospel friends, and prepare them for baptism. When we think that they are ready, we arrange a date for their baptism. This arrangement leaves the gospel friends with the feeling that baptism is a ritual or ordinance for them to join a religion. We may tell them that to be baptized is to die with the Lord, to be buried with the Lord, and to resurrect together with the Lord, but subconsciously, they still regard baptism as a ritual to join a religion. Likewise, the brothers who baptize do it as a ritual. Since they are assigned to baptize, it does not matter whether or not the new ones are baptized in the Spirit. The brothers care only to put the new ones into the water. Their sole responsibility is to immerse people into water. This is our condition.</p>
<p>When we baptize people, we should be filled with the Spirit, and we should believe that when we immerse them in water, we are baptizing them into the Holy Spirit. We should have this faith, and we should help the new ones to have this faith. Through this one faith and one baptism, we enter into the Holy Spirit. Those who are baptized in this way are in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is not a matter of believing certain doctrines or being baptized into a religion. It is a matter of entering into the Spirit. Formerly I was a person outside the Spirit, but now I am in the Spirit. Hence, a person should not wait in order to be baptized. A person who hears the gospel, repents, and believes should be baptized immediately. If he must wait three weeks to be baptized, the baptism will not be as effective. We should baptize a person as soon as he repents so that he can enter into the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE MATTERS CONCERNING A PERSON IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Verses 19 and 20 of chapter 10 say, &ldquo;When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.&rdquo; In verses 42 through 45 of chapter 22 Jesus said, &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David&rsquo;s. He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, &lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet&rsquo;? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?&rdquo; A person who is baptized into the Spirit becomes a person in the Spirit. These three portions of the Scriptures show three characteristics of a person in the Spirit. First, he is poor in spirit (5:3). This is not about being humble; it does not refer to humility. Rather, it is being emptied in spirit. Such a person can say, &ldquo;I have lived for so many years, yet I still need to know God.&rdquo; He may be very successful in the world, be very educated, and have many things, but he knows that he is short of God. Because he is poor in spirit, he wants God. Such a person is blessed. He does not tell the Lord that he knows or that he understands. He is poor in his spirit and tells the Lord that he does not understand the heavenly things, the spiritual things. If he is poor in spirit in this way, he will be blessed, and the kingdom of the heavens will be his. A person who is poor in spirit is in another realm; he is in the kingdom. He is no longer in the earthly realm but in the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>Second, when a person who has been baptized into the Spirit encounters a difficult situation, he is not anxious as to what to do or say, because it is not his responsibility to speak; the Spirit of the Father speaks in him (10:19-20). A person who is anxious is exercising his mind. Instead of exercising our mind, we should follow the indwelling Spirit. To be anxious is to depend on ourselves, but to follow the Spirit is to depend on the Lord. This is the principle of being a Christian.</p>
<p>Third, a person who is in the Spirit is able to know Christ in his spirit. According to the flesh, Christ is the offspring of David, but in spirit David called Christ Lord (22:42-45). David did not know Christ according to the flesh; he knew Christ in the spirit. This is the type of person we should be. We should know Christ in our spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
