[1]  Serving in the Meetings and in the Gospel CONTENTS
[2]  In these messages we will consider the proper Christian service.
[3]  There were two main matters related to the worship in the Old Testament.
[4]  According to Deuteronomy 12 to 16, the first main item was the place appointed by God as the center of worship, which eventually was Jerusalem.
[5]  All the worshippers of God in the Old Testament time had to go to Jerusalem, to the very spot chosen and appointed by God.
[6]  Our Need to Labor on Christ as Our Good Land
[7]  The surplus of the produce of the good land typifies Christ, and the way to have the surplus is to labor on Christ.
[8]  D. L. Moody, who throughout his life brought myriads of people on two continents to Christ, said that he never saw a lazy person get saved.
[9]  Because day and night we labor on Christ, we will have a rich produce that is not only good enough for us to live in Christ and by Christ, but also good enough for us to come to worship God.
[10]  When we take Christ as our life, Christ is love for us to love God, and Christ is love toward our neighbors.
[11]  Regardless of how much we know the teachings of Galatians, if we do not know how to realize the grace of Christ in our spirit, we will not be able to have the experiences of Christ taught in this book.
[12]  CHAPTER TWO OUR PRACTICE IN THE MEETINGS Scripture Reading: John 4:24
[13]  In this chapter we shall consider some practical points concerning the meetings.
[14]  Then when we come together to meet, we will know the best and proper way to meet by exercising our spirit to exhibit Christ, ministering Christ by either a hymn, a prayer, a testimony, a message, or even a tongue.
[15]  Then we will know Christ in a practical way and experience Him in our spirit, and when we come to the meetings, we will have something of Christ.
[16]  Second, we need to exercise our spirit with the indwelling Holy Spirit to worship in spirit.
[17]  Today we worship God in spirit with Christ as the surplus that we bring to God as the reality.
[18]  If we know how to exercise the spirit and if we have many experiences of Christ as the surplus in our hand, we can immediately follow the brother to give a testimony of how we experienced Christ as our patience.
[19]  We may illustrate the way to begin a meeting with playing basketball.
[20]  AND TAKING CARE OF OTHERS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:16; S. S. 1:7-8; Matt 4:18-22; John 4:24 ALL FUNCTIONING TO MINISTER IN THE MEETINGS
[21]  As we said in the first chapter, we do not use the word service in the way today s Christianity uses it.
[22]  At our right hand we need one brother, at our left hand we need another one, in front we need another, behind we need another, and on top we need still another.
[23]  If the twelve say it is right to do something, we should do it, but if even one of the twelve feels we should do something else, then we should do that instead.
[24]  We should ask, Lord, to whom should I be related?
[25]  Before we start to minister, to serve, to do our duty as living members, we need to solve the problem of being related with others.
[26]  Then we will see what kind of help we will receive simply by being related to many dear ones.
[27]  When we come to the meetings, we all have to learn to take care of others.
[28]  OF PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Acts 2:47 BEARING OUR DAILY RESPONSIBILITY
[29]  We may have a heart and desire concerning a certain person, and we may pray much for him and claim the Lord s power, but when we are with him, what will we do?
[30]  Recently the meeting for the Lord s table among us has very much improved.
[31]  Is this because the brothers and sisters love the Lord more than they did a few months ago or they have more ability and stature of spirituality?
[32]  In the past we did not have the anointing with the Lord s presence as much as we now do because we did not have much training and cooperation to meet the Lord s need.
[33]  There are two kinds of people who live in sins.
[34]  If we have this life, we have this kind of fruit, but if we do not have this life, how can we have the fruit?
[35]  We need to use the verses of the Scriptures when dealing with the above kinds of people.
[36]  Then after this, we can give them some verses that confirm the deliverance of the living Lord, such as John 8:34 and 36, which tell us that the Lord as the Son of God is able to set us free from the bondage of sin.
[37]  If we all practice this for the long run, people will be brought into the church; every month we will bring forth new fruit.
[38]  CHAPTER FIVE TEN WAYS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Hag 1:7-9
[39]  In this chapter we shall continue to speak about having an outreach and reaching unbelievers.
[40]  According to our training and experience in the church life, we have learned that we must stress the balance of five things: life, truth, service, gospel preaching, and going out for the gospel.
[41]  The matter of life is very basic; we need life to grow.
[42]  Then as regards the truth, we must be trained to know the word of the Scriptures in a proper, living way.
[43]  The second way to catch people is according to the result of sin.
[44]  I would advise you not to use this way very much, but with some persons we must use this way.
[45]  The seventh way to catch people is according to the redemption of Christ.
[46]  This is not the same as salvation; we must differentiate redemption from salvation.
[47]  If we confuse these two, our preaching will not be prevailing.
[48]  It is very easy for Christians to preach the gospel in the way of sin and hell, but not many people are able to preach the gospel in the way of Christ or the way of life.
[49]  We should consider all the people we know and choose two or three unbelievers to care for the year round.
[50]  If we live on or close to a campus and have a way to contact people, it is easy to bring them to the Lord by inviting them to our home.
[51]  If we always have someone under our care in this way, we will see how much we will learn and how much growth in life we will have.
[52]  I have the deep burden that if we mean business to practice the Body life, the church life, we need a balance of five matters: life, truth, gospel, service, and going out to other places for the gospel.
[53]  In order to truly practice the church life, we need these things.
[54]  After we pray for the burden, we must immediately pray for guidance.
[55]  This means that we should pray that the Lord will give us some definite persons, such as our classmates, roommates, neighbors, relatives, and friends.
[56]  Rather, we should pray to seek the Lord s guidance and that He would give us two or three persons to care for at the present time.
[57]  Before we go out to reach unbelievers, to invite them to our homes, to contact them with the purpose of bringing them to the Lord, we must have a definite dealing with the Lord.
[58]  First, we must deal with our sins and worldliness and consecrate ourselves to the Lord again for the purpose of gospel preaching.
[59]  We must also learn to use the word of the Scriptures in a vital, practical, and living way.
[60]  First we pray for people, claim the power from on high, and speak to them in a living way.
[61]  In this way we come to the point at which we can bring them to be saved.
[62]  When we speak with people, we come to a certain point at which we should not talk any more; we should simply use the Word to close the deal.
[63]  Then we can point out item after item of the verse in a living way to impress him: God loved, He gave, we believe, we have, and we will not perish.
[64]  If the person is still not clear, we can ask him to receive the Lord by praying, and if he says he does not know how to pray in this way, we can tell him to say in a simple way, Lord, I realize that I do not have eternal life.
[65]  As we saw in the previous message, there are at least ten ways to speak to people about the gospel.
[66]  1 sin, 2 the result of sin, 3 the vanity of human life, 4 God, 5 the love of God, 6 Christ, 7 the redemption of Christ, 8 life, 9 repentance by faith, and 10 salvation.
[67]  Human life is vain and empty, but we have God, His love, and His Christ.
[68]  But in a detailed way we need to pray, claim the power from on high, learn to speak to people in a living way, not merely according to our memory, and learn to use the Lord s word in a living, practical way.
[69]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: John 3:3, 5-6, 16, 36; Acts 11:18; 13:46, 48; Rom 5:10, 17-18; 6:4; 1 Cor 4:15; Eph 2:5; Titus 3:5; James 1:18; 1 Pet 1:3, 23; 2:2; 1 John 1:1-3; 5:11-13
[70]  When we contact unbelievers to bring them to Christ and help them to be saved, we must be very clear about the central point of the gospel, God s main purpose in saving people and bringing them to Himself in Christ.
[71]  We have pointed out ten ways to contact people for the gospel, but regardless of which way we take, we must keep the goal in mind.
[72]  We need to bring people to Christ because people need to have the life of Christ.
[73]  Whenever we bring someone to the Lord, we should help him or her to realize that the central point of God s salvation is life.
[74]  In the New Testament we first have the four Gospels.
[75]  It is not easy to say what the Gospel of Mark deals with, but if we carefully and thoroughly read this short book of sixteen chapters, we will see the example of a man on the earth who always forgets about Himself and His needs to always take care of God s interests.
[76]  In addition, 1 John 1:1 through 3 says, That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us ; that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[77]  When we bring a person to the Lord, for the most part we should not start with the matter of life.
[78]  Unless we help people to realize that they have received Christ as their life, our work with them is not yet completed.
[79]  Therefore, after we bring people to the Lord, we need to continue to spend time to help them to realize how the Lord Himself is life to us.
[80]  I am afraid that we may bring people to the Lord, but they may be saved without realizing that they have received Christ as life, that they have been born again, and that they have One living within them.
[81]  The proper burden is not only to bring people to the Lord to be saved, but to bring them to the Lord that they may realize that today Christ is life to them, that they have a spirit within them, and that when they repent and believe in the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in their spirit to regenerate them and to bring Christ as the life-giving Spirit into their spirit.
[82]  Unless we help people to realize that they have Christ within as their life, and unless they know how to exercise their spirit to contact Christ as their life, our preaching of the gospel is not complete.
[83]  If we do this, we can be assured that we will bring one or two persons to the Lord, but if we do not make such a promise, we may not bring one person to the Lord even in two years.
[84]  The more I pray, minister, and teach as one of the Lord s servants, the more I have learned not to put my trust in people; we are just not trustworthy.
