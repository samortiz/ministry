   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Truth Being the Unique Standard</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to say that the truth is absolute?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy speaks of the pillar of the truth 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why would it say the pillar of the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is because a pillar is something immovable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It cannot go up or down.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not like a chair that can be moved from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are not sober, the truth will not have any effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The truth cannot be entrusted to a person who walks according to his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a great test.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A man must stand on the side of the truth to oppose himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only by this can he maintain the truth instead of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have never been dealt with do not know what is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people lower down the truth a little when they are wrong, and lift up the truth a little when they are right.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that they are like elevators, and the truth goes up and down with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only those who have dealt with themselves are able to maintain the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord, He is the "elevator"; and we are going up and down with Him!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason for so much darkness today is that man sacrifices the truth and forces the truth to yield to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we can take the truth as the unique standard, and if we have the courage to say that since the Lord has done such-and-such a thing, we admit that we are wrong, new light will come, and a new way will be opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, you will end up thinking that you are the only right Christian on earth and that everyone else has to go along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even the truth will have to go along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who make allowances for themselves do not have much use in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person must be able to say before the Lord, "This is the truth, and I am wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not sacrifice the light, the light will uplift you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blessed are those who can go along with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only those who judge themselves have the hope of going on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who cannot go along with the truth, but instead lower the standard of the truth, will forever live in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Light will have no way to shine on them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, a man cannot preach the truth unless he has the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But on the other hand, a person has to know that the truth has nothing to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a man is brought to a point that he can no longer withstand God's word and that he finds God's word condemning him, he will receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the basis of revelation; it is the secret to receiving revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Throughout history, no one who has received God's light sacrificed God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I am not up to the standard of God's word, I have to catch up, and I have to go along with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I cannot catch up, I can only say that I have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do this, the way ahead will be clear, and we will have more and more lights.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, our reading and preaching of the truth will become vain talks and vain preachings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man's emotions can never affect God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Truth Not Being Affected or Changed</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>by Human Factors</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a thing is right, we should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it is not right, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do not do something just because you have forgotten to inform a certain brother about it last night, the truth has slipped away because of your failure to inform someone last night.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this case, your informing becomes the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to see that God's word is right and we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Personally, I can have problems with you, but this must not affect the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's work is always sacrificed because of human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reason the truth is not absolute is that problems have developed in human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can sacrifice God's truth today, but what will happen to the next generation?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What will happen to those a hundred years after us?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we sacrifice the truth, they will not be able to see the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to be absolute, a man has to pay a great price.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if we are willing to pay the price to drop ourselves, others will receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I want to be near this pillar, the way is not for the pillar to move two feet closer to me; the way is for me to move my chair two feet closer to the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can move, but the pillar cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I can change, but the pillar cannot change.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people have changed the truth because of human or historical considerations, or because of friendship.</S>
