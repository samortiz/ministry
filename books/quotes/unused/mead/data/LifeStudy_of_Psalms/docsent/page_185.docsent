   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Psalmist's</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Condemnation on the Evil Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Why do you boast in evil, O mighty one?/God's lovingkindness endures continually" v. 1 . Who is this mighty one? Why, after referring to the mighty man, does the psalmist immediately go on to speak of God's lovingkindness? There seems to be no connection here.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verses 2 through 7 it appears that David, the psalmist, is full of hatred for this mighty one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although David does not say that God will curse this one, he says, "God will likewise bring you down forever;/He will take you and pluck you up from your tent,/And uproot you from the land of the living" v. 5 . David's word here is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could a godly man pray in such a way concerning one of his persecutors?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. The Psalmist's</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Enjoyment of God in His House</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verses 8 and 9 David continued, "But I, like a flourishing olive tree/In the house of God,/Trust in God's lovingkindness/Forever and ever./I will give You thanks forever,/For You have acted;/And I will hope in Your name in the presence of Your godly ones,/For it is good."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since David was flourishing in God's house and since he trusted in God's lovingkindness, why did he still need to pray so strongly regarding the mighty one?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What should we think of David?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After reading such a psalm as this, will we continue to consider him to be perfectly spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was young, I appraised David highly, but after studying the Bible for so many years, my appreciation of him has decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, David enjoyed God in His house, even as an olive tree flourishing in the dwelling of God; on the other hand, in his prayer he condemned the evil man, saying that God would uproot him from the land of the living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How could David at the same time enjoy God and hate one of his enemies to the uttermost?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Surely this mixture of hate for an enemy and praise to God for His enjoyment of God in His house is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could a godly man mix together hatred to his enemy and praise to God in the same psalm?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what David did in Psalm 52.</S>
