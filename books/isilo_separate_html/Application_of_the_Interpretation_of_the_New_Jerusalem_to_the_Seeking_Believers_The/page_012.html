Protection</h2><p>The second function of the wall of the holy city with its foundations is to protect the interest of the riches of God&#8217;s divinity on the earth and the attainments of His consummation. What are the riches of God&#8217;s divinity, which need to be protected? Today God&#8217;s divinity has been mocked. Some say that it is a heresy to believe that we are born of God to be His children and that we are God&#8217;s family and have become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. To oppose this great truth is to mock the interest of the riches of God&#8217;s divinity on the earth.<p>Those who do not see the riches of the Father&#8217;s divinity do not know how to protect them. When we came to this country, we put out messages to define the divine Father and to thus protect the riches of the divinity of the Father. Isaiah 9:6 says clearly concerning Christ that as the child born He is called the mighty God and as the son given He is called the eternal Father. Some said that the Father in this verse does not refer to the Father in the Godhead, but to the Father of eternity. This twisting of Isaiah 9:6 implies that these ones believe in two divine Fathers-the Father in the Godhead and the Father of eternity. This is really heretical. Actually, the Father of eternity is the Father in the Godhead. Apart from the Father in the Godhead there is not another divine Father called &#8220;the Father of eternity.&#8221; We must put out the pure truth from the Word to protect the interest of the riches of God&#8217;s divinity.<p>Another example of the need to protect the interest of the riches of God&#8217;s divinity is the opposition to the truth that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b emphatically says that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection. Some twist this verse, saying that it speaks of &#8220;a life-giving Spirit,&#8221; not &#8220;the life-giving Spirit.&#8221; But besides the Holy Spirit who gives life, is there another Spirit who gives life? To say that there are two Spirits giving life is to teach a great heresy. After and through His resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit. Undoubtedly, the Spirit who gives life is the Holy Spirit.<p>The wall of the city also functions to protect the attainments of Christ&#8217;s consummation. God in Christ consummated so many things. He consummated incarnation, death, and resurrection. Today some theology mocks the reality of Christ&#8217;s incarnation, death, and resurrection. There is the need of the wall of the New Jerusalem to protect the attainments of His consummation. His attainments which He consummated in His ascension are for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal economy through His heavenly ministry. In His ascension He became the Head of the Body, the church (Col. 1:18), the Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), and the Leader and Savior (5:31). He became our High Priest (Heb. 4:14), the Mediator of the new covenant (9:15), the surety of the better covenant (7:22), and the Minister in the heavenly Holy of Holies (8:2). Today in ascension He is also the Paraclete (Advocate) of the New Testament believers (1 John 2:1; John 15:26), and our Intercessor at the right hand of God (Rom. 8:34, 26).<h2 class=head1>II. THE COLORS OF THE TWELVE LAYERS OF ITS FOUNDATIONS</h2><p>Now we want to see the application of the colors of the twelve layers of the foundation of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:19-20).<h2 class=head2>A. The Colors of the Rainbow</h2><p>The colors of its foundations are like the colors of the rainbow. The rainbow is God&#8217;s guarantee in His unfailing faithfulness that the earth will never be destroyed by the flood of water (Gen. 9:8-17). But the fire as a destructive element (Gen. 19:24-25) will be used by God to punish all His enemies for eternity (Rev. 14:10-11; 21:8). In Genesis God used two kinds of elements to destroy the human-occupied earth. First, God used water to make a flood to destroy the corrupted generation during Noah&#8217;s age. Later, the people in Sodom and Gomorrah became even more evil, so God destroyed them by another element, fire. Ultimately, the lake of fire will be used for God&#8217;s destruction of all His opposers.<p>Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, there will be a new city with the colors of a rainbow. The rainbow is a sign of God&#8217;s guarantee that He will never destroy the city. But outside of the city there will be a lake of fire, where Satan and all of God&#8217;s opposers will suffer the second kind of destructive element forever. Fire as a destructive element will be used by God to punish all His enemies for eternity.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
