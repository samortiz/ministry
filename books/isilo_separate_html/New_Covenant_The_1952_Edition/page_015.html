<h1 class="title">THE NEW COVENANT AND THE TESTAMENT</h1>
<p>In chapter three we pointed out that in the new covenant there are promises as well as facts. We also pointed out that the word &ldquo;testament&rdquo; in Hebrews 9:16 is the same word for &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; in the original text. The covenant is referred to several times in the book of Hebrews. Indeed, we might say that Hebrews has this one specific purpose, that is, to tell us what the new covenant is. Hebrews, especially chapters six through thirteen, pays special attention to this matter. Now in this chapter we come to the matter of the new covenant and the testament, or will.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 9:15-17 it says, &ldquo;And because of this He is Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. For where there is a testament there must of necessity be the death of him who made it. For a testament is confirmed where there has been death, since it has no force when he who made it is living.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;Mediator&rdquo; in verse 15 carries the meaning of one who acts as a guarantee so as to secure something which otherwise would not be obtained. In this sense, therefore, &ldquo;Mediator&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;Executor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Testament&rdquo; in verses 16 and 17 is the same as &ldquo;covenant.&rdquo; From these verses we see four important things: (1) a covenant as well as a testament, (2) the one who made the testament, or the Testator, (3) the Executor of the testament, and (4) the effectiveness of the testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A COVENANT AS WELL AS A TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Why do we say that the covenant is also the testament? Is it God or the Lord Jesus who made the covenant with us? According to God&rsquo;s Word, it is God who has made the covenant with us and not the Lord Jesus. God is the covenanting party who stands opposite to us. But it is the Lord Jesus who has accomplished the covenant, for this covenant was made with the Lord&rsquo;s blood. As far as God is concerned, He made a covenant with us; but as far as the Lord Jesus is concerned, it was through His death that He bequeathed an eternal inheritance to us (Heb. 9:15). Therefore, it is a testament, or a will. For a covenant to become effective, the death of the covenanting one is not required, but for a testament to become effective, the death of the testator is required. By this we see that it is God who made the covenant with us, but it is the Lord Jesus who through His death bequeathed the testament, the bequest, to us.</p>
<p>As far as the contents are concerned, the new covenant is the same as the testament. They are also the same as far as our inheritance is concerned, except that in the expression of it there are two sides: God&rsquo;s side and the Lord&rsquo;s side. As far as God is concerned, He has made a covenant with us; but as far as the Lord Jesus is concerned, He has left us a testament. We have said that the new covenant includes three major parts: the cleansing, life and power, and the inward knowledge. As far as God&rsquo;s making a covenant with us is concerned, it is God who promised to forgive our sins and cleanse us; it is God who promised to impart life and power to us; and it is also God who promised to give us the inward knowledge, the deeper knowledge, of Himself. But as far as the Lord Jesus leaving His testament is concerned, it is He who has left us with the cleansing which comes through the forgiveness of sins; it is He who has left us with life and power; and it is also He who has left us with the knowledge of God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS BEING THE TESTATOR</h2>
<p>We pointed out before that the new covenant was mentioned as early as the time of Jeremiah. However, for several hundred years no attention was paid to this matter. Then suddenly one day it came up again. According to 1 Corinthians 11:23-25, on the night the Lord was betrayed He &ldquo;took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood.&rdquo; The new covenant here is the very glorious new covenant mentioned in the book of Jeremiah. Now, through the blood of the Lord Jesus, this covenant has become our inheritance so that we can enjoy all its contents. This shows us that the new covenant is the Lord&rsquo;s testament, or will. Our Lord is the Testator. He has given us the spiritual inheritance in His will. What He has given us are the items included in the new covenant and indicated in Hebrews 8:10-12. These are the things which the Lord has bequeathed to us in His will. When we inherit something through a will, we receive what we did not originally possess. Through the new covenant we received something which we did not work for, but which has been bequeathed to us by the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS BEING THE EXECUTOR<br />
OF THE TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Our Lord is not only the Testator, but also the Executor of the testament, or will, for &ldquo;He is Mediator of a new covenant&rdquo; (Heb. 9:15). We said before that as the Mediator of the new covenant, He is also the Executor. We know that when writing a will it is important to have witnesses, but it is even more important to have one who can execute the will. When there is a will without an executor, the will remains idle. We praise God that the Lord Jesus is not only the One who made the will, but also the One who executes the will. As far as death is concerned, the Lord Jesus is the Testator; but as far as resurrection is concerned, He is the Executor of the will. The Lord Jesus brought the blood into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:12), indicating that the Testator had died; then the Lord Jesus became the Mediator of the new covenant in the heavens, indicating that He is the One who has the power to execute the testament. Our Lord is truly worthy to be praised! He has obtained a more excellent ministry, for He has become the Executor of the better covenant (Heb. 8:6).</p>
<p>We are told in Hebrews 12:22-24 that we have &ldquo;come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering, and to the church of the firstborn ones who have been enrolled in the heavens, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men who have been made perfect, and to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better than that of Abel.&rdquo; This passage tells us that we have not come to the mountain which can be touched (v. 18), but to Mount Zion, the gathering place for God, the angels, the resurrected just men, and the firstborn ones. This is also the place where the Lord Jesus is, He who is the Mediator of the new covenant. In the heavens the Lord is not only the High Priest, but also the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant, so that it may become effective in us. The Lord will insure that the effectiveness of this covenant established with His blood be realized in us, enabling us to have the life and power to submit to God, to have a deeper knowledge of God, and to have the forgiveness of sins with no accusation in our conscience. He is Mediator of these things. According to God&rsquo;s faithfulness and righteousness, this covenant is inviolable and irrevocable. According to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection power, this covenant is forever effective. We must say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! The Lord is the One who has left us with such a rich testament! He is also the One who has the power to execute the testament!&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
