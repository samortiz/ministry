   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX THE MANIFESTATION OF THE KINGDOM 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 25:1, 6, 10-12, 14-30</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord Jesus spoke of the kingdom on three different occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Sermon on the Mount, given in Matthew 5, 6, and 7, He spoke concerning the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 13 in a discourse given at the seashore, He spoke concerning the appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then on the Mount of Olives, the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The manifestation of the kingdom is related to the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a sense His second coming brings in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may also say that when the kingdom becomes matured within us, this maturity will bring the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The manifestation of the kingdom is simply the maturity of Christ within us in His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE TEN VIRGINS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 25, which reveals the manifestation of the kingdom, contains three important matters: the parable of the ten virgins, the parable of the talents, and the parable of the sheep and the goats.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All three are related to the Lord's second coming, and all three are related also to the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this chapter we will cover only the first two parables.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The parable of the ten virgins is related to the manifestation of the kingdom because it says that the kingdom is likened unto ten virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At midnight the Lord returns, and all ten of the virgins arise to go forth and meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time five wise virgins receive the reward and are able to enter into the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Five others who are foolish are shut out from the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, five receive a reward, and five miss the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord Jesus comes back and the kingdom is manifested, all the real Christians will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we have done since we have been saved will be judged by the Lord Jesus at that time 1 Cor 3:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will not be a judgment to determine whether we are saved or lost, but to determine whether we will receive the reward or miss the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to determine whether we shall enter into the marriage feast or be shut out of the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This matter is very clear in the parable of the ten virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of the lack of revelation in past centuries, many Christians have considered that the five foolish virgins were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But according to the pure Word the five foolish virgins are real virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They may be foolish, but they are not false.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because one is foolish does not mean that he is false.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One may be foolish and yet still be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The five foolish virgins are real Christians, but they will miss something at the Lord's coming in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some real Christians will miss the marriage feast.</S>
