<h2 class=head2>B. The Medium of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[The life of God rests in the Holy Spirit of God, and it is through the Holy Spirit of God that the life of God enters into us and lives in us. Therefore, the fellowship brought to us by the life of God, though derived from the life of God, comes by means of the Holy Spirit of God. Hence, the Bible also calls this fellowship “the fellowship of the Holy Spirit’’ (2 Cor. 13:14). Therefore, if we desire to have fellowship of life, we must not only have the life of God, but also live in the Holy Spirit of God. The life of God is the source of the fellowship of life, and the Holy Spirit of God is the medium of the fellowship of life.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Meaning of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>Fellowship [means joint participation, common participation. It is the issue of the eternal life, and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers who have received and possess the divine life. It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is called “the fellowship of the Holy Spirit’’ (2 Cor. 13:14) and “fellowship of (our) spirit’’ (Phil. 2:1). It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we the believers participate in all the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14).]<p>This life [flowed out from God, and flowed into thousands of saints, including us. This flowing life is from God; it passes through God, and it passes through thousands of saints, including us. Thus it causes us to have fellowship with God and with thousands of saints.]<p>Another [meaning of the fellowship of life is the flowing of life. This flowing of life is not separated from life; rather it is the fellowship of the flowing of life itself. This fellowship of the flowing of life requires that we continuously walk and live by following it and yielding to it. Whenever we do not follow it or yield to it, it stops flowing. Thus the fellowship between us and God is severed, and the fellowship between us and the saints is also gone.<p>In 1 John 1:6 John says, “If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.’’ To have fellowship with God is to have an intimate and living contact with Him in the flow of the divine life according to the Spirit’s anointing in our spirit (2:27). This keeps us in the participation and enjoyment of the divine light and divine love.]<h2 class=head2>D. We Must Maintain the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[It is very important for us to realize that the believers’ relationship in life with God is unbreakable. However, their fellowship with Him is breakable. The former is unconditional; the latter is conditional. Once we have been regenerated, we are children of God, and we have a relationship in life with our Father. Our relationship with God is based on life and has been settled once for all. Therefore, the life relationship with God has no conditions and is unbreakable. But our fellowship with God has certain conditions, it is breakable, and it may fluctuate.] Therefore, we must pay much attention to maintain the fellowship of life. Whenever we feel that the fellowship is broken, we must repent and confess to restore this fellowship.<h2 class=head2>E. The Function of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[What is the function or use of the fellowship of life? It is to inwardly supply us with all that is in the life of God or all that is in God. All the fullness in God is supplied to us through the fellowship of life. The more we allow the flowing of life to flow in us, the more we are inwardly supplied with the fullness of God. Such supply of the fellowship of life is like the circulating of the blood as the supply of the body and like the flowing of electricity as the supply of the lights.<p>The sense of life proves whether we are living in God or not. And the fellowship of life continuously supplies us with the things of life. Whenever your supply of life is cut off, it means that your fellowship of life is interrupted. If we continuously live in the fellowship of life, our supply of life will come continuously and unceasingly.] This type of supply helps us to live a normal Christian life.<h2 class=head2>F. A Cycle of Life</h2><p>In 1 John 1:1-7 we see [a cycle in our spiritual life formed of four crucial things—the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God. Eternal life issues in the fellowship of the divine life, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need of the blood of Jesus the Son of God] so that we may have more eternal life. The more we have of eternal life, the more of its fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. [The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach its maturity.] Thus, we see that we have all that we need to experience life, to grow in life and to mature in life. Hallelujah!
