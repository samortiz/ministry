   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING MAINLY DUE TO INDIVIDUALISM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a certain matter that causes my heart to ache.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After hearing a brother speak, some have come to me and complained that he was attacking others in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the brothers give messages, their purpose is to edify.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the content of their messages, I do not believe the brothers say anything heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is also no need for them to attack others when they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have a motive in our labor, we are not doing the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The saints are as simple as children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The brothers should cooperate with God to speak for God for the purpose of building, not for tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The brothers who minister the word should not help on one hand and transmit germs on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, the saints will be edified and harmed at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will issue in the tearing down of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After listening to a message given by a young brother, some have come to me and asked about his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that there is a thorn in his work that makes people feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may think that we have done a work yet be unaware of a thorn in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of work is not helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our messages should not attack people; they should be positive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our speaking should give life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It should not cause people to make negative comparisons or have a critical or judgmental feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The goal of our speaking is the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we should not give the saints the impression that our speaking is higher than that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, the saints should have the impression that our speaking is in harmony with the speaking of others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The saints should not feel that one brother is attacking another brother when he gives a message.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the brothers speak from different angles, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we must endeavor to speak words of building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This requires us to be broken and built.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, it will not be possible for us to do God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a solemn matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the local churches stand on the proper ground, the situation among the churches seems to be one of self-government.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not have local flavors; rather, we should have only the flavor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, if we come to Kaohsiung we should sense that we are simply the church in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A believer can only be in one locality, and he should be for the building in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this can cause another problem if a local church is unwilling to fellowship with other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When different localities were being raised up by the Lord, the brothers did not know how to administrate the churches, and they relied on other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, the churches in Tainan and Kangshan depended on the church in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After making some progress, they began to take care of themselves without depending on Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although they do not quarrel, argue, or dispute with the church in Kaohsiung, they practice self-government.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those in Kaohsiung may be able to break the bread with them, but there is a feeling of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is not even the building among the individual saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The lack of building among the local churches is the result of a lack of building among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers who do the young people s work do not depend on one another for life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is very disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are clever and capable and feel that it is more efficient to work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This type of individual labor, however, will not have any result.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although they may not quarrel or argue with others, they are unable to get along with others and serve the Lord together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, there is no blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot deceive others concerning our true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When others touch our spirit, they can know our true condition and are clear whether we are being dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The responsible ones for the young people s work have an uncooperative spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They say that they need others and that they cannot be independent; however, in their hearts, they wish that they did not have to work with others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we want to have the Lord s blessing and His presence, and if we want others to be edified, we need to learn to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must do one work in the position, atmosphere, and spirit of being built.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only then will our work produce the result that God seeks and blesses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have seen this light, we will prostrate ourselves before God and say, I cannot live independently of others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I need to be built regardless of how spiritual I am.</S>
