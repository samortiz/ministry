This will test the endurance of the saints: the Jews, who keep the commandments of God, and the believers, who keep the faith of Jesus (Rev. 14:9-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7.

In Daniel 12:11-12<br>One Thousand Two Hundred Ninety Days and One Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-five Days Being Mentioned</H2><P>In Daniel 12:11-12 one thousand two hundred ninety days and one thousand three hundred thirty-five days are mentioned. One thousand two hundred ninety days refers to the time from Antichrist's stopping of the offering and sacrifice and his replacing of them with idols to the end of his desolating and defiling of the temple, which will be a thousand two hundred and sixty days (Dan. 12:11; Rev. 11:2-3), plus thirty days for the cleansing of the defiled temple. The children of Israel need thirty days to cleanse the devastated and defiled temple. One thousand three hundred thirty-five days will be forty-five days more than one thousand two hundred ninety days, which forty-five days will be for the preparation of the priestly service for the offering and sacrifice, that the blessing of the offering and sacrifice may be recovered for the people of Israel. Daniel 12:12 says, "Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days." Joel 2:14 says, "Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God" (ASV). According to this verse, the blessing is the offerings. Based upon this verse, we can say that the forty-five days will be for the preparation of the priestly service to resume the offering of the sacrifices, which has always been a great blessing to the people of Israel.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
