   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paying the Price to Obey</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord says in the Bible, "Or do you not know...?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 6:9, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that we ought to know such things already, because a living God is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have to learn to follow closely the inner leading.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If God tells you to give up certain things and to forsake them, you should say, "Lord, for the sake of loving You, I would forsake them."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians today like to listen to teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Very few of them listen to the voice within them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would like to ask the brothers and sisters who are sitting here if there is anyone who has been obeying God from morning until evening today in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have a genuine desire to take care of God's word, He will only have to speak once.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you do not have this desire, even if He were to speak many times, it would still be useless to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is a group of people here who are willing to give themselves completely to God, in a year's time this place will have a complete turnaround.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if there is not such a group of people, then even if someone were to preach to the people the whole year round, it would still not be of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every time we want to obey the inner feeling, we have to pay a price, because to do such a thing would cause pain to our self and would inflict loss on us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will show how much you really love God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are not willing to obey, even if you listen to a hundred more messages, it will still not do you any good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Obeying in a Simple Way</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there is a small number of brothers and sisters who will obey God, His blessing will be brought in through them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only when we learn to live in the reality of the spiritual things can we have real spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the only thing that will cause us to live before God and in His light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our inner feeling and guidance is our spiritual restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we go along with this feeling, we go along with the spiritual restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's way is always simple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If it is complicated, it is because we have made it so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OBEYING THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Question: We may know the leading and the restriction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But why is it that we are not able to obey this leading and restriction?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not a Question of Being Able,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>but a Question of Being Willing</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Lee answered: Actually, the issue is not one of being able or not able, but of being willing or not willing to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not a question of ability, but a question of willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are willing, God will manifest His strength upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were all paralyzed and were unable to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when we obey, strength will come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord called the paralyzed person to stand up and walk, he was able to stand up and walk Mark 2:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God says yes, you have to say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God says to put your feet down, you have to put your feet down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The water of the Jordan will spontaneously be divided Josh 3:8, 13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your eyes should never be fixed on the water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you look at the water, you will say, "The Lord must divide the water first before I can put my feet down."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do that, the water will never be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Secret of "Willingness"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Being Drawn by the Love of God</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can you become willing?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The secret of willingness is to be drawn by the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a matter of how much you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do not love enough, you will feel that you cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you love enough, you will be able to obey what others cannot obey, and you will be able to do what others cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only those who love the Lord with a single heart can go on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, it is not a question of whether or not you are able, but a question of whether or not you are willing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to be willing, you have to love the Lord, and you have to be constrained by the Lord's love.</S>
