<h2 class="head1">DISCERNING THE FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>The full-timers will not be considered or discerned by a center. We have no center. We avoid leadership and any centrality of practice. Let every church examine, discern, and make a decision as to whether one is right and proper to drop his job and go full-time. You must be careful about this. Some are like those spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15, idle, working at nothing, but busybodies, eating other&rsquo;s food. We do not accept this kind of job-dropping full-timers. We like to see that the young ones in school are good students, all the time making high scores and having characters so straight and right. There must be no sign of any kind of slothfulness or idleness. They must be discerned, even sifted.</p>
<p>The door is not open in a loose way for the job-dropping full-timers. Some lazy ones may consider this as the opportunity to sit, drink coffee, and talk about spiritual things. They would consider that in the United States they have ten thousand supporters, and that they do not need to labor or worry about anything. Although no one would say this, deep in their beings it might be so. We have no center. All the job-dropping full-timers will be discerned, judged, decided upon and sifted by their own respective churches. Therefore, all the elders have to learn something. You have to do the job and make the recommendation. The work will not accept anyone to drop their job to go full-time without the elders&rsquo; recommendation.</p>
<p>If your account for the fellowship unto the gospel would be adequate to support them, that would be wonderful. If it is not, try to fellowship with other churches. Those churches who have a surplus in this account should fellowship with other churches, letting them know that they have a surplus to take care of the job-dropping full-timers in other churches. Do not say that because a certain full-timer is not working for the church in your locality, you would not care for his support. This is wrong. Whether or not he is the one determined, discerned, examined, judged, sifted, and eventually recommended by you, you must take care of his support. Whether he will be working in your locality or will go abroad to Thailand you must support him. I hope that some day many from Taiwan will go to Thailand. I do not have the time to pour out what is on my heart. I hope that Taiwan will be taken. Then all the saints from Taiwan can go to Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even to India, Ceylon, Pakistan, and the Arabian countries. This is all on my heart. Do not be narrow. We are taking a new way to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>I advise you all and even I beg you all to practice this. If at the present time you do not have that many job-dropping full-timers, then keep a savings account for the fellowship unto the gospel in the future. Perhaps one day a good number will go out from the United States to the Philippines. If fifty would go to the Philippines under my instruction, they could conquer the entire country for Christ and the church.</p>
<p>We are short of personnel and we are short of financial support. Therefore, we must encourage the lovers of the Lord Jesus in our locality to drop their jobs to go full-time. They do not need to worry. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is here, and so many faithful lovers of the Lord Jesus would give their money. Now we do have a practical practice. Each one would put aside five percent for this purpose. The number one thing is to encourage all the lovers of the Lord to drop their jobs if possible. Secondly, we must encourage all the money-making full-timers doing business to spend every penny for the Lord&rsquo;s spread. If we do these two things, and if we all would take the same way in one accord by prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, the Lord will have a great success through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOW WORKERS IN THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Third John 8 says, &ldquo;We therefore ought to support such, that we may become fellow workers in the truth.&rdquo; The ones spoken of here are the travelers for the preaching of the gospel and the teaching of the truth (vv. 5-7). Everyone who is a money-making full-timer may be a fellow worker in the truth. Although it seems that they do not do anything for the preaching of the gospel and the teaching, they still could be fellow workers by giving every penny to support these preachers and teachers who go out.</p>
