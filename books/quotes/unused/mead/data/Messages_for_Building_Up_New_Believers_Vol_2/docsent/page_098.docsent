   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, they will become disheartened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I read of a story about a little girl whose mother only knew how to beat and scold her children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The child had a good disposition when she was young.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They will think that since one can be careless with his words, he can be careless with anything.</S>
