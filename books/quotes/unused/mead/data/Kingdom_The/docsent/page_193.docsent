   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE HARVEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Other Christians consider that the rapture will occur with all Christians simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They think that when the Lord Jesus comes back, all of the real believers will be taken suddenly from the earth into the air at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This concept fully neglects the principle of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The principle of the harvest is that fruit is harvested as it becomes ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of the crop ripens first, and is reaped as the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a minority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then comes the harvest of the majority of the crop.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, comes the reaping of the gleanings or the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are at least three different stages of harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This picture in the Bible is an exceedingly clear type.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In kindergarten classes many pictures are used to teach the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same manner the Lord uses the picture of the harvest to clearly portray the matter of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we only pick up the clear words in the New Testament, we may not understand the rapture so well; but if we look at the pictures, it is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have a clear picture of the rapture of the believers in the type of the reaping of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a type in the Old Testament, and it is fulfilled in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Matthew 13 there is the harvest, and in Revelation 14 there are both the firstfruit and the major part of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the major part of the crop will become mature, and the harvest time will come.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Very close to this time, a few will become mature early.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They will become the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The major part will then ripen later and will be the general harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, some who are at the corner or the edges of the field will still be green and need a further time to become mature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are the gleanings or the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why has the harvest time of the Lord not yet come?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the situation today, there is hardly any possibility for the Lord Jesus to come back because the major part of the crop is still green and not ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be desperate with the Lord to be saturated and to be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the major part of the crop is ripe and ready for the harvest, that will be the time for the Lord Jesus to come and reap.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just before this reaping, some who are matured early will be reaped as the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is very clear, from Matthew to Revelation, that the New Testament teaches that the rapture will occur not merely once but several times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The rapture of the firstfruit will be a short while before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The tribulation will be mainly a period of seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the book of Revelation are seven seals, and the last of the seven seals consists of seven trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The last of the seven trumpets will be sounded quite close to the end of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By reading Revelation carefully we can realize that the great tribulation will probably begin from the first trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It will not begin from the time of the first seal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first seal has nearly been fulfilled already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second, third, and fourth seals have begun to be fulfilled and are still being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once these four seals are completed, the fifth and sixth seals will come, and after these are finished, the seventh seal will come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The seven trumpets are the content and the totality of the seventh seal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Remember that the great tribulation will begin with the first trumpet and will continue until the last trumpet.</S>
