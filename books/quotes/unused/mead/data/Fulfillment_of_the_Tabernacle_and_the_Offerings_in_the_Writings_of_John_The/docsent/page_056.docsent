   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FOUNTAIN AND A SPRING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you know the difference between the Lord as a fountain and the Lord as a spring?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord is outside of us, objective to us, He is the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when He is inside of us, subjective to us, He is the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were in the Holy Land some years ago, we visited the source of the River Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the foot of Mount Hermon, we saw a strong spring welling up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were told that underneath the mountain there was a fountain, which was the source of that spring.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That fountain was in the depths, whereas the spring was on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is the fountain of living water; on the other hand, He is the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God, the Lord is the fountain, but in us He is the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to our experience, we know that the Christ who is in God is the source, the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when He enters into us and dwells in us, He becomes a spring welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>NOT TRUSTING IN A TRADITIONAL WELL</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not trust in our Bible knowledge, in our past experience, or in traditional teachings we have received from others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All such things may be a Jacob's well to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Daily we need to remember and realize that we have a living spring within us and that this spring is a divine Person, the Son of God, who has been given to us by God as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that within us we have a spring that is the gift of God!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, in their experience many Christians still have a traditional well and not a living spring.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you speak with them about the Spirit or eternal life, they may argue with you according to their tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christians who trust in their traditions are like the Samaritan woman in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was such a Samaritan woman about fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I no longer put my trust in a traditional well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you have a "Jacob's well," or do you enjoy the living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is possible to be a Samaritan woman with a traditional well even in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may regard the books and the messages in the recovery as your traditional well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that no well, regardless how genuine, typical, and ancient it is, can quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our thirst can be quenched only by the living Person of the Son of God, who has been given by God to be the spring welling up within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is possible for us to take a Christian leader as our Jacob and his teachings as our well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lutherans have done this with Martin Luther and his teaching concerning justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may know about their "well," but they may not know the living Person, Jesus Christ, as the living water within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me tell you an actual story involving a Lutheran pastor in China.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This particular man was an opium smuggler while he was a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day a Norwegian woman evangelist came to the city where that pastor lived and began to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She did not preach about any kind of "well," and she did not preach justification by faith in an old, traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, she preached regeneration by the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After every message she would go immediately to the main entrance of the chapel and talk with those who were passing by.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She would ask the same question of each person: "Have you been regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you been born again?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That Lutheran pastor tried unsuccessfully to avoid her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She stopped him and in front of a number of people asked him if he had been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He answered that he had been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, she said, "Look at you!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have never been regenerated!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because this was spoken in the presence of members of his congregation, he was offended.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Insulted by the way this evangelist had spoken to him, the Lutheran pastor went home and spent much of the night plotting how to kill her.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But at a certain time the Spirit of God began to point out to him how sinful he was.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit said to him, "How evil you are!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are an opium smuggler.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because this woman rebuked you, you were offended, and now you are thinking of a way to kill her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Don't you realize how sinful you are?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"As a result of the Spirit's work, he thoroughly repented and was truly saved and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The next day he attended the meeting and testified of what had happened to him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His testimony brought in a genuine revival.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The experience of this Lutheran minister illustrates the difference between trusting in some traditional well and enjoying the renewing, refreshing Person of the living Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although traditional teaching does not count for anything as far as the living Christ is concerned, many Christians continue to depend on traditional things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In some cases their knowledge, including the knowledge of the Bible, is traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible itself is not traditional, but it is taken in a traditional way by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some may claim that they know all about the seed of the woman in Genesis 3 or about the names of the Lord in Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yes, they may know these things, but they know them in the way of tradition, not in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In their way of handling the Word of God, there is no life, no freshness, no renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can testify that we truly love the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, we do not love the Bible in a traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the contrary, we love the Word because in it we can meet the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is the real gift of God with eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am very concerned for some of the saints in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They come to the meetings again and again, but what do they receive?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do they receive more traditional teachings, or do they contact a living Person?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When you listen to a message in a ministry meeting, do you receive a living Person as eternal life, or do you take the ministry as something traditional?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all must learn not to put our trust in any traditional well, but learn to experience Christ daily as the living water welling up within us into eternal life.</S>
