   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:20 Paul speaks both of Christ and of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The title Christ mainly denotes Christ s mission to carry out God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son of God denotes Christ s Person to impart God s life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the faith in which we live God s life is in the Son of God, the life-imparting One.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Son of God loved us and purposely gave Himself for us that He might impart the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life which we now live in the flesh is not bios, the physical life, not psuche, the soulish life, but zoe, the spiritual and divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE FAITH WHICH OPERATES IN US</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul says that the life we now live in the flesh we live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We live the divine life, not by sight or by feeling in the way we live the physical and soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The divine life, which is the spiritual life in our spirit, is lived by the exercise of faith stimulated by the presence of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In speaking of faith, Paul refers to the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the meaning of the little word of here?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word implies that the faith mentioned in this verse is the Son of God s faith, the faith which He Himself possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in interpreting this verse, we and many others have said that this phrase actually means faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, the Greek does not use the preposition in here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have spent a good deal of time trying to understand this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After consulting the writings of a number of leading authorities, I have become fully convinced that here Paul is not speaking of the Son s faith, but of faith in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we still need to explain why in this verse, as well as in 2:16 and 3:22, Paul does not use the preposition in. We cannot gain a proper understanding of this simply by studying the Scripture in black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also need to consider our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul wrote the book of Galatians both according to truth and according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to our Christian experience, the genuine living faith which operates in us is not only in Christ, but also of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, Paul s meaning here actually is the faith of and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul s thought is that the faith is both of Christ and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have pointed out that faith is our appreciation of what the Lord is and of what He has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have also pointed out that genuine faith is Christ Himself infused into us to become our ability to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the Lord has been infused into us, He spontaneously becomes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, this faith is of Christ; on the other hand, it is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, it is too simple merely to say that this faith is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to say that it is Christ revealed to us and infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Faith is related not only to the Christ who has been infused into us, but also to the Christ who is infusing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As Christ operates in us, He becomes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This faith is of Him and also in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>APPRECIATING THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Proof that the faith in 2:20 is both the faith of Christ and the faith in Christ is found in Paul s words at the end of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He concludes the verse by referring to the Son of God as the One Who loved me and gave Himself for me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In writing these words, Paul was filled with appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Otherwise, at the end of such a long verse there would have been no need for him to speak of Christ loving him and having given Himself for him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He could have concluded with the expression, the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as he was speaking of the way he now lived, his heart was filled with gratitude and appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Faith comes from such an appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The faith in Christ and the faith of Christ issues from the appreciation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 2 Corinthians 5:14 and 15 Paul says, For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we consider these verses, we can see that Paul s faith came from an appreciation for the constraining love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we appreciate Christ s constraining love, the more faith we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This faith is not produced by our own ability or activity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, it is produced by the working in us of the very Christ whom we appreciate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our appreciation for the Lord Jesus, we shall say, Lord Jesus, I love You and I treasure You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we speak such words to the Lord, He operates within us and becomes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This faith brings about an organic union in which we and Christ are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I would like to tell you a true story which confirms the point that the faith which operates in us comes from our appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During the Boxer Rebellion in China, hundreds of Christians were martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day in Peking, the old capital of China, the Boxers were parading down the street.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sitting in the back of a wagon was a young Christian woman who was being led away to be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She was surrounded by executioners with swords in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The atmosphere was terrifying, filled with the shoutings of the Boxers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, her face was glowing as she was singing praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The stores were closed because of the rioting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, a young man was observing this scene through a crack at the front of a store.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Deeply impressed with the young woman s glowing face, happiness, and songs of praise, he decided at that moment that he would find out the truth about the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Later, he did learn the truth and became a believer in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, he gave up his business and became a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day, when he was visiting my home town, he told me this story of how he had become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The point here is that this young woman could be filled with praises in the midst of such a terrifying situation because faith was working within her.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She was filled with appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because she loved Him so much, He spontaneously became the faith within her.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This faith produced an organic union in which she was joined to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This organic union is a basic and crucial aspect of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A REVELATION OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Galatians had turned from God s economy and had gone back to the law, which they were trying to keep by the efforts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But when we endeavor to keep the law in this way, we are far off from God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God s economy is not that we try to keep the law in the strength of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His economy is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Triune God has become the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Through incarnation, Christ came in the flesh to fulfill the law and then to set it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Through His resurrection, Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, ready to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God s New Testament economy is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into us to become our life and our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we see this, we shall be able to proclaim that we have been crucified with Christ and that we live no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Nevertheless Christ lives in us, and we live by the faith that is in Him and of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our old person has been crucified, but the new person, the new I, still lives.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now we live by faith in the Son of God and of the Son of God, a faith that produces an organic union in which we and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is no comparison between keeping the law and such an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Galatians 2:20 is a revelation of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In His economy God s intention is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into our being to make us a new person, a new I. The old person, the old I, the I without God, is over; but the new person, the new I, the I with the Triune God in it, still lives.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We live with Christ and by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Furthermore, we live by faith, which is the means to bring us into oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In this organic union we are one with the Lord, for we have one life and one living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When we live, He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He lives in us, and we live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>THE VISION OF CHRIST LIVING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I believe that now we can understand what it means to say that Christ lives in us and that the life which we now live, we live by the faith of the Son of God who loved us and gave Himself for us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The experience portrayed in this verse implies that God in His Trinity has been processed.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After Christ was incarnated, He lived on earth and then was crucified, buried, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After His ascension, Christ was crowned, enthroned, and made the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>On the day of Pentecost, He descended as the Spirit upon His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>From that time until now, He has been working and moving on earth, seeking those who will appreciate Him and call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Whenever we call on the Lord Jesus out of our appreciation of Him, He comes into us and becomes the living faith which operates in us and brings us into an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In this union we can truly say, I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, Who loved me and gave Himself for me.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I hope that this vision will be infused into all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I can testify that because I have seen this heavenly vision, nothing can move me.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am willing to give my whole life for such a vision of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The old person has been crucified with Christ, and Christ now lives in me, the new person.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The life I now live, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God and in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Here we have the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>How wonderful!</S>
