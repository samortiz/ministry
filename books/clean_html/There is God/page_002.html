<h2 class=head1>GOD EXPRESSED THROUGH MANKIND</h2><p>The very existence of mankind speaks of the existence of God. The human body is a true marvel. Although modern medicine has invented many machines to imitate and to replace man’s organs and limbs, no machine can come close to the dexterity and effectiveness of the human organs. The human heart pumps 72 times a minute, or 40 million times a year, while one is awake or asleep. Every day an adult heart pumps blood through 100,000 miles of blood vessels, enough to travel around the world four times. It pumps enough blood to fill a 2,000-gallon tank car every day. Who could have designed such a wonderful organ within man? If one were to pile up the red blood cells in his body, the height would exceed that of Mount Everest five thousand times! The nose inhales air seventeen times a minute. Every day it has to process about 14,000 liters of air. In addition to adjusting the temperature of the air, it also has to temper its humidity and filter its dust. A man-made machine that will handle all these three functions might weigh one hundred pounds. What if such a “man- made nose” were to be installed on our face! These are but a few examples of the wonders of the human body. If we stand before a mirror, we cannot help but agree with what the psalmist in the Bible said: “I am awesomely and wonderfully made; Your works are wonderful, and my soul knows it well” (Psa. 139:14).<p>The very makeup of the human personality is also a strong proof to the creation of God. Man is not just made of an outward body, but is endowed with some natural traits such as tendencies and aptitudes to love, to be upright, to be holy, and to be righteous. These psychological inclinations are in every person, irrespective of the culture he inherits or the kind of language he speaks. No animal comes close to man in demonstrating these virtues. We must conclude that these human characteristics come from a source higher than man. The Bible says that they come from God, who Himself is the source of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The reason man reflects these divine traits is that he was made in the image of God (Gen. 1:26-27).<p>Furthermore, there is a strange tendency in man to worship God. Even the most primitive culture is replete with ways and rituals in the worship of deity. The study of anthropology has found that this worship trait is peculiar to the human species. A monkey never builds a shrine, and a chimpanzee never prays. But everywhere on the earth man prays to God. The Bible says that man was created with a spirit (Job 32:8). This spirit is the organ with which man contacts and worships God.<p>The very fact that mankind has been able to exist until today is a testimony to the sovereignty of God. If God had held back the sunshine and the air, man would have ceased to exist on this earth long ago. Every second the sun burns up the equivalent of four million tons of fuel in order to keep our planet warm. If God were to charge man for this energy consumption, man would have to come up with about 160,000,000,000,000 U.S. dollars a day. But all this sunshine and air has come to us free. As the Bible says, “He Himself gives to all life and breath and all things” (Acts 17:25).<p>The ancient Greek poets declared, “For we are also His [God’s] race” (Acts 17:28). The ancient Chinese sage Confucius called God “heaven” and taught men to honor Him. Socrates had “a strong belief in God as ruler of the world.” St. Paul in the Bible said that “in Him we live and move and are” (Acts 17:28). One of Russia’s most distinguished writers, Leo Tolstoy, was but echoing the words of St. Paul when he declared, “God is He without whom one cannot live.”<p>Without God, human history could not have evolved the way it has evolved. God is behind everything that happens among mankind. He is the sovereign Ruler, the King above all kings. The first century Roman Empire persecuted the Christians, but in the end the Roman emperor Constantine himself was converted to Christianity. When Hitler attacked England, and again when he invaded Russia, for a time it seemed as if he would prevail. But God was sovereign in preventing his army from advancing. In the course of human history, though evil forces may prevail for a while, in the end goodness always wins. No despot or tyrant can establish his kingdom forever. King Nebuchadnezzar of the ancient Babylonian Empire boasted of his own glory, and was made to live like a beast for a season, until he humbled himself before the Almighty. The founding fathers of the United States of America realized that it is God who allows a government to stand. Over the United States capitol building the words  “In God We Trust” are inscribed. The same words are inscribed on every piece of American currency. The course of human history is a strong testimony to the existence of God.
