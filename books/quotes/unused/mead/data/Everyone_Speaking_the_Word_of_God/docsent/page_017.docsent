   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we come to the point of the word of God increasing, multiplying, and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, we need to pray for the word of God, asking God to open a door for His word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The churches on the whole island of Taiwan really need to receive this burden and pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only do the unbelievers need a door to be opened among them; even many Christians in the denominations, especially those in the Catholic Church, need God to open a door among them, because they themselves have closed the door.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because they lack enlightenment, they have fallen into darkness, thinking that they already know the truth but not actually understanding it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the Lord has opened His Word not for us only, but for all the Christians, even for the people of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to pray, Lord, open the door for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul asked the believers to pray that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ Col 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, Paul said, Pray concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified 2 Thes 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Running is a matter of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once the door is opened, there is still the need to have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ordinarily, people walk on the way first and then go through the door.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But according to the Bible, we first must go through the door, and then we can walk on the way Matt 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As soon as the door is opened, the way is wide open to let the word of God run and be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE WORD OF GOD INCREASING AND MULTIPLYING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Acts 12:24 says, The word of God grew and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This growth and multiplication of the word took place in three stages in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first stage was during the ministry of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During this time Acts 6:7 says that the word of God grew.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second stage was at the time when Peter s ministry was coming to an end. Although Peter was put into prison, God released him from that prison, and as a result the word of God grew and multiplied Acts 12:24 . The last stage was in Paul s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While Paul was in Ephesus, he prevailed greatly in the struggle for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Acts 19:20 says, So the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE WORD OF GOD PREVAILING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation 19 the Lord Jesus coming down out of heaven appears as a general fighting a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is riding on a white horse, and His name is called The Word of God Rev 19:11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word of God that we speak today is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, as we continue to speak, our speaking will cause the Lord Jesus to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord comes, He comes as a warrior, a general.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On His garment and on His thigh the name King of kings and Lord of lords is written Rev 19:16 .</S>
