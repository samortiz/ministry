   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REBUILT TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The overall subject of all the extracts in the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that in the extracts we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter two of John, in particular, reveals the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The building up of the destroyed temple is certainly related to the reality of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This rebuilt temple is the very tabernacle into which we must enter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first mention of the tabernacle in the Gospel of John is in 1:14: "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in chapter two we again see the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter two this tabernacle was first the physical body of the Lord Jesus, God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said, "Destroy this temple" 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"This temple" corresponds to the tabernacle in 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that this tabernacle is the incarnated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At a certain time, the temple of the Lord's physical body was destroyed by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following that, the divine life within the Lord Jesus rebuilt that destroyed temple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now this rebuilt temple has become the real temple, the real tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tabernacle in 1:14 was real; however, it was not as real as the rebuilt temple in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tabernacle in 1:14 was only in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when it had been destroyed and rebuilt, it was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be in resurrection is to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the rebuilt tabernacle is the real tabernacle in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the tabernacle in 1:14 did not include us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the rebuilt temple in chapter two not only includes us; it is also composed of us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The genuine entering into the tabernacle means that we are included in the composition of this tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the rebuilt tabernacle is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By what way do we enter the church as God's tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We enter the tabernacle by being built into it, not by merely coming into it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you only come into the tabernacle, you may go out after a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only thing that can keep you in the tabernacle is the fact that you are built into it and you thus become a part of its composition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us use a church meeting hall as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We come into the hall for a meeting, but after the meeting is over we leave the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the materials that have been built into the meeting hall, especially the beams and the columns, never leave it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only way to remove the beams and the columns from the meeting hall would be to demolish the building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same principle, we all should be built into the church as today's tabernacle of God Rev 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not believe that anyone can take me out of the church life, because I have been built into the church and have become part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only way to remove me from the church life would be to utterly destroy the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If that were to happen, I would be destroyed along with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The point we are making is that the rebuilt temple in chapter two of John includes us all and is built with us all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that we are the temple, the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need the types in Exodus and also the signs in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we did not have the Old Testament types, we would not have an adequate knowledge of the signs in John.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, if we did not have the signs in the Gospel of John, we would not be able to have a deep understanding of the types in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE WAY TO BE BUILT INTO THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps you are wondering how we can be built into the rebuilt temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the signs in John 2, the way we are built into the temple is through the changing of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second sign in John 2, that of the rebuilt temple, depends on the first sign, that of changing water into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If water is not changed into wine, that is, if death is not changed into life, it will be impossible for the destroyed temple to be rebuilt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Daily in the church life there may be some amount of destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without the changing of water into wine, the changing of death into life, once the church has been destroyed, there would not be a way for it to be rebuilt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the changing of death into life makes the rebuilding possible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of the changing of death into life, we are not afraid of destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church may be destroyed, but life will rebuild it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the past we have experienced destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we can praise the Lord that this destruction has brought in rebuilding by life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through the changing of death into life we have experienced the rebuilding of the destroyed temple.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many of us can testify that years ago there was much death among us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah, this death has been changed into life, and this life rebuilds the church!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Throughout the centuries, the mysteries and the signs in John have not been adequately seen by God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How we thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has removed the veils to show these things to us!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we can see things that are even deeper, richer, and more significant than what we covered in the Life-study of this Gospel.</S>
