<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</H2><P>In this message we come to the crucial point of the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the essence of all the messages given in this conference, and He is the means to bring all the realities of God's economy into our being.</P><P>God's redemption cleanses us from all our sins, and the cross eliminates all the negative things, but how can God be dispensed into man? If it is only that we are cleansed and all the negative things are removed, there is nothing for God's testimony. The Triune God has a way through the life-giving Spirit to dispense the all-inclusive Christ into all the members of His Body for the expression of the Triune God.</P><P>Without the life-giving Spirit, there could be no recovery, no local churches, and no Body of Christ. There could be only an organization with a label "the Body of Christ." But through the life-giving Spirit, who brings all the divine elements into us, the Body of Christ is a reality. Without the life-giving Spirit, there is no reality of oneness. But the more we receive the life-giving Spirit in His dispensing of Himself into us, the stronger the oneness of all the local churches will become. Today through the Spirit's dispensing, all the local churches on the whole earth are one not in the isolated way of locality but in the universal way of the Body of Christ. This is not an organizational oneness but a oneness that is the result of our contacting the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Furthermore, without the life-giving Spirit there could be no testimony of Jesus. Without the Spirit there would be nothing more than religion on the earth today. However, the Lord's recovery is not a religion; it is the testimony of Jesus. As we touch the Spirit, it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. This is the testimony of Jesus. It is not a representation of Jesus, but it is Jesus Himself living and moving in His Body.</P><P>In today's Christianity it is difficult to hear a message on the life-giving Spirit because there is very little revelation concerning the life-giving Spirit among Christians today. This revelation was not invented in the Lord's recovery. The life-giving Spirit is revealed in 1 Corinthians 15:45: "The last Adam [the Lord Jesus in the flesh] became a life-giving Spirit." Second Corinthians 3:17 also reveals that today the Lord is the Spirit. However, throughout the centuries this truth became lost to the Lord's children. The truth of justification by faith was recovered by Martin Luther, and that truth can never be lost. Through His recovery the Lord has recovered the truth that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and this truth can never be lost.</P><P>All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son. If we reject the Son, we lose everything of the Father (1 John 2:23). All that the Son is and has, has been processed to become available to us in the life-giving Spirit. In rejecting and opposing this truth, today's Christianity has lost nearly everything concerning God's economy. Because it does not fit into traditional theology, the truth of Christ being the life-giving Spirit is an offense to many Christians. Yet it is the pure revelation of the Bible. We in the recovery do not care for traditional theology. We care for Christ, and we care for life. We care for the truth that the Lord is now the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself as life to us so that we can be His Body for His testimony on the earth.</P>
