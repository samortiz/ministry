<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST<br />
AS OUR PEACE OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 3:1-5; 7:11-15, 28-34; 16:3, 5</h1>
<p>Before we get into the details of the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering, we need to see something concerning the basic divine principles. We who are believers in the Lord Jesus all know that God is our portion. He is not only our Creator, He is also our portion. In order for Him to be our portion, He has to be our life and life supply. Even He has to be everything to us. If you spend some time to cover all the sixty-six books of the Bible, you can pick up many wonderful nouns and terms and names ascribed to God. For example, God intends to be our Father, our comfort, and our encouragement. He intends to be our light, our life, our strength, our power, and even our authority.</p>
<p>In the Bible these few words are really troublesome: strength, might, power, and authority. Especially in the New Testament these four words are used. God is our strength. God is our might. God is our power. God is our authority. If you go further you would see that God is our energy. It is really difficult to define these words. It is difficult to know the difference between energy and strength, between strength and might, between might and power, between power and authority. It is really hard for people to differentiate between these terms, but the Bible has differentiated these things because God is everything to us in a detailed way.</p>
<p>God is everything to us&mdash;our clothing, our food, and even our beauty. Sisters, when you are adorning yourself, don&rsquo;t beautify yourself by other things. You have to beautify yourself by God and with God. God has to be your beauty and your glory. He also has to be your virtue. In his Epistle Peter tells us that God has called us by His glory and virtue. The preposition &ldquo;by&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;to.&rdquo; It has a double meaning. This means that God has called us by His glory and virtue to His glory and virtue. Although it may be difficult for us to understand the difference between glory and virtue, He is these two items to us. God is so many things to us.</p>
<p>But although God is so many things to us, do you know how to participate in and to enjoy God as your portion? This is a very practical matter, yet through all the generations it has been missed and lost among God&rsquo;s people. I don&rsquo;t have the assurance that many of you realize the biblical and revealed way to participate in God as our portion. Colossians 1:12 says that the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints in the light. The word portion actually means lot. When the children of Israel entered into the good land, each one was allotted a portion of land. That became his lot, his portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">POSSESSING GOD BY ENJOYING HIM</h2>
<p>God is our portion, but the poor thing is that we don&rsquo;t know how to possess the portion. Even the word possess is not adequate. Actually we don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy our portion. We may possess our portion and yet still not know how to enjoy it. For example you may possess a lot of groceries in your refrigerator, yet you don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy them. The Bible reveals to us that the real possessing is the real enjoyment. If you don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy God as your portion, you surely don&rsquo;t know how to possess God as your portion.</p>
<p>We are still fellowshipping concerning the meetings. Why have the Christian meetings all become Christian services? There is a big difference. The Christian meetings are very biblical, but the Christian services are something traditional. Christian service is not such a good term. It is a term in the degradation among today&rsquo;s Christians. When the Christian meetings degraded, they all became a kind of service. This happened because the believers didn&rsquo;t know how to enjoy God. Because they didn&rsquo;t enjoy God within them, when they came together, they came with nothing. They came empty-handed. They had God only in name. They didn&rsquo;t have the very God in reality for their enjoyment.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
