   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second item of the spiritual charter of the church is Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the negative side, the cross deals with all the negative opinions, thoughts, differing concepts, ideas, and desires and the things of the self, of the world, and of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the positive side, the cross released Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The death of the Lord was His release.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we pass through the cross, the more Christ is released.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we would learn the lessons of the cross, Christ the Lord will be much more released among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is something not negative but positive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not have regulations in letters, but we have the regulations in life, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For us all to take Christ as life and to take nothing else is a wonderful rule, regulation, and bylaw for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the sovereignty of the Lord, we have experienced this wonderful rule in recent years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nearly every time that we have come together to serve the Lord, we have experienced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be careful to check whether or not we are according to this regulation of the spiritual charter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We check ourselves by asking, "Is this something of Christ as life?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not a doctrinal matter but one that we must put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we, as the brothers and sisters who come together to practice the church life, discuss or suggest something, we must check and ask, "Lord, is this something of You?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is this something of life?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it is not of life, we drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not insist on such things; we simply drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must check ourselves by Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do this, we will save ourselves much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will not have troubles if we check ourselves by Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we pass through the cross, Christ is released as the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not have Christ as life, we do not have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church life is simply Christ realized by us in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are a group of persons who are saved, regenerated, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, coming together to experience Christ in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we suggest must be Christ Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we keep this regulation, how wonderful the church will be!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Recently, some friends have come to me and asked, "Brother Lee, what kind of regulations and rules do you have?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is hard to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would not say that we have regulations, and neither would I say that we do not have regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be sure, we have regulations, but they are not the regulations in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are the regulations in Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first regulation of the church is the cross, and the second is Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would take this word and check ourselves, others, and the entire church by these regulations, we will see how wonderful the church life will be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will save us from many things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The third item of the spiritual charter of the church is the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of life, is the living regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, there is no need for us to have regulations in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A history of the creeds of the church, containing all the different creeds since the apostolic fathers, requires several large volumes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the past years many people have asked me what kind of creed we have.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I always like to tell people that we do not have a creed; rather, we have the cross, we have Christ, and we have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are the items of the spiritual charter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to practice the church life, we need the Holy Spirit as our living creed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may claim to know the Holy Spirit as our creed more than we know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, without the cross, we may even misuse and abuse the teaching concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One aspect of the Holy Spirit in this age, or dispensation, of grace is illustrated in the holy Scriptures by the rain from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people receive the rain, but they misuse and abuse what they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we check ourselves with the cross, and we honor, magnify, exalt, and respect the Lord Jesus Christ, we are in the right position to properly experience the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must be checked by the cross, and we must be safeguarded by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we will experience the Spirit in a proper and adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit is our charter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever we come together, we must do everything in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we come to discuss something, we must discuss it in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not have the anointing Spirit within us, we should stop, be silent, and give up our idea.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there is no registration, confirmation, or seal from the Holy Spirit, we need to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In recent years, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, I have learned the lesson never to argue or quarrel with people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times people argue with me, but I ask them, "Do you have the inner anointing at this very moment while you are speaking?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This checks where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we check whether or not we have the anointing, we will know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not have the anointing, we will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are no outward regulations among us; our regulation is the cross, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not have the Spirit, we have nothing to do or to say; we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may be right in everything, but we may be short of one thing; we may be short of the Holy Spirit with the anointing.</S>
