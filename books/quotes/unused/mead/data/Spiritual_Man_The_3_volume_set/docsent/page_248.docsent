   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a believer has gone through all of the Lord's dealings, he will enter into a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This life of faith is none other than a true spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a believer arrives at this stage, he will have a life of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fire of the cross has already eliminated his greedy heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has learned his lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now he knows that only God's will is of any value; whatever else he may naturally desire is not the highest, nor do they match the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now he is happy to lose everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever the Lord thinks should be withdrawn, he gladly allows the Lord's hand to take away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sighing, bitterness, and sorrow produced from his hoping, seeking, pursuing, and struggling are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He knows that the highest life is to live for God and obey His will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although he has lost everything, he is satisfied because God's will is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although there is nothing for him to enjoy, he yields to the arranging hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It matters not what he encounters as long as God is pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is perfect rest; nothing outward can stir him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the believer is living by the will the will that is in union with God ; his will is full of the strength of the spirit which rules over his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His life is peaceful, steady, and at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The former life of ups and downs is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we should not take this to mean that he will never again be regulated by his emotion, because this kind of sinless perfection is not possible unless one enters heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we compare his present condition to the past, we can say that he is at rest and steady.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though the former confusion is definitely gone, he will occasionally be affected by his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, he needs to watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither should we think that it is no longer possible for him to feel happy or sad.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is not such a thing; unless our organ for emotion is destroyed, our feeling still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our emotion will still feel sorrow, darkness, and dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, all these only affect the outward man; it does not affect the inward man because there is a clear separation between our spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, no matter how much the soul suffers outwardly or is confused, our spirit remains peaceful and secure as though nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the believer's life reaches this stage of rest, he realizes that all the loss he suffered for the Lord before has been replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At this time, he has gained God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, everything of God is also his.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now in God, he can properly enjoy the things which He withdrew before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time, God caused him to experience sorrow and hardship because his soul-life was the mastermind in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had many loves and pursuits in himself; he even sought what was outside of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This independent action had to be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since he has lost the self and lost his soul-life, he can enjoy God's happiness in a proper position and within a proper boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only now has he learned to have a proper relationship with God's happiness in God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The heart which fervently sought things for the self is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He accepts everything which he receives with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever is not given to him, he does not demand just for the sake of happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When believers have reached this stage, they are counted as having reached a pure stage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Pureness means that there is no mixture involved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever is mixed is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the Bible, impureness is filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a believer has not yet reached this stage, he does not have a pure life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because there is mixture in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He lives for God, but he also lives for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He loves God, but he also loves himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His intention is for God, but he also has selfish motives for his own glory, happiness, and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a defiled life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He lives by faith, but he also lives by feeling; he walks according to the spirit, but he also walks according to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although the place which he reserves for himself is not big, it is enough to make his life impure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only that which is pure is clean; anything mixed with a foreign object is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a believer has gone through the thorough work of the cross, he arrives at a life of pureness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything is for God, everything is in God, and God is in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is nothing for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even the desire to make the self happy is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The self-love of the emotion has been put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His only objective in life is to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as God is pleased, nothing else matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His unique objective is to obey God; how he feels is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a pure life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although God grants him peace, comfort, and joy, he no longer enjoys these things for the sake of satisfying his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He views all things in God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His soulish life has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God has given him a spiritual life that is pure, restful, real, and trusting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God destroyed him, but God also has established him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everything soulish has been destroyed; everything spiritual has been established.</S>
