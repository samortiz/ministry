   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST INTRODUCED OUTSIDE OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew chapter 3 relates to us the principle of the introducing of Christ this also is absolutely outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John the Baptist was the one who recommended Christ to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was born a priest, but he would not remain in the priesthood, he would not stay in the temple or even in the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We read that he was in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He stayed in a wild place, and even he himself became wild.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He wore camel's hair.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The camel, according to Leviticus chapter 11, was an unclean animal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But John said in effect, "You say, according to your religious regulation, that the camel is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then I must be such a camel!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John acted in a way radically opposed to religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And consider his diet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He ate wild honey and locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had no religion, and he had no culture; he was versus religion, and he was versus human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was not in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had no altar to offer sacrifices, he had nothing related to religion or even to human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not long ago in Los Angeles a brother came to the meetings wearing a blanket.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This blanket was a real test to some of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But John the Baptist wore camel's hair.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blanket was cultured, treated, and made with human hands, but the camel's hair worn by John the Baptist was absolutely raw.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was wild; he was really wild.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the pioneer, the forerunner of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was he who stood there and, seeing Christ coming, exclaimed to the people, "Behold, the Lamb of God."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was he who said that he saw the Spirit as a dove descending from heaven upon Christ, and he knew that it was He who would baptize in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What can we say?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said nothing about the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He gave that up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said, "Behold the Lamb of God."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He pointed to the One who would baptize in the Holy Spirit, and he said, "Repent!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John did not teach people about religion he called on them to repent, to change their mind, to change their concept about religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not tell them to do something, he baptized them, he buried them, he terminated them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John said, "I baptize you in water, but He that comes after me will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus was recommended in such a wild way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Would you believe?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Would you take it?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was recommended by a wild person in a wild way with nothing to do with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah for John the Baptist!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was really good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CHRIST FOLLOWED</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OUTSIDE OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matthew 4 tells us that after Jesus was introduced, there were some dear ones who followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who were they?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The high priests?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The scribes?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No. They were the Galilean fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some were fishing in the sea, others were mending their nets they were unlearned people, but they followed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And they began to follow not in Jerusalem, not in the temple, and not even in the Holy Land, but in Galilee, a place then considered as "of the Gentiles" Matt 4: 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You see, the birth of Christ, the finding of Christ, the introducing of Christ, and the following of Christ were entirely apart from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then, Hallelujah, Jesus came: He not only came in His birth, but He also came of age; He came forth to minister, He presented Himself to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was there; He came to the people; there was no need to go and find Him.</S>
