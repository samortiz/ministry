<h2 class=head2>Feeding the New Believers Regularly in Their Homes</h2><p>After we baptize new believers, we should return to their homes to have home meetings. The home meetings should be in the new ones’ homes; we must go to them to feed them. When we have two or three new ones, we can stop visiting sinners for a while and spend all our time feeding the new ones. We should always have two or three new ones under our care. Some among these new ones will move away, and we will not have the way to take some of them on with the Lord. If this happens, we must go out again to find someone else.<h2 class=head2>Perfecting the Saints in Group Meetings</h2><p>After feeding and nourishing the new believers, we should bring them to the group meetings. We perfect the saints in the group meetings not according to the old way with regulation or formality, but according to the new way which is full of the Spirit, life, singing, and praising. In the group meetings, there should be fellowship of each one’s up-to-date incidents (Heb. 10:24-25). It may be that after meeting in the Lord’s recovery for several years, we still do not know each other’s situation. We have to keep our fellowship up-to-date. The only way to do this is in the group meetings. In the group meetings, we should open up to one another. When someone opens up his situation, the others in the meeting can pray for him. In this way, everyone’s situation is known to the others. The mutual fellowship issues in the need to mutually intercede for one another. Out of this mutual intercession comes mutual care and mutual shepherding.<p>The group meetings should also have mutual questions and mutual answers to carry out the mutual teaching for the perfecting of one another (Eph. 4:12). In the past the elders may have divided the saints into group meetings and assigned a leader to be the teacher in each group meeting. That way was not profitable, and we have given it up. The group meetings should have no assigned teacher. Everyone is a teacher, and everyone is a learner. Everyone can ask, and everyone can answer.<p>When we come together in the group meetings, we may firstly fellowship about our present situations. Then we will intercede for one another, care for one another, and shepherd one another. Then we must take care of the teaching, the perfecting. The new ones may not know how to ask the proper questions, but we should not teach them. Rather, we should simply take the lead to ask something for their sake. Then the others will answer, and everyone will learn. After twenty minutes of answers from everyone, the question will have been adequately covered. Spontaneously, there will be the perfecting. This is the proper teaching. In this way, everyone in the meeting will become interested in asking and in answering questions. This way of teaching will cover many subjects throughout the year. After fifty meetings in a year, everyone will have received fifty teachings. After meeting in this way for two years, the new ones will surely know how to speak for the Lord, and everyone in the group meeting will be perfected.<p>For the sake of the group meetings, we must pick up the burden to learn the truth. We have many publications covering many subjects, such as justification by faith, baptism, reconciliation, and forgiveness of sins. We must learn from these in order to equip ourselves with the adequate knowledge of the truth. When a question is raised in a group meeting, no one may be able to answer it adequately. In this case someone can give a longer answer that covers the subject in a good way. Then all the attendants will learn, and no group meeting will ever be in vain. All the attendants can carry out this kind of perfecting. After meeting in this way, all the newly perfected ones will be able to speak for the Lord in the church meetings.<h2 class=head2>Prophesying for the Building Up of the Church as the Organic Body of Christ</h2><p>All of us need to prophesy in the church meetings for the building up of the local churches that the organic Body of Christ might be built up universally for the fulfillment of God’s New Testament economy (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23a, 24, 26, 31; Eph. 4:12, 16; 3:8-10). The prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is defined in verse 3: “But he who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation.” The prophesying that builds up the Body of Christ is either to build others up or to render encouragement or consolation. To speak building up, encouragement, and consolation is not to predict. Prophesying in this way is not a miraculous gift. Learning is needed for our prophesying (1 Cor. 14:31), but to predict miraculously or to speak in tongues does not require learning.<p>In order to prophesy for the building up of the church, we must learn much. When Mary, the Lord’s mother, visited Elizabeth, they prophesied one to another (Luke 1:42-45, 46-55). Mary’s prophecy consisted almost entirely of quotations from the Old Testament. This indicates that Mary was very well acquainted with the Word of God and had learned much. In today’s Christianity it is difficult to find the proper prophesying. The learned pastors, preachers, and ministers who have studied in seminaries have become the professional speakers. Many Christians do not know how to speak for the Lord because they have never learned or practiced.<p>We should take the lead to practice the God-ordained way in a local church. Then we can help others to take this way. We want to cooperate with the Lord to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ and to experience Christ as life and everything as a testimony of God’s economy. We must also have the universal service with every member functioning in the practice of the God-ordained way.
