<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP<br />
CONCERNING DOOR-KNOCKING<br />
AND HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we look to You and ask You to take us through this crucial stage. Give us an inward sense related to how we should proceed with the home meetings and the church meetings so that we can be clear and have the same burden. Lord, give us an open spirit so that we can enter into and touch Your feeling. Thank You for being within us as the Spirit. We are one with You in our spirit. Lord, speak through every person during this time of fellowship so that we can touch Your heart&rsquo;s intention and Your way in our fellowship. May Your presence lead us. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN OPENING WORD</h2>
<p>During two terms of the full-time training more than twenty thousand people were brought into the church in Taipei. One-third of these people are in home meetings; about six thousand people are in at least two thousand home meetings. Presently, the responsibility for caring for these two thousand home meetings rests on the shoulders of six or seven hundred trainees. Almost every day these trainees go to several different homes to care for new ones. However, this term of training will end, and some of the trainees will return to their localities while others will return for another term of the training. Hence, the saints need to take over the care of these homes. I am afraid that the saints in the church in Taipei are not prepared to care for these two thousand home meetings. We need to fellowship concerning this matter.</p>
<p>We gained these new ones and their homes by mobilizing one thousand trainees during two terms of the full-time training. We did not spare time or money in this effort. Who will continue to feed these new ones? The church in Taipei has picked up this burden, and according to our statistics the church has around one thousand five hundred saints attending the training; one thousand are from the city of Taipei, and around five hundred are from the nearby suburbs as far as Taoyuan. We must ask all the brothers and sisters who have heard this fellowship what they intend to do. Since we began to change the system, we have stressed the homes. We said that the Lord&rsquo;s way is in the homes and that the homes are the foundation of the church. During two years of door-knocking, six to seven hundred trainees were busy taking care of homes every day. We discovered that it is not easy to care for the home meetings. How should we proceed?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER USE OF<br />
THE GOD-CREATED HUMAN NATURE</h2>
<p>God created man with many needs. These needs are a part of human nature. Man has a nature that needs to eat and to drink and a nature that delights in doing good works. Man also has a communal nature that enjoys being with other humans; therefore, after people are married, they want children. Having children satisfies an inner need of man. However, even a family is not sufficient; man still needs friends. Man also desires pleasure. People go to places of entertainment to satisfy their human need for companionship. If human beings did not have a communal nature, there would be no need for the places of entertainment.</p>
<p>Human nature was created by God, but it is not easy to respond to our human nature properly. For example, it is not easy for a person to be balanced rather than excessive when he eats. Almost everyone makes mistakes in the matter of eating. People become ill because of their improper response to their desire for food. It is not wrong to eat and drink, but it is wrong to abuse this need. This also applies to man&rsquo;s communal nature. Man needs companions, but the wrong companions can bring a person into different sins. The corrupt things in society are mainly the result of keeping improper companions. There is, however, a noble community in human society, and this community is the church. The church is the noblest community, because the Lord, who is holy, is in the church.</p>
<p>The church life ordained by the Lord is founded upon the home meetings. The home meetings can be compared to eating at home and the big meetings, to eating in a restaurant. When we go to a restaurant, we do not need to work; we simply enjoy. However, people who frequently eat in restaurants are not very healthy. In contrast, food that is prepared at home may not be spicy, but it is healthier. Just as people prefer to eat in restaurants, Christians like to go to big meetings in cathedrals. These meetings can be compared to eating in a restaurant because a person does not need to cook for himself. In the cathedrals there are choirs, prayer ministers, and a minister who gives the blessing; hence, the people do not need to expend any energy. Such a gathering meets the demands of society today. In today&rsquo;s society everyone is busy from morning to night and works five or six days a week. Therefore, they want to sleep late and relax on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. When they go to worship services, the ministers and preachers do everything for them, and they only need to put money in the collection plate. Consequently, everyone likes to attend worship services.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, even though we are taking the Lord&rsquo;s way, we still want to rest on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, contrary to our expectations we are required to function in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings by prophesying. In addition, we must take the church meetings to the homes of the new believers, and everyone in our home is expected to meet. In our hearts we prefer the big meetings because we do not need to speak, pray, or even sing hymns in the big meetings; we can simply sit and enjoy. However, the home meetings are different because we must do everything ourselves in these meetings. The Lord&rsquo;s church has almost no way on this earth, because everyone likes and welcomes the big meetings.</p>
<p>After many years of observation and research, we discovered that in almost every denominational group everyone likes the big meetings. We need to have meetings, but our meetings should be proper. We should gather together to enjoy the big meetings and also the small meetings in the homes. Even though we enjoy eating in restaurants, we must still eat at home.</p>
<p>It is not easy to build up the home meetings according to the Lord&rsquo;s word, because we like the big meetings. We have been meeting in the homes for the past few months, but we still like the big meetings, even though we are bound and our function is annulled in these meetings. For many years we invited people to meetings and preached the gospel to them, but the little fruit that we gained did not remain. This problem is an issue of the big meetings. If we want to solve such problems, we must rely on the small meetings in the homes. However, it is not easy to establish the home meetings, and it is difficult to develop them.</p>
<p>A new believer who has a weekly meeting in his home needs to clean his home and dress neatly for the meeting. On the days that he does not have a meeting in his home, he may be careless with his clothing and watch television, but he cannot be loose on the day of his home meeting. The home meeting will restrict him. When the meeting is in the meeting hall, there are no restrictions on him. He can go to the meetings when he wants to and stay at home when it is not convenient. He is free. This is human nature.</p>
<p>For this reason, we need to properly respond to our God-created nature. A person who properly responds to his human nature pays a price. When we accommodate our human nature, we are loose. The home meetings meet the need of our communal nature, but we must pay a price to respond to our communal nature properly.</p>
<p>In a normal family a person eats three home-cooked meals a day, and parents teach and discipline their children at home. If a household is proper, all the members of that family will be healthy. Some families, however, eat out every day, and the children are not disciplined. The children in these families will be unruly.</p>
