   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRESENT ADVANCE OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the divine revelation was completed within the first century, but the truths of the divine revelation were soon lost as the church degraded throughout its history.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever we are seeing today is not something new but ancient.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was with the saints nearly two thousand years ago, but it got lost throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We call the scriptural way to practice the Lord s present recovery the new way because it is new to us, but in fact it is the ancient way to which we must return.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through century after century the Lord has been recovering item after item, and He is still going on among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In August of 1988 the Lord passed on the words organic and organism to us in order to advance His recovery even further.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In September in Cleveland, Ohio a series of messages were released entitled The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our eyes need to be opened to see what the Lord is recovering in the present advance of His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be impressed with three major items.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Recovering the Organic Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the Lord is moving to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This organic building can be seen in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul tells us that the church is built up with precious materials, and among these precious materials are the precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Physical stones are lifeless, inorganic, and a building made of these stones is inorganic.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in 1 Peter 2:5, Peter tells us that we are living stones, stones that are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s building is organic because all the stones are living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter says that as living stones, we are being built up into a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since God s building is a living building, Paul tells us in Ephesians 2:21 that it is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can illustrate the difference between an inorganic item and something organic by comparing a piece of wood to a person s finger.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a piece of wood is cut in half, and the pieces are put together without any glue, they will remain separate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if a person s finger is cut in half, and a doctor puts the two pieces together, they will grow together because they are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their coming together is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we are organic members of the Body of Christ, our building together is totally organic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have not seen much of the organic building among us because we have not taken the organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The old, traditional, and unscriptural way is good for organization but not for the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is good for the organizational building but not for the organic building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some who are opposing the Lord s present advance in His recovery have said that I have deviated from the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have not deviated from the Lord s recovery, but I have surely deviated from the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My deviation from the old way has brought me more into the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today I am in the Lord s recovery more than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sixty-one years ago in 1927, I officially left my denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That was the initiation of my deviation from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to my feeling, my deviation from Christianity was fully completed in August of 1988.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now that the old way is being annulled, some older co-workers have to consider where they shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Should they remain in the old way or go forth into the new way?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To go forth into the new way, we have to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some older co-workers were a success in the recovery according to the old way, but now the old way is being annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the root of all the troubles among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the other things are on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I must testify that instead of deviating from the Lord s recovery, I have entered into the Lord s recovery more deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Much of what we carried out in the past according to the old way was organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some of it was organic, but the main situation of our practice was not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today the Lord wants us to be absolutely organic in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wants to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord does not want to build up a congregation but an organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would like to check with the elders in the local churches whether the local church in your locality is just a congregation or a part of the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The difference between an organization and an organism can be illustrated by comparing a robot to our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A robot is an organization of inorganic parts, but our human body, which typifies the Body of Christ, is altogether organic.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church in our locality may be mostly congregational instead of organic.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to deviate from the organizational and congregational way into something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need such a deviation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is not only by the gifted persons but also by every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must admit that in many of the local churches, the building up has been mostly by the elders and the co-workers, the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may say that we do not agree with the clergy-laity system and that among us in the Lord s recovery, we do not have the class of the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually, though, we have to admit that there has been a strong clerical class in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some among us have been the clergy and many have been the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In his epistle to the church in Ephesus in the book of Revelation, the Lord revealed that He hates the clergy-laity system 2:6 and note 1 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I went back to Taipei in 1984, there were about three thousand saints attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of these, only about one hundred were serving.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There were about five serving ones in each of the twenty-one halls.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unconsciously there was a strong clergy among us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may say that we do not have a clergy, but in fact we have had it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I took note of many of the saints who were brought into the Lord s recovery when we began the Lord s work there thirty-five years ago in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I checked with them whether or not they could speak a word for the Lord on certain truths such as reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>None of them said they could do this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Actually, a small number of the saints were in the clerical class and the rest had become the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The clergy-laity system is what the Lord hates, and yet we have practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Should we not deviate from such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all have to rise up and say, Lord, we want to deviate from this system that You hate.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We want to build up Your Body, not only by a few gifted ones but also by every member of Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The building up of the Body of Christ is not in the organizational way but in the organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The organic building up of the Body of Christ must be the first item that the Lord desires to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I believe that the Lord is earnestly after this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He desires to see His Body being built up organically on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This must be absolutely recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we mean business with the Lord that we love Him, we have to rise up for this organic building.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to tell the Lord: Lord, You hate the clergy-laity system and so do I. I do not want to remain in this system anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I want to get out of this system.</S>
