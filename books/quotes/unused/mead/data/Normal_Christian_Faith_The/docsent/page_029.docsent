   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO NEED TO REPENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every philosopher or founder of religion, at one time or another, has said, "I repent," or "I regret such and such a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I will do better from now on."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Jesus of Nazareth never repented.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A sinner must of necessity repent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what does a sinless man have to repent of?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus never apologized to anyone; He never did anyone any wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was in England, some British friends asked for my opinion concerning their people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I said, "Among you, once ever so often, I hear, 'Excuse me' and 'I beg your pardon.'"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To the English, anyone who does not know how to make these two remarks has to be an extremely base person, for he knows not his own mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anyone can make a mistake, but when one refuses to admit his mistakes, he makes himself vulgar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason we have to say, "Excuse me" and "I beg your pardon" all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The amazing thing is that Jesus of Nazareth never said "sorry" to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He never apologized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Could He be so evil as to ignore His conscience completely?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Was He oblivious to His own errors?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Or is He really sinless?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If so, He cannot say, "sorry."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a matter of humility or politeness to Him, but a matter of maintaining His standing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TOUCHING AND NOT PRESSING</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I love the story about Jesus once walking down a road.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people were gathered around Him, hoping to see the resurrection of a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was so crowded that the people pressed upon each other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One woman, who suffered from an issue of blood for years, thought that Jesus would surely be able to heal her since He had performed all kinds of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She did not come to the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that she did was touch the fringe of His garment, and the sickness was immediately healed Mark 5:25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus felt something, turned around, and asked, "Who touched Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How did the disciples respond?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They said, "You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?" v. 31 . He should have asked, "Who pressed Me?" instead of "Who touched Me?" If I were Jesus, I would have said in a gentlemanly fashion, "Excuse me." But Jesus did not need to say that.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He said that it was a touch, He meant that it was a touch and not a pressing against.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The disciples only knew that many thronged around Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But He knew that someone "touched" Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He knew what He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was no need for apology.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He knows no sin because He is without sin.</S>
