   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY TWO PERSONS WITH ONE LIFE AND ONE LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is difficult to explain our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For many years I have considered what the nature of the Christian life is and how it can be described.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is it a human or a divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our previous message we likened it to marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in marriage the wife does not have her husband's life; thus, this illustration is faulty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father and the Son had only one life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What Christ has as life is the life of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ethical relationships described in Ephesians 5 and 6 cannot be worked out in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot carry out these relationships by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may have thought before that we could, but actually it is beyond our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Does this mean that whatever the Bible tells us to do is in vain?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No, but we cannot fulfill its exhortations in and of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The love in Ephesians 5, for example, does not come from us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ has to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>SOME WRONG CONCEPTS OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians are still under the natural concept that now that they are Christians they must improve their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This concept of seeking to live the way God's children should live must be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basic revelation in the Bible is that you must take Christ as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are to do this not because you are evil, or weak, or defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ took the Father's life not because His own life was weak but in order to fulfill the Father's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me" John 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It may sound like Christian teaching to say that you need another life because your own life is inadequate, but actually such a teaching is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if you have the best life, God does not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if you can put Satan under your feet, God is not interested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God wants Christ to be lived out by you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE WAY CHRIST LIVED</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How many times we have read or recited this verse!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Notice that there is no mention of weakness, sin, or better behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is simply the desire of the living Father to live in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why did this living Father send the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was not to establish an empire but to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To live by the Father was the Father's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus did not accomplish any impressive work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He merely lived a life to express the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"So he who eats Me" tells us that the Lord wants to be eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I did not see this until 1958, some thirty-three years after I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the spring of 1958 I gave three consecutive conferences in Taipei on the eating of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The messages were new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the first meeting, a brother who was a professor came to me, protesting that to use the words "eat Jesus" was too barbarous and uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My reply was that this term was not initiated by me but by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was He who said "he who eats Me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I told the brother to drop his cultural mentality and come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord's concern is for our eating of Him, not for the dictates of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your life must be Christ, and Christ must be your life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To try to improve your behavior is of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Son came not to live Himself, but to live the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jesus came, not primarily to save sinners, but to fulfill the Father's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was for this purpose that He went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the cross had not been the Father's will, Christ would not have accepted it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You remember His prayer in Gethsemane, "Not as I will, but as You will" Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He came not to seek His own will, but the will of Him who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That He went to the cross to save sinners was to do the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Son did not live another life of His own.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Though He and the Father were two Persons, They had only one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The same should be true of us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Though we and the Lord are two, we should not have two lives, nor should we have two livings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The one life that we both have is His, but the living is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our living must be by His life, expressing Him, not ourselves.</S>
