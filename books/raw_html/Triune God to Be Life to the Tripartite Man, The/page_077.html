<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT<br>OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD BEING<br>THE REALITY OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>The consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God is the reality of the processed Triune God. The phrase "consummated Spirit" indicates that some processes have taken place. The processes which the Triune God passed through include incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Before incarnation He was only divine not human. Through incarnation He became both human and divine. He was further processed through human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Through all of these processes, the Triune God was consummated. Today the consummated Spirit is the reality of the processed Triune God. If we want to have God or Christ, we must have the Spirit. God and Christ are mere terms to us if we do not have the Spirit. Without the Spirit, Jesus would merely be a historical person to us. The reality of Christ and of God is the Spirit. For this reason, John 14:17 calls the Spirit "the Spirit of reality."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT AS THE AGGREGATE<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br>BEING THE REALITY OF CHRIST</H2><P>The Spirit as the aggregate of the Divine Trinity is the reality of Christ (John 14:16-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT<br>AS THE COMPOUND SPIRIT COMPOUNDED<br>WITH CHRIST'S PERSON AND DEATH<br>BEING THE REALITY OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST</H2><P>The consummated Spirit as the compound Spirit compounded with Christ's person and death is the reality of the death of Christ (Rom. 8:13b). If you do not have the Spirit, you do not have the reality of the death of Christ. The death of Christ is fully unveiled in Romans 6, and the Spirit of Christ is unveiled in Romans 8. It is in the Spirit of Christ that you find the death of Christ. Brother Nee once said that you can never experience Romans 6 without the experience of the Spirit in Romans 8. The life-giving Spirit is the reality of the death of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT<br>AS THE COMPOUND SPIRIT COMPOUNDED<br>WITH CHRIST'S PERSON AND RESURRECTION<br>BEING THE REALITY<br>OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</H2><P>The consummated Spirit as the compound Spirit compounded with Christ's person and resurrection is the reality of the resurrection of Christ. Today's modern antibiotics contain elements which kill certain germs and supply certain nutrients. The Spirit today is like an all-inclusive dose. The Spirit is the reality of God, the reality of Christ, the reality of Christ's death, and the reality of Christ's resurrection. The reality of God, Christ, and the death and resurrection of Christ is the Spirit. This Spirit is the compound Spirit, the consummated Spirit as the aggregate of the processed Triune God, the reality of the processed Triune God.</P>
