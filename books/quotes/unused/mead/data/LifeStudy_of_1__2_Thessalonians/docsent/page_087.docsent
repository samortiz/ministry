   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SANCTIFIED AND PRESERVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God not only sanctifies us wholly, but also preserves our spirit, soul, and body complete.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Wholly" is quantitative; "complete" is qualitative.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In quantity God sanctifies us wholly; in quality God preserves us complete; that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through the fall our body has been ruined, our soul has been contaminated, and our spirit has been deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God's full salvation, our entire being is saved and made complete and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this, God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element Heb 9:14 , our soul from remaining natural and old Matt 16:24-26 , and our body from the ruin of sin 1 Thes 4:4; Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a preservation by God and His thorough sanctification sustain us to live a holy life unto maturity that we may meet the Lord in His parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO CONTACT GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our spirit is composed of three parts: the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our spirit is mainly for us to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we have fellowship with God, we contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This contact with God spontaneously gives us a sense of God, a consciousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Intuition denotes the direct sense and consciousness that come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through this intuition we can know whether we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are wrong, we shall be condemned by our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we are right, we shall be justified by our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our conscience, therefore, either accuses and condemns or excuses and justifies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way to preserve our spirit is first to exercise it to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we fail to exercise our spirit in this way, we shall leave it in a deadened situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever we Christians come together in a church meeting, we need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to pray, praise, or give a word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to exercise our spirit and not allow it to remain dormant or in a deadened condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But sorry to say, many saints do not preserve their spirit by exercising it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, they allow their spirit to remain dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that they leave their spirit in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, there are some brothers who disturb the meeting by functioning too frequently without any real riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Again and again they stand up to speak without having anything to say.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I would encourage brothers such as these to be silent for a period of time until they have the assurance that some of the riches of Christ have truly become their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they stand up to release these riches, all the saints will be happy with them because their testimony will be helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although some saints may function too much without the riches of Christ, the need of most of the saints is to function much more with the exercise of their spirit.</S>
