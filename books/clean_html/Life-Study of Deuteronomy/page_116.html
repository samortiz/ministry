<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE WORD OF MOSES<br>AND JOSHUA TO THE PEOPLE</H2><P>Deuteronomy 32:44-47 is the word of Moses and Joshua to the people. Moses and Joshua spoke to the people all the words of this song (vv. 44-45). Moses said to them that they should set their heart on all these words and command their children to do all the words of this law (v. 46). He told them that it was not a matter too vain for them, because it was their life and by it they would extend their days upon the land into which they were crossing over the Jordan to possess it (v. 47).</P><P>Everything which Moses spoke in the book of Deuteronomy was an expression of his concern for the children of Israel. The rehearsal of the law, the warning, the enactment of the covenant, the final exhortations and charges, and the song of Moses&#151;all were spoken by Moses out of his concern for God's people. His greatest concern was that they would turn away from their God and go after other gods. And this is what the children of Israel have done throughout the centuries. Even today, many of them have turned away from God to the idols of money, high technology, weapons, and skill in fighting. Therefore, on the one hand, God is working for the children of Israel to protect them. On the other hand, because they have not yet repented and returned to God, He is also judging them.</P>
