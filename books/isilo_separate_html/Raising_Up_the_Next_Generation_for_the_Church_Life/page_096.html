<p>I hope that there will be a genuine revival among us by our receiving this burden of shepherding. If all the churches receive this teaching to participate in Christ&rsquo;s wonderful shepherding, there will be a big revival in the recovery. In the past we did much speaking and teaching with very little shepherding. Shepherding and teaching should be like two feet for our move with the Lord. Our shepherding should always be with teaching, and our teaching should always be with shepherding.</p>
<p>We have seen from our crystallization-study of the Gospel of John that its last chapter, John 21, reveals the apostolic ministry in cooperation with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry. In His heavenly ministry Christ is shepherding people, and we need to cooperate with Him by shepherding people. Without shepherding, our work for the Lord cannot be effective. We must learn all the truths so that we may have something to speak and go to contact people to shepherd them. (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> p. 40)</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMMISSIONING PETER TO FEED HIS LAMBS<br />
AND SHEPHERD HIS SHEEP</h2>
<p>When the Lord stayed with His disciples after His resurrection and before His ascension, in one of His appearings, He commissioned Peter to feed His lambs and shepherd His sheep in His absence, while He is in the heavens (John 21:15-17). Shepherding implies feeding, but it includes much more than feeding. To shepherd is to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock. (<em>Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John,</em> p. 131)</p>

<p>In order to take care of the church properly, the elders have to receive this charge from the Lord. They must shepherd the saints conscientiously. The Lord asked Peter in John chapter 21, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; Peter answered the Lord, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, You know that I love You.&rdquo; Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Feed My lambs&rdquo; (v. 15). To feed is to nourish others with the riches of the inner life. This is a mouth-to-mouth feeding. The second time, the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Shepherd My sheep&rdquo; (v. 16). To shepherd the sheep is to take care of all the needs of the sheep. The third time, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Feed My sheep&rdquo; (v. 17). At the time the Lord said this to Peter, Peter had been following the Lord for over three years. After His resurrection, the Lord charged him especially with this matter of shepherding the sheep. This shows how important it is to shepherd the sheep. Later, when Peter wrote his first Epistle, he entreated the elders to shepherd the flock of God (1 Pet. 5:1-2).</p>
<p>Shepherding refers to caring for all of the needs of the sheep, whether the need is grass, water, or shelter. All the sheep are to be well provided for and well tended to. Of all the needs, the most important one is the feeding, that is, the mouth-to-mouth feeding. This is the duty of the elders. If all the elders in the various localities would do this, the saints would receive the suitable care. In the past, we baptized many but brought in few. The reason for this was the lack of feeding and care. Our messages were high and deep, but after the messages there was not much care. In the end, the flock was without shepherds. There was preaching without shepherding and teaching without feeding. This was our shortcoming in the past. Among us there is the begetting and the teaching, but there is a lack of feeding. As soon as a baby is born, what he needs most is feeding. A baby will not grow just by teaching him. (<em>A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need,</em> pp. 52-53)</p>

<p>In his first Epistle, Peter spoke in 2:25 of Christ being the Shepherd and Overseer of our soul, our inner being and real person. Then in 5:1-2 he told the elders that their obligation is to shepherd God&rsquo;s flock according to God. <em>According to God</em> means that we must live God. We must have God on hand. We have God in our understanding, in our theology, and in our teaching, but we may not live God when we are shepherding people. When we are one with God, we become God. Then we have God and are God in our shepherding of others. To shepherd according to God is to shepherd according to what God is in His attributes. God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. <em>According to God</em> is at least according to these four attributes of God. We must shepherd the young ones, the weak ones, and the backsliding ones according to these four attributes. Then we will be good shepherds.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARRYING OUT<br />
HIS SHEPHERDING OF HIS FLOCK</h2>
<p>In addition to the shepherding by the main function of the gifted persons, Christ as the Head of the church also charged the apostles to appoint elders (overseers) in all the local churches to carry out His shepherding of His flock (1 Tim. 3:1-7; 5:17a). The Head of the church gave many gifted persons to function in shepherding for the building up of His Body, but the Body is manifested in the local churches. The Body is universal and abstract, but the churches are located and substantial. In the local churches, the elders as the local shepherds are needed. The local shepherds are more practical. Christ as the Head of the church charged the apostles, the universal shepherds, to appoint some local elders to take care of the located churches. (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> pp. 60-61, 63)</p>

<p>First Peter 5:2a says, &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God.&rdquo; To shepherd according to God means according to God&rsquo;s nature, desire, way, and glory, not according to man&rsquo;s preference, interest, and purpose. The elders should not shepherd the flock according to their opinion, concepts, or likes or dislikes. Instead, they should shepherd according to God&rsquo;s choice, desire, intention, and preference. The elders must shepherd the saints as the flock of God altogether according to God&rsquo;s thought, feeling, will, and choice. They must shepherd according to God&rsquo;s likes and dislikes.
