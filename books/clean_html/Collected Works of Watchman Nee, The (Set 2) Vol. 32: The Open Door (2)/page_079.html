<h2 class="head2">Chi-Shien-Chiao, Pu-Tung, Kiangsu Province</h2><p>Mr. Cheng-hwa in the Lord!</p><p>By the Lord's grace, He has sent Brother Chang Yu-zhi to our conference. How blessed we are. Brother Chang delivered messages concerning the importance and difference between the salvation of the spirit, soul, and body. The conference lasted from January 27 to February 5. Every day we had over seventy people. In the last meeting the Lord gave us a great release. May glory be to God. Peace to you in the Lord and peace to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Feng Mei-lin, Chu En-seng, Yang Chun-lin, February 8</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Our meeting moved to its new address on October 24. We can only say that everything that happened before was God's work; man did not try to do anything. Everything here is good. Brother Tang gave us much help during this period. May the Lord reward him much on that day. There was a conference from October 24-30. Brother Tang was responsible. Praise the Lord that He has blessed His own work. The brothers and sisters were all edified, and the number in attendance was great.</p><p>Because of the peculiar situation here, we feel that workers should be stationed here all the time. We have Brother Tang's approval and have written to Brother Stephen Kaung, inviting him to come and work among us and to shepherd us. We have not received an answer from Brother Kaung yet. May God lead him to us soon. Please pray about this. Presently, the house where the meetings are held belongs to Brother Luk. In order to facilitate the negotiation of affairs related to the meeting, it became necessary to ask Brother Luk to be responsible for the affairs of the church. Later, we were given the consent of Brother Tang to ask Brother Luk to take up this responsibility. We would like you to know that there are now five responsible brothers. May the Lord be with you and bless your work. If the Lord delays His coming, we will surely have opportunity to see each other again. Please do not forget to pray for us. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Brothers Mei Tui-an, Lee Yun-sien, Liu Kwo-hwa,<br />Ge Shien-shen, Luk Tsi-shun, November 3</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother Shou-ling in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord that I, who drifted away in 1938, am now back in the Father's house. When I was in Hankow, you exhorted me twice in the name of the Lord, but I was still stubborn. However, God's love was upon me, and I would like to relate what happened. In December of last year, I was busy with my own business and with the world. Sometimes I had to work late and did not get home until two or three o'clock in the morning. On the night of December 26, I could not sleep, and on the morning of the twenty-seventh, I realized that I had a fever. By the afternoon, the fever was higher. My whole body was weak with chills. Fortunately, two brothers in my house were doctors. Another brother next door was also a doctor. They diagnosed that I was infected with some kind of virus, and they suggested that I rest for two weeks. While I was laying on my bed, the Lord continued to send those who were His to come and visit me. His love was displayed at every minute. Our God is worthy of praise and thanksgiving. On the afternoon of the thirtieth, one brother came to visit me, and we prayed together. While I was praying, my body was numb and my chest was pressed with unspeakable weight. It was painful. The faith given by God enabled us to pray. When we stopped our prayer, my faith led me to measure my temperature because I believed that God had healed me. When I measured it, I found that my lingering temperature was gone. The terrible virus had left. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Brother, my past stubbornness truly offended God and the brothers and sisters, as well as my whole family. May the Lord forgive me again because of His beloved Son Christ! I wish you well, and may peace be unto your house.</p><p>Brother Yuen How-tsai, January 2, 1939</p>
