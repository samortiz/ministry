   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some may ask: Why doesn't God Himself cast Satan into the bottomless pit or the lake of fire?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our answer is: God can do it, but He does not want to do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not know why He will not do it Himself, but we do know how He is going to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God wants to use man to deal with His enemy, and He created man for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God wants the creature to deal with the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wants His creature man to deal with His fallen creature Satan in order to bring the earth back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The man whom He created is being used by Him for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us read Genesis 1:26 again: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems that the sentence is finished here, but another phrase is added: "...and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see that the creeping things occupy a very great position, for God spoke of it after He finished mentioning "all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The implication is that in order for man to have dominion over all the earth, the creeping things must not be overlooked, for God's enemy is embodied in the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The serpent in Genesis 3 and the scorpions in Luke 10 are creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only is there the serpent, representing Satan, but also scorpions, representing the sinful and unclean evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The domain of both the serpent and the scorpion is this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problem is on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we must distinguish the difference between the work of saving souls and the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times the work of saving souls is not necessarily the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Saving souls solves the problem of man, but the work of God requires that man exercise authority to have dominion over all things created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God needs an authority in His creation, and He has chosen man to be that authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we were here just for ourselves as mere men, then all our seeking and longing would be to love the Lord more and to be more holy, more zealous, and save more souls.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of these pursuits are good indeed, but they are too man-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These things are concerned simply with the benefit of man; God's work and God's need are entirely neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must see that God has His need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are on this earth not merely for man's need but even more for God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank God that He has committed the ministry of reconciliation to us, but even if we have saved all the souls in the whole world, we have not yet accomplished God's work or satisfied God's requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here is something called God's work, God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God created man, He spoke of what He needed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He revealed His need to have man rule and reign over all His creation and proclaim His triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ruling for God is not a small thing; it is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God needs men whom He can trust and who will not fail Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is God's work, and this is what God desires to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not lightly esteem the work of gospel preaching, but if all our work is just preaching the gospel and saving souls, we are not causing Satan to suffer fatal loss.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If man has not restored the earth from the hand of Satan, he has not yet achieved God's purpose in creating him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Saving souls is often only for the welfare of man, but dealing with Satan is for the benefit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Saving souls solves man's need, but dealing with Satan satisfies God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, this requires us to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know how the demons can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A demon once said, "Jesus I know of, and with Paul I am acquainted; but who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Acts 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a demon meets us, will he flee or not?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Preaching the gospel demands that we pay a price, but a much greater price must be paid to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not a matter of a message or a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This requires our practice, and the price is extremely great.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are to be men whom God will use to overthrow all of Satan's work and authority, we must obey the Lord completely and absolutely!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In doing other work it matters less if we preserve ourselves a little, but when dealing with Satan, we cannot leave one bit of ground for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may hold on to something of ourselves in our study of the Scriptures, in preaching the gospel, in helping the church or the brothers, but when we are dealing with Satan, self must be utterly abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan will never be moved by us if self is preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May God open our eyes to see that His purpose demands that we be wholly and absolutely for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A double-minded person can never deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May God speak this word to our hearts.</S>
