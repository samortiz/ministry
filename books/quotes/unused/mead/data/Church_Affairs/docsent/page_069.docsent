   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need to Have Two to Handle the Money</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I personally believe that in every region there should be at least two persons to handle the money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The principle in the Bible is always to have two.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first time it was Barnabas and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Subsequently, there were always two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need two brothers to handle the money and manage the accounts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps one brother will handle decision making in particular, and one brother will mainly take care of the bookkeeping.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Need for the Ledger to Be Public</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Question: Some churches publicly display the ledger, while other places do not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What should the principle be?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Answer: I think that the income of a local church should be displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matters related to the work should be known to the co-working brothers and sisters of the region.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First the Expenses, Then the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Question: Because many people do not know how to give an offering, should the offering boxes be separately designated for the locality and for the work?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Answer: It does not matter if the brothers and sisters do not designate them; we have to do the designating.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The expenses of a local church, such as electricity, water, and rent, should always come first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The needy brothers come second.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The workers should always be placed third and not first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are first, then something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we need to care for the needy brothers first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church in Jerusalem gave first to the brothers in need, not to the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, workers should not be mistaken to think that the apostles are first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, the poor, the needy brothers, the widows, and the orphans are first.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to help these people first, then come to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should never first care for the apostles, then care for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That would be completely backwards.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The case in Jerusalem is quite clear: The offerings were distributed among all according as anyone had need.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After this come the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not want to be the first.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is also done according to the spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we send money out, then money will be sent to us from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should retain a small amount, whether one-third, one-fifth, or one-tenth, the less the better.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The rest should always be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way there will be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we do have the money, divide it according to the need.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do it according to the proportions we have written down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we personally have a particular need, then we should go before God separately and look to Him for the need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Co-workers can receive only according to their proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I think this closely follows the biblical principle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The matter of money is a very difficult matter, but I think that handling it this way is very much according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Based on what I can see in Acts and the Epistles in the New Testament, there is only this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The method used to divide money was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was no difficulty at all; it was divided in a very good way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a matter of need, not gift.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A church might say that since a certain brother is able to preach, they would give him more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I cannot give more to Timothy because he preaches better than Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word need is very good; with it we cannot easily go wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Way to Distribute Money</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Entrusted to You</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: If someone entrusts me with the distribution of an amount of money, how should I determine the proportions?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Answer: Before a list of proportions is produced, according to my personal view, I myself would not use anything that has been entrusted to me for distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As soon as I use any, there will be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as you use it, spontaneously you will appear to be unfaithful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No matter how clear your conscience is, you still will not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A difficulty with the conscience is different from other difficulties; you cannot reason with it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is like a child that cries when he wants to cry and throws a tantrum when he wants to throw a tantrum.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there is a sum of money for me to distribute, even if I use one dollar, my conscience will have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If it was designated for me, then I can use it as I please.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If it is one thousand dollars, it would not matter if I used nine hundred ninety-nine for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if I was asked to administrate and distribute it, I would still give out the whole amount.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that once we establish the proportions, we cannot go wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the past we did not have established proportions; we needed to give away the whole amount.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In your region every co-worker has a portion due him, and you also have a portion due you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In such a case we should distribute according to the proportions, and no difficulties with the conscience will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the past we indeed gave out the entire amount.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes a brother or sister sent in money, and when there was no way to distribute it, I wrote a letter telling them that I did not know how to distribute it and asked them what I should do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One sister replied with a good answer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She said, If you want to throw it into the Whampoa River, that is your business.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You can do as you see fit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because she washed her hands of the affair, it became an entirely different matter.</S>
