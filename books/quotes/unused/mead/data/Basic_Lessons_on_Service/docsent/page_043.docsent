   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>a. One Cake as a Heave Offering unto the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the children of Israel offered a peace offering according to God's requirements, they did not need to offer any cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God required only the cattle for the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if the offerer was thankful to God and offered it for a thanksgiving, he had to add something to the required peace offering.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every time the serving priest offered a peace offering for thanksgiving, he had to take out one cake for a heave offering.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then this piece would become his portion.</S>
