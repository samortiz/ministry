<h2 class="head2">Returned from Hunan, Hupeh, and<br />Kiangsi Provinces (Chekiang)</h2><p>Our meetings began in 1935. During the Sino-Japanese War, most of the brothers and sisters left for Hunan, Hupeh, Kweichow, Kwangsi, and Kiangsi provinces. They worked and preached the gospel at the same time. After the war, we began to return from Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi, and other places to our original localities.</p><p>In August 1948, we began praying and preaching the gospel in different brothers' homes every Lord's Day. By the Lord's arrangement, we built a three-room tiled house in the winter of 1948 and began regular meetings. We established the Lord's table and had a baptism meeting on February 5 of this year. There were thirty-one people breaking bread to remember the Lord. Every Lord's Day we preach the gospel, edify the believers, fellowship, and break bread in four different meetings. There is a sisters' meeting and a prayer meeting on Thursday and Saturday.</p><p>Our reason for writing this letter is to have the fellowship in life with the churches in other localities and to ask the brothers and sisters to remember to pray for this young and weak church.</p><p>Yu Yien-chuan, Shao Bao-xin, Chen De-hui<br />May 21, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: c/o Gao Chiao Post Office Box, Fu Yang, Chekiang</p><h2 class="head2">News from Hankow (Hupeh)</h2><p>After I returned to Hankow, I consulted with Brother Liu Ai-wu by letter and made preparations to safely return the children who could be returned to their own homes in Hankow. He answered that there was no one who would be coming soon, and they could not send someone just for this purpose. Therefore, I can only wait. Life in the orphanage goes on as usual. There is enough food to last for the summer. Once there is someone to supervise the children, we will begin bringing groups of them to Hankow.</p><p>Brother Zhu Si-jin of southern Shantung province had tuberculosis for a long time and passed away on the sixth of this month! His widow and orphaned children are all at Chili. Fortunately, their uncle has a stationery store in Chili where he also does some farming. The brothers in Chili are all very poor. A certain brother and his family do not have the strength to hoe and have no way to make a living. What can we do?</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />June 26, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 59 Xiao Dung Jia Alley 1, Hankow</p><p>(The Hebron Orphanage is in the remote locality of Chili, Hunan. There is a limit to what can be produced, and they cannot expand, so it must close its operations. According to the latest news, the children have already begun coming in groups to Hankow. Brother Lan Tsi-yi has already moved to Hankow for the gospel work.&mdash;Editor)</p>
