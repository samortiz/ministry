   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If you study biology, you will find out that the eyes are like a pair of glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They need to be cleaned and washed often, or else they will not be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every time the eyelids are closed, tears flow out to wash the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Similarly, in the spiritual world, the spiritual eyes of those who do not shed tears must not have been washed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, they cannot see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is no wonder that those who have never been wounded, afflicted, or have never encountered anything that was heart-breaking, distressful, or depressing to their spirit are ignorant and unclear about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once the parents of a child were quite good and quite zealous for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They did a great deal of good work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But after a short time, the child whom they dearly loved died.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They became very angry and said, "From now on we will not serve God any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we have served Him faithfully, He not only did not favor us with His grace, but He allowed our child to die."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were quite upset.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From then on they became indifferent; they were no longer zealous and no longer pursued the Lord in a serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day after eight or nine years, the father was walking in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He saw a shepherd trying to lead a flock of sheep across a little creek.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the country side there are usually no sturdy bridges over the little creeks.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this case, a little wooden plank over the creek served as a bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was adequate for people to walk across but very difficult to convince the sheep to walk across.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sheep are very timid and unsophisticated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter how much the shepherd goaded and coerced them, they would not cross it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Finally, out of desperation, the shepherd picked up a little lamb who was not weaned and precious to the mother sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He carried him across to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The mother sheep, out of love for her little lamb, took the risk and followed the shepherd across.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Soon after, all the lamb's brothers and sisters followed and crossed to the other side of the creek.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The father, who was observing this, said, "It is enough!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From then on, he was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later he testified, "Because God was afraid that I would be left on this side of the creek and would not go across, He took my child over first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the dumb sheep knew to follow the others across.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why then am I still tarrying here?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times tears bring men closer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a person has only passed through smooth and peaceful pathways and has never suffered the deprivation of wind, sleet, frost, and blizzard, he can never advance to become a deeper person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he is willing to be a Christian only in peaceful times and unwilling to be one in days of tears, he is merely a mediocre person with little experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today many people will not believe because they have never suffered pain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, if someone in the world fills his days with laughter, eating, and drinking, he can do just fine if no extraordinary events occur.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, anyone who cannot shed tears will not be able to see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No wonder they are still in their stupor, drunken with the worldly wine, and have not yet received salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christians have also hardened their hearts and are unwilling to wipe their eyes with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No wonder they are so dull in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us study the Bible and see what it says about tears and how we should deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not need to rejoice or laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we need to mourn and weep because today is the time for weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This world is a place for weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me say again that people who put their tears aside are unenlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They do not know their place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Oh, whoever cannot shed tears has lost their characteristic as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Indeed, the shedding of tears is the real meaning to human life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us see what the Lord would like us to be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the entire Bible, there are only a few dozen references to tears.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we do not need to read all of these verses; it is sufficient just to read several of them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we are about to speak today can be summarized in several points: the meaning of tears, the relationship between tears and the repentance of sinners, and the relationship between tears and the prayer and work of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the end we will see what God does with our tears.</S>
