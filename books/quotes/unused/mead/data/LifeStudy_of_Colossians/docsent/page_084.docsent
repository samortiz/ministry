   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Where There Cannot Be Any Natural Persons</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 11 Paul goes on to say, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word where, referring to the new man in verse 10, means in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no natural person in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There cannot be Greeks, who are for philosophical wisdom, and Jews, who are for miraculous signs 1 Cor 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There cannot be circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Circumcision refers to the observers of the Jewish religious rituals; uncircumcision refers to those who do not care for the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, in the new man there cannot be barbarian, Scythian, slave, or freeman.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A barbarian is an uncultured person, the Scythians were considered the most barbarous people, the slaves were those sold into slavery, and the freemen were those who had been freed from slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the new man is concerned, we must regard ourselves as nobodies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the new man there is room only for Christ, not for any kind of natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in the church we all are nobodies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Christ Being All and in All</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the new man there is room only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is all the members of the new man and in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is everything in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, He is the new man, His Body 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the new man Christ is the centrality and universality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word all in verse 11 refers to all the members who make up the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is all these members, and He is in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, in the church there is no room for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no room for any nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As those who are part of the new man, we should not regard ourselves as Chinese, Americans, Germans, or any other nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not even say that you are so-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since Christ is all and in all in the new man and you are part of the new man, then you are part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Each member, each part, of the new man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In saying that there cannot be any natural person in the new man, verse 11 is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What a great mistake it is to translate the Greek here as the new self!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is foolish to say that in the new self there is no Greek and Jew, no circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the context, the new man in 3:10 certainly does not denote the new self, for the new man is made up of believers from many different cultural backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not true of the so-called new self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No doubt, the new man here is a corporate man, the church, Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although many different kinds of people make up the church, all are part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are no longer the natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is everyone in the new man, and He is in everyone in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a tremendous vision it is to see that Christ is all and in all!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is crucial for us to see two things: that we need to be renewed unto full knowledge according to the all-inclusive Christ, who is the image of God; and that in the church as the new man Christ is everyone and in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church, the new man, there is nothing but Christ.</S>
