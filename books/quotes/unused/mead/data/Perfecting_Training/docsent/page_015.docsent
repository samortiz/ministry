   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A DEEPER PROBLEM PECULIARITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Very good!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now I feel that we have to go on a little deeper and a little further to touch a subtle thing that is within nearly all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not believe that any among us could guess what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Colossians Training we saw that the subtle thing that frustrates us from experiencing Christ is our culture, but you have to realize that culture is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the Colossians Training we have dealt mainly with two things: culture and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two things frustrate us from experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our opinion is more subjective to us than our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we have to consider another thing which is even more subjective than our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is this hidden thing that is a great frustration to our experiencing Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Hymns, #840, there is a phrase which says, from peculiar traits deliver.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This hidden matter within us which frustrates us so greatly is our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is peculiarity?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is our biased and warped characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not mean crooked or perverted but biased and warped.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Testament tells us that we have to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While these two verses are in the Bible, we don t realize how much these three things culture, opinion, and peculiarity frustrate us from actually living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have never read a book telling us that culture, opinion, and peculiarity are great frustrations to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But today we must see this very matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is your peculiarity?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother, please tell us what is your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do think about this a lot, and this song touches me more than any other song in the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And the line concerning the peculiar traits I can never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I well realize that I m a peculiar person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I know also that I appear that way to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Recently I was considering another brother who is very different from myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I considered how normal this brother is, how mild he is in his temperament, and I was considering that I simply wasn t born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Knowing that I have certain peculiarities has given me a kind of longing over the years to be free from the peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I realize that the way I do things is peculiar and the way I think is peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even everything I do is peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything I am is peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I m longing to get some help on this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have to realize that we all are peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all are biased and warped.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These kinds of things could never be touched by the regular teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may hear message after message but none would touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need another brother to tell us what his peculiarities are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother, what are your peculiarities?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do I have peculiarities?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me help a little.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You see that all the saints have laughed at your question.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that no doubt through the years in all the meetings you have impressed them with something.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do believe that what is within their understanding must be this thing peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Would you please tell us what is your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then I would ask the others who have laughed at you to tell us what is your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Don t think, however, that only this brother has some peculiarity and you don t.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is simply that his peculiarity has been all the time coming out, and yours has been all the time concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please go on to tell us, brother, what your peculiarity is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have been very concerned with this one point over the years, and I don t know if others have had the same kind of thought or not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For a long time I have considered this matter of peculiarity and that others must think that I am peculiar because of the typical response that the saints give me in meetings and in just about any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In my consideration I have felt that what comes out of me is not the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It s just me by birth and this bothers me a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have realized that we should live Christ, yet I m living by my peculiarities day after day and this really bothers me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have been condemned, concerned, and worried about this for years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe at least in part it has to do with the matter of joking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Deep-seated in my being is a kind of characteristic to slant something toward the humorous side.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, if I felt like being humorous I would, but if not I would turn it off like a faucet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times when I shut this off I sensed Christ and not myself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when I turned it on I sensed myself and not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This has bothered me for years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps at least part of my problem is just the tendency to slant something toward a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But it may be that is rather superficial and there is some root which produces this kind of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yes, this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I first met you in the Bay Area more than eleven years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So for many years we have known each other.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am especially used to paying much attention to the young seeking saints including yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have noticed that you surely love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You have been much graced by the Lord and you do have a heart to go on with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But there is a big factor, a negative factor, within you that has been frustrating you all the time from the richer experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>And this factor is your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You don t love the world, and you aren t so much in yourself or in your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the growth in life and the function in the Body has not come up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have realized that sometimes you are struggling to grow, to gain more of Christ, to experience more of Christ, and to be more useful in the functioning in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet something is there frustrating, and that something is peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You have realized some aspects of your peculiarity, but now we need some others who know you quite well to help you realize something more concerning your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I don t really know whether I can tell you exactly what our brother s peculiarity is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have noticed over the years that there is a kind of peculiarity, but I would say it s not just a matter of lightness or of having a kind of joking personality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It comes out that way, but actually something is there that I cannot explain.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is simply there.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It sticks out, and when you think of this brother, that is what you think of.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I don t have a definition for it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need someone else to help us, perhaps someone who knows the brother better.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Please be bold to tell us something, to tell us your impression about this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our brother seems to be a humorous person, but actually I believe he s a very detailed person.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>From knowing him in the past, I know he likes to do things in a very fine and detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Because he is such a fine and detailed person, I believe a lot of things bother him.</S>
