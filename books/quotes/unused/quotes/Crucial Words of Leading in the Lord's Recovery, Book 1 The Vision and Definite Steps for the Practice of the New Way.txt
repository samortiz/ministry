We do not want to have some religious activities or busy outward works while missing Your inner presence and not touching You
Lord, in such a training, keep us so that we would remain in fellowship with You and that we would touch Your heart's desire and Yourself
We want to be taught and encouraged but more than that we want to know Your way and be preserved by You gained by You and sustained by You
May You grow within us, daily softening us, so that we would be truly mingled with You and be in one fellowship with You
May there be genuine growth within us, and may there be a broad pathway within us that will open all the doors in us
Save us, and remove all filthiness so that our mind, heart, and spirit, including our conscience, would be clear
Whatever we would cover, may all of us touch the same thing, and may all of us get into it and pursue after it in spirit
Even when a person understands a term, it is very important to know if he understands it correctly and accurately
In Acts 26:19, while he was defending himself before King Agrippa, he uttered this word: 'I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision'
In order to understand the meaning of the word vision, we must understand the context of Paul's speaking in verses 4 through 23
Prior to verse 19, Paul said that he was once a zealous Judaizer, being zealous for the religion and traditions of his forefathers
At the same time, he joined one of the strictest sects of Judaism and became a Pharisee, sitting under the most famous teacher, Gamaliel
While he was yet a young man, he received authority from the chief priests in the Jewish religion to put many believers into prison
He even requested a letter from the chief priests and took the lead to put into bondage all those who called on the name of the Lord
While he was on the way to Damascus, the Lord met him and said to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
Concerning the word vision, our emphasis is not on its Old Testament meaning but on what Paul said in Acts 26:19
Later, while he was back in England on furlough, he went to the seashore one day to spend some time alone with the Lord
He felt that the Lord was calling him to consecrate himself entirely to those people and to send the gospel to the interior of China
In the following forty to fifty years, hundreds and thousands of people were sent to the interior parts of China to preach the gospel
The Old Testament begins with God's creation, or the creation of Adam, and spans four thousand years until the birth of the Lord Jesus
In Noah is seen one who walked with God and worked with God to build the ark to meet the need of that generation
In Abraham is seen God's calling, God's promise, justification by faith, the living by faith, and the living in fellowship with God
The Life-study trainings emphasize life; they do not pay that much attention to history, genealogies, and dates
In Acts 13:20 Paul says, 'After these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet'
Since this period of time has much to do with the vision given at that time, we must study the matter in depth
We can say that during that period of time there was no properly appointed king from God to unite the whole nation of Israel
Although Saul was appointed by God to be king, in God's eyes his words did not count; only Samuel's words counted
As for David, he was anointed early on, but at the beginning it was neither his words nor Saul's words that counted, but Samuel's words
Based on the above, we can make a clear conclusion: The age of the judges was terminated only after David became king over all of Israel
According to 1 Kings 6:1, from the time of the exodus to the fourth year of Solomon were four hundred eighty years
Although both Saul and David were kings, the only one who served according to a vision was Samuel, who served as a judge
Can we believe that at that time there were actually only eight people serving God, and the rest were worshipping idols and not serving God?
Some people might ask whether at the time Noah was busily building the ark there was not a single person on earth who feared God
In the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, the prodigal said to his father when he returned home, 'I have sinned against heaven'
When Jesus of Nazareth came, He also served God, and a group of Galilean fishermen followed Him as His disciples
The Levites were divided into twenty-four orders and were offering sacrifices and ministering according to their orders
In the eyes of man, such services were certainly proper and dignified, but were they carried out under a vision?
We are all very clear that the services of the priests in the temple were not carried out under a vision; they were carried out by tradition
It was the Lord Jesus and those who were following Him who were serving under a vision and whose service was pleasing to God
Perhaps in the eyes of men this is blind following, yet this kind of following pleases God, and this kind of following is done with a vision
They did not receive any vision individually, but the One whom they were following had the vision, and that was enough
Some brothers and sisters on occasion have been asked by others You say that the pastors are wrong the pope is wrong and everyone is wrong
In Acts 5, while Peter was ministering, the Jewish synagogue rose up to oppose the apostles and put them into prison
The only ones who had the vision were the apostles who were imprisoned and the simple ones who were following them
We need to see that not only was Peter's service under a vision, but even the simple ones who followed him were serving under a vision
From that time onward, the Bible reverses the order of the two men; it begins to refer to them as 'Paul and Barnabas'
At the beginning of Acts 18, we are told that through his tentmaking Paul gained a couple, Aquila and Priscilla
Another group of people thought that they were superior; they did not consider themselves as belonging to anyone
Paul wanted to go to Corinth, and he wanted Apollos to go with him to solve the problem of division in the church in Corinth
It is difficult to say that the one who plants is under the vision, but the one who waters is not under the vision
Today in Christianity, many Christians claim that they are spiritual, but they do not like to listen to others
Sometimes we have a feeling concerning a certain matter, but we can only say to the brothers, 'I urge you to do this
If we study the book of Acts and the Epistles of Paul, we can see that many times Paul pointedly told people to do certain things
We see clearly from the revelation of the New Testament that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was acting under the vision
When Paul was raised up in his ministry, he received a vision that touched the heavens, the earth, and Paradise
Under the vision, however, Abel offered a sacrifice that was acceptable to God, but Cain offered his sacrifice apart from the vision
Noah's family of eight people, by serving according to Noah's pattern, became servants who served according to a vision
During those one hundred twenty years Noah was on the one hand preaching the word of righteousness and on the other hand building the ark
He acknowledged that Paul's word was as precious as the Old Testament Scriptures and that believers should take heed to it
Based on this, the names of all those who did not join themselves to Paul's vision were eventually dropped from the record of the Bible
We can ask ourselves the same question: Are we those who are serving according to the vision, and if so, what is our vision?
Some join our meetings because they think that the brothers and sisters here are very zealous loving the Lord and that the messages are good
When they hear that we go to church meetings, they also change their terminology and talk about attending 'church meetings'
The divine revelation upon which He based His speaking is veritable; it is written in black and white and is not abstract at all
On the Sabbath day, when He took His disciples across the grainfields, the disciples picked ears of grain and ate
The first message that Peter delivered on the day of Pentecost was a defense based extensively on the Scriptures
He quoted the prophet Joel and proclaimed that Jesus of Nazareth, whom the people had crucified on the cross, had been raised up by God
With the truth of the Bible as our guiding principle, we can study and examine all the denominations and sects that we find today
It considers all British citizens members of the Anglican Church by birth, whether or not they are believers and have been baptized
We cannot say that as long as people have the Bible, they have the revelation or are acting according to the vision
It is very possible that they merely hold the Bible in their hands; they have not realized the vision and revelation contained in the Bible
The standard of such revelation must be sufficiently high; it must be up to the standard of the divine revelation
The way to build this ark is to preach the gospel, set up home meetings, teach the truth, and have everyone prophesy
Perhaps you expound the Bible, and perhaps you serve very zealously, but your service is not 'building the ark'
We have the same Bible in our hands, but some people have no light even after they have read it a hundred times
In the Lord's recovery, every page, every verse, every sentence, and even every word shine with revelation and light
In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said that Apollos watered, but in the same verse he told the Corinthians that he was the one who planted
The Catholic Church builds up its own church, and the charismatics build up their own tongue-speaking churches
No one is building according to the blueprint that Paul received; no one is building according to the revelation of the Bible
The Lord issues the blueprint, the revelation, and the utterance, and through one man He supervises and completes the building work
In the first chapter, entitled 'Vision in God's Economy,' we read how God's servants and the Lord's followers must see a vision
We have to believe that Adam and Eve not only lived by the vision, but they also told their children about this vision
Abel belonged to the first kind; he lived under his father's vision, and his father's vision became his vision
For man to call on the name of Jehovah means to receive the Triune God into him to be his enjoyment and supply
He inherited Adam's vision, Abel's vision, and Enosh's vision, but he went on to see that he could not be separated from God
We have to believe that Noah at his time inherited Adam's vision, Abel's vision, Enosh's vision, and Enoch's vision
He saw the tabernacle and the ordinances regarding the offerings and other matters, which we cannot describe here in detail
Not only did they prophesy and speak for God; they saw vision after vision in a definite way and served according to these visions
They turned the kings back from the things contrary to the visions to a service that was once again under the visions
He did not wear a priestly garment but instead lived in the wilderness, eating locusts and wild honey and wearing camel's hair
The baptism of John the Baptist initiated the Lord Jesus into His office for the accomplishment of His ministry
John the Baptist clearly indicated that his ministry was a pioneering and initiating ministry , but his disciples did not understand this
Not only were the Jewish religionists not under the vision; even the followers of John the Baptist were not under the vision
On the other hand, He encouraged John to take the way that the Lord had ordained for him and to experience the blessing in that way
They even forsook their fishing career, leaving behind their fathers and their nets, and followed the Lord single-heartedly
At that time all those who were following the Lord Jesus, male or female, including such ones as Mary, were all foolish
When we come to Acts 10, however, we find that his strong Jewish background stood in the way and caused the vision to suffer a setback
On the day of Pentecost, Peter used one key to open the door for the Jews to enter God's New Testament kingdom
In Acts 7 through 9 he was Saul of Tarsus, a person who was in the Jewish religion and had received the highest education
He also put many believers into prison, cast votes to condemn them to death, and persecuted them even as far as foreign cities
Saul, however, was not under the vision, yet one day on his way to Damascus the Lord met him and showed him the vision
We do not see anything about the believers being built up into the Body of Christ to be one with the Triune God as His organism
All the members together with Paul were constituted to become His Body and were joined to Him to become an enlarged 'Me'
Although the vision Paul saw at the beginning was so high and profound, he did not take up his ministry immediately
If we carefully study the book of Acts and Paul's Epistles, we will discover that this matter is not that simple or shallow
Although he was the one who ushered Paul into the service, when Paul saw the up-to-date vision of the age, Barnabas was left behind
Paul worked throughout the Gentile world, but he never stayed in one place for as long as three years except in Ephesus
The reason that the church in Ephesus degraded was that it had taken the lead to depart from the teaching of the apostles
With the departure of the apostles' teaching came the teaching of Balaam , the teaching of the Nicolaitans , and the teaching of Jezebel
If anyone tries to cut off anything, he will be cut off from the blessing of the tree of life, the water of life, and the city of life
In order to serve God according to the up-to-date vision, we need to come up to the level of Paul's very last Epistles
In the National Palace Museum in Taipei, there is a painting on a long scroll called 'The River Scene at Ching-Ming Festival'
One has to go all the way from one end to the other end before he can have a clear picture or vision of the entire spectrum of life in China
It begins from Adam's vision of the tree of life in the garden of Eden and extends all the way to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life
Can we say that five hundred years ago Martin Luther saw this vision and was serving according to this vision?
The Jews are pious people; they are zealous in expounding the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, but they have only the Old Testament
The goal of all our services, including preaching the gospel and edifying the believers, must be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem
The vision has never changed, but the persons have indeed changed, and those who follow the vision also have changed
In order for them to write a book to refute me, they must first read my books, but once they read my books, they are convinced and subdued
Between 1942 and 1948 there was a great storm, and Brother Nee was forced to discontinue his ministry for six years
Paul told Timothy, 'All who are in Asia turned away from me' , but Paul did not authorize Timothy to have another beginning
In the same way, at the time when almost everyone in China forsook Brother Nee, he did not try to make another beginning
You are following a vision a vision that matches the age a vision that inherits all that was in the past and a vision that is allinclusive
If you remain in the book of Acts, you may have inherited everything prior to that time, but you are not up to date
Although everyone says that he loves the Lord, there is no clear vision, and men are 'carried about by every wind'
My point is this: Although James was pious to the uttermost in Jerusalem, we cannot conclude from this that his pathway was the right one
We certainly need to exercise ourselves unto godliness; we should not be loose, and our personality and character, should be noble
Not only should the churches in Taiwan do this, but all the churches in all the continents throughout the earth should do this
Timothy 3:15-16 says, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
What the church supports and upholds is the teaching according to godliness which is God manifesting Himself in the flesh through the church
If anyone teaches anything apart from the New Testament teaching, he is teaching differently, and he does not consent to healthy words
According to the record of Genesis 17, God established circumcision with Abraham as a sign of an eternally immutable covenant
The Jewish Christians argued that even in the New Testament age, God's people, that is, His children, were not exempt from circumcision
Healthy words are those that are not only scriptural, but those that consent to the revelation of the Lord Jesus
These words according to the mystery of godliness are the consistent and overall revelation of God in the New Testament
He reminded them how for three years he was in their midst, not shrinking from declaring to them all the counsel of God
In John 10 the Lord said that He is the good Shepherd and that He came to lay down His life that men may receive life
Outwardly, those who teach differently are God's people, but the different teaching that they are teaching is the unhealthy teaching
If we eat unhealthy food, not only will it not benefit us, but it will actually harm our body and threaten our physical life
Under the strong influence of Judaism, they mixed God's New Testament economy with the out-of-date Old Testament economy
He even told Paul, 'They have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses
James was saying that there were tens of thousands of believers in Jerusalem who could not accept what Paul had done
Since that is the case, why would Paul concede to James's proposal when he was in Jerusalem and go back to the law?
Although Paul tried to become as a Jew to the Jews and as a Gentile to the Gentiles, the Lord did not allow him to compromise
It not only saved his life from the persecuting hands of the Jews but it saved him from the peril of tearing down Gods New Testament economy
It was not absolute for God's New Testament economy, and it contained a strong mixture of Old Testament elements
Because his burden was so heavy, he was not able to forget about Jerusalem even during the third journey of his ministry
In the end, Paul was kept in custody under the hands of the Romans and was isolated from the disturbance and riot
He passed through Macedonia and wrote the first Epistle to Timothy, telling Timothy that some in Ephesus had a problem
A little more than a year after Paul was released from prison, Nero, the Roman Caesar, began to persecute the Christians
In 2 Timothy 113 Paul said Hold a pattern of the healthy words that you have heard from me in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus
We need to deposit the Lords healthy words including the riches of life in the Lords words into our being like we deposit money in the bank
When we come to Revelation 2 and 3 we find the Lord writing to the seven churches in Asia and the first letter was to the church in Ephesus
While he was alive, he was the only one on the whole earth who could echo what we saw concerning spiritual life principles
From 1937 to 1938 Brother Watchman Nee visited a number of countries in Europe and stayed there for more than a year and a half
At that time he called together a special fellowship meeting and reported to us in detail his fellowship with Brother AustinSparks in London
After his visit, he wrote three letters, one to Manila, one to Hong Kong, and one to Taipei, highly promoting Brother Austin-Sparks
He said that Brother Austin-Sparks was a spiritual giant and that he had a strong burden to come to the Far East to witness for the Lord
It is not very easy for a person to expose his flaws in the big things; the problems are always with the small things
In the January 1955 issue there was a column acknowledging the Christmas cards that he had received from readers
After visiting for about a month, one morning we asked him to have a time of fellowship with the hundred or more co-workers that we had
He took the initiative to ask that question in order to provide Brother Austin-Sparks the opportunity to speak what he had prepared
We need to realize that if one's vision is not clear, he can be very spiritual, but he can become quite confused in certain matters
After the meetings they would put on their caps and fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the meeting hall
Brother Austin-Sparks came to our meetings and started questioning such practices among us as the breaking of bread
These were traces that gave us a hint that his way and our way could not be reconciled because what we saw was different
Suddenly a brother asked, 'Brother Austin-Sparks, suppose here in Taipei there are five assemblies that meet in the Lord's name
We cannot say that simply because her spiritual stature was high that she was right in the matter of the church'
Whether or not a person has a justifiable position is based not so much on his condition as on the ground he takes
On one hand, no matter how spiritual a person was, if he remained in Babylon and stood on the ground of captivity, he was wrong
At any rate, we cannot despise the returned captives' ground simply because their spiritual condition was poor
Although he was a man in the New Testament, he had one foot in the New Testament and the other foot in the Old Testament
History tells us that he was so pious that the skin of his knees grew coarser than an elephant's skin from kneeling
We can detect through various hints that the cause of Ephesus's decline was its failure to rid itself of Apollos's seed
From the time of Paul's first imprisonment to the time he was imprisoned again was a period of about three years
During that period he charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to take care of the church because there was a problem there
During Pauls second imprisonment he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy to tell him that all the churches in Asia had forsaken his ministry
The cause for the churches' decline was the forsaking of the apostles' teaching; they forsook the apostles' ministry
After he finished writing concerning the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, God's visions were complete
At the end of Revelation, which is the end of the entire Bible, there is the warning against any further addition or deletion
During the first sixteen hundred years of church history, countless numbers of lovers of the Lord were raised up
Spontaneously they became different from the first group, and they discovered that they could not fellowship with the first group
Throughout the last sixteen centuries, many lovers of the Lord were raised up, yet they were not able to be in one accord
The reason is not that there was sin or evil among them, but that the vision each held was different in degree
A young brother once said, 'Brother Nee used to speak of the cross, but we do not speak concerning it anymore'
By reading the messages on the New Jerusalem, we can see that in order to become the gates of pearl we must pass through the Lord's death
Every one of the nineteen items in the book The Experience of Life involves dealings that are related to the cross
We need to speak regarding the dealing of the cross, but we should not make this truth our limitation or our issue
We do not oppose tongue-speaking, but if someone emphasizes tongue-speaking to the point of strongly promoting it, it becomes a great damage
One may do this out of harmless zeal, but if his listeners receive his speaking and enlarge upon it, it will bring a problem into the church
In practice, the Body is expressed as the local churches in various localities, practicing the Body life in a practical and proper way
Dispositional sanctification is transformation, and transformation includes the dealing and breaking of the cross
In the history of the development of Christian doctrine, this entire set of truths finds its full recovery only among us
In the end he not only destroyed himself, but he destroyed the work of God and brought trouble to all the saints in the land of Judea
The fact that Jerusalem was burned to the ground and that thousands of people were killed was altogether James's fault
Regrettably, today on the earth, when believers see a little revelation in the New Testament, they begin to think quite highly of themselves
We have the same Bible, the same God, and the same Savior, and we have received the same Spirit and the same salvation
We all believe in the blood of the Lord, and we all share the same faith, but any further advance beyond this basis ends in differences
Although the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 had degraded and their condition was poor, the Lord still recognized them as churches
Many have seen the initial vision, and they are satisfied with what they have seen, but they should not stop there
In the process of becoming this, we experience regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification
As we have seen, the vision that matches the age is the vision that extends all the way from Genesis to Revelation
You are following this ultimate and completed vision, and you are spreading the gospel according to the Lord's commandment
Those who are sitting here today are either co-workers, elders, or full-timers who are learning to serve the Lord
In the parable of Matthew 20, the householder went out and said to the idle workmen, 'Why have you been standing here all the day idle'?
Today when we speak concerning the one accord, we are not speaking concerning a certain method that we must practice
If we have different emphases and different ways of doing things, our energy will be dissipated, and our faith will be weakened
Needless to say, in mainland China, with its vast differences between the north and the south, it was difficult to practice the one accord
In Acts after the Lord resurrected and ascended, He left the disciples on earth to continue His ministry and to carry out His commission
The reason Paul said this was that some in the church in Corinth said that they were of Paul, because Paul had brought them to the Lord
Unless these four groups of people saw the same vision, it would be impossible for them to speak the same thing
Ephesians 1 says that God's eternal economy in the fullness of the times is to head up not merely the believers but all things
The cow and the bear will graze; / Their young will lie down together; / And the lion will eat straw like the ox
The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, / And upon the viper's den / The weaned child will stretch his hand
No matter what nationality and race we belong to, and no matter what language we speak, we can speak the same thing
Based on these 'visions,' they devised a set of tenets of faith, and based on these tenets, a denomination was founded
The result is that many grounds are claimed by many different kinds of Christians, and the end is a multitude of divisions
In looking back over the history of the Lords recovery during the past sixty years we can see some who came but later were troubled and left
In practice, however, do we all agree that we need to spread the gospel, meet in the homes, build up the small groups, and teach the truth?
As long as we are men, and as long as we have a family, live in a society, and have a nation, we need to beget, nourish, and teach
Countless numbers of people appeared and disappeared from the political scene, but the real revolution was still not realized
Some students already had adopted Western-style clothing, but we were still wearing the Chinese long blue gown and cloth shoes
We were even afraid to speak in proper Mandarin, preferring instead to use the local dialect and native colloquialisms
A large meeting with fourteen thousand attendants surely draws much admiration, but the wonderful feeling does not last long
One brother testified that when his small group meeting began, no one showed up; as a result, he decided to go out and visit some people
At the beginning the scene may be discouraging, but those who endure to the end will be saved and will prevail
Countless numbers of people come forward to commit their names, but in the end, it is difficult to tell where they have gone
Once the small groups become uniform, the requirements increase, and it becomes difficult to bring in the new ones
We are here to pay attention not only to the number in the big church meetings but to the number attending the small group meetings
We can speak concerning the burden of the small group meetings in any meeting except the Lord's Day morning meeting
As long as there are people sitting in the big meetings on the Lord's Day morning, we must take care of their needs
The elders must work and labor diligently on the ones who come only to the big Lords Day morning meeting and not to the small group meetings
We need to work on the small groups in this way, and we need to work on the truth lesson meetings in the same way
After we have studied it, we can bring the result of our study back to our church to practice it in an absolute way
The co-workers do not need to busy themselves with the work there, but their help in sustaining a good preaching is needed
Even if there are only a few dozen people who come to listen to a message, we must still deliver a proper message
At the same time, our truth classes need to be absolutely proper according to the standard of the truth classes
Do not forget our slogan: 'Heaven and earth may pass away, but the small group meetings and the truth lessons must never be forsaken'
We have pointed out in the past that we need a life message after the bread-breaking meeting or the prayer meeting
One advantage to reading the messages is that in the sharing time the saints will not ramble in their speaking
Everyone holds back his function and refuses to share the portion that perfects the saints and benefits the church
If there is no control, the meeting will flow 'where the wind blows'; it will not move according to the leading of the Holy Spirit
In all the places that are practicing the truth classes, some are doing it rightly, but others are doing it wrongly
The main points, the lines of thought, and the material presented are very rich; they are more than what an ordinary believer can absorb
Since we are saved and by the Lord's mercy we are in His recovery, we should receive some basic education in the truth
All we need to do is study and memorize them and then teach the saints to repeatread emphasizeread prayread and vitalizeread them
If he merely listens to lectures day by day, he will not graduate from school, and he will not learn anything solid
The teaching of the truth lessons may appear dull, but in four years it will lay a firm foundation in the truth
We may have a 'doctor' among us, but we must remember that we are teaching the truth; we are not training people to become 'doctors'
At the same time, you need to encourage the saints to attend the small group meetings, and you need to make everyone speak
Those who always speak should be advised in private to speak less and to give more opportunity for others to speak
They may be full of words, but in order for others to be perfected, they should be advised to exercise some restraint
Encourage those who speak little or who do not speak at all to speak more, and the small group meetings will become living
If that is built up, we will have something to show the saints and to fellowship about when they come to visit us
Answer: In reality, your preparation does not have that much to do with the material; it has to do with your spirit
You need to find out the crucial points and practice repeat-reading, emphasize-reading, pray-reading, and vitalize-reading
If you prepare too much, you will have too much deposit within you, and it will be difficult for you not to preach
Lord, we ask You to visit us and bring us into Your heart's desire that we may have thorough fellowship in You
Lord open Yourself to us open the heavens to us reveal Your word to us unveil Your economy to us and show us what You intend to do today
In the past we always thought that Christianity was the most powerful religion the most widespread persuasive and capable of gaining people
Christianity has a low rate of increase because it has become a religion that binds people, that kills the organic function of the believers
The Catholic Church has the largest membership in Christianity; almost one-fourth of the world's population today are Catholics
Among them, however, it is difficult to find one out of a thousand or even ten thousand who functions organically
We began our work in Taiwan thirty-seven years ago, but we still have not been able to gospelize the small island of Taiwan
We went to every street and alley in all the different districts, not only on the Lord's Day afternoons but also during the week
We went in large teams and in small teams, holding lanterns, beating drums, and marching on the streets to preach the gospel
Every Lord's Day afternoon we preached the gospel in the New Park where the amphitheatre could hold three thousand people
In the practice of our church life we would not reject any of them who would come to us but we would not take the initiative to contact them
We completely lost the 'family tradition' we had brought to Taiwan in the beginning and turned instead to take the custom of the nations
Even though the slope may not be steep, if we are off by a fraction of an inch we may end up missing the mark by a thousand miles
We were active for more than twenty years, going to meetings not only once a week but three or four times a week
In terms of action, however, only a few of us have discarded the old things and have made a turn to practice the new way
Surely Paul did not go to keep the Sabbath, but he utilized the custom practiced by the Jews who were scattered among the Gentiles
When the Jews were gathered in the synagogues to study the Scriptures on the Sabbath, Paul went to preach to them the New Testament gospel
Today nearly everywhere in the world people have a day off on the Lord's Day; they do not go to work, nor do they go to school
Among us there is also a group of saints who are used to this custom; for this reason, we must take care of them
As a result, the Lord's Day morning meeting looks like a big meeting, and it also looks like a class that teaches truth lessons
Since we have a Lord's Day morning meeting, even if only ten people come, we must be serious and speak a message to them
The management of the church by the co-workers is not a principle revealed in the Bible; it is a traditional practice in religion
The elders in a certain meeting hall may also feel that it is good for the co-workers to help in the administration of their meeting hall
Because we are still accustomed to the old religion, once we see the loose situation in the small groups, we become disheartened
Brothers, we owe not only the Lord and the brothers and sisters, we even have an obligation to our consecration
If we believe that one day we will stand before the judgment seat of the Lord, we should be very serious today
The co-workers and elders have a great responsibility for the improvement of the situation of the small groups
The way of religion is to have a Sunday service that is mainly a facade, but our way is to have all the saints functioning organically
If a family puts on a facade every day, it would no longer be a family but a restaurant, and all the members would be 'choked to death'
Do not be bothered by the 'dragging' situation in the small group; rather, welcome it, because it shows that we care for all the members
If we are not willing to labor on this matter, the small groups will eventually be 'dragged' into Hades and will become nothing
In this way, the 'dragging' of the small group will be the 'singing of the songs of ascents'; the more it is 'dragged,' the higher it goes
If every small group can bring in a new one each week, we will bring in 1,600 in a month, and almost 20,000 in a year
The new ones are not strangers invited off the street; rather, they are all related to the members of the small groups
Without a facade and without rituals, religion is knocked down and the functions of the members are manifested
Ask the saints to set a time and place to have small group meetings and to let their friends relatives and neighbors know about the meetings
Some may have something to do late at night but they should still be able to meet with the group and then go and take care of their business
We do not need to begin with singing hymns and reading the Bible, and then serve snacks after the meeting is over
Once we have a podium, there is the appearance of a law court, the putting on of a facade; this is religion, and it kills people
The only Christian group that lasted is called Congregacaon in Portuguese, equivalent to congregation in English
After more than fifty years in Brazil, at the time of my visit in 1965, it had more than three hundred thousand saints
In their big meetings they put two microphones out, one for the brothers and one for the sisters, for testimonies
All the one-talented ones will be buried because they dare not, cannot, and do not have the opportunity to function
He also knew that sending the saved ones to the denominations could be compared to putting them into a freezer; this way only leads to death
The elders in every meeting hall must take this matter of the small group seriously and endeavor to carry it out
These two or three should have fellowship once a week to see who is the appropriate one to release the message
We should make a copy of each card and distribute the copies to different small groups according to the addresses
They may need to invite a certain one for a meal once a month for six months before he is willing to come to a meeting
Even though the characteristic of the small group is 'dragging,' you should have a life message to supply people
If the saints are not fully fed, they should at least be half fed; do not let them go home with an empty stomach
Some may think that it has taken them awhile to reach this number and that once they divide, their group will be finished
After a group of twelve is subdivided into two groups of about five to six people, gradually, each group will increase to twelve
The purpose of Truth Lessons is to show the saints that there are certain truths in the Bible that we should know
The content of the examination is not what the teachers have explained but what is written in the teaching materials
In this way, even if a 'famous professor' has his own way of teaching, we still must teach based on the teaching material
In the past year and a half, the number of saints in the church has in fact increased, but the rate of increase is not that encouraging
At first we may think that every small group must have some so-called 'core members' to bear the responsibility
When we divide the group, making the number smaller, each group will be strong and propagating, even if it is weak temporarily
We need to know that in order to make the meeting hall or church where we are prosperous and fruitful, we must labor on the small groups
We have this saying among us, 'Heaven and earth may pass away, but the small group meetings must never be forsaken'
Lord, be in our midst and give us a deep impression so that we may clearly touch, and carry out as well, all that You want us to do
Lord, cleanse us and cover us with Your prevailing blood; draw the limit for us and do not allow Your enemy to overstep
Acts 2 says that immediately after the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they had meetings from house to house
When we speak of meeting in a group, it seems as if the group can be either large or small, depending on our preference
When we speak of meeting in a house, in a family, no one can increase or decrease the size of a house, a family, at will
It is because he has stopped meeting that we need to establish a meeting in his home, to 'deliver' the meeting to his home
For most of the saints, as long as a meeting is established in their homes, it will not be a problem for them to meet
The best way to recover a saint who has stopped meeting is to deliver the meeting to his home instead of asking him to come to a meeting
A wife who has stopped meeting for eighteen years might have been crying out for help the entire time but has been unable to find any help
If in three months we visit these two thousand homes three to five times, at least one thousand homes will be raised up
We need to encourage the saints to practice this change in the system moreover we must find a definite way to effectively gain the increase
In the past month the number of saints meeting in the small groups, that is, in the home meetings, has increased by one thousand
When a group of people are always together, they build up a feeling for one another and like to be close and intimate with one another
Within a year this family may be able to bring in fifteen people, and then they may increase to thirty or fifty
It is truly enjoyable to have many gathered together to sing and pray when the content and speaking of the meeting is very good
If there are presently six people in a home meeting, there would be one thousand small groups in the church in Taipei
If the elders are aggressive to take the lead, it will not be difficult for every home to gain one person a month
If every home gains a person each month, the church in Taipei will gain a thousand people in a month and twelve thousand in a year
If the Lord in whom we believe is not false and if He is worthy of our believing in Him we need to be serious absolute and faithful to Him
Besides the Lord's Day, which we set apart for the Lord, we should consecrate at least one evening to the Lord
In this way, the door of grace will be wide open for the spreading of the gospel and the genuine edification and exercise of the saints
Suppose a certain family has been very cold toward the Lord; it has been difficult to make the members of that family burning for the Lord
The home meeting every week will provide our children the best opportunity to receive spiritual nourishing and edification
Today in the Lord's recovery, there are still many saints who say they do not know how to speak for the Lord Jesus or preach Him
A home meeting requires neither orderliness, good appearance, nor eloquence; these are the requirements of being in an army
We should not carry out the home meetings sporadically; rather, we should do it steadily and continually, fifty-two times a year
Even though there may be conferences, trainings, and joint meetings, we should try not to interrupt the time of our home meeting
If one thousand homes in the church in Taipei maintain such a practice, the long-term impact and benefit will be immeasurable
They all love the Lord, their prayers are strong and clear, and their pursuit of the Life-study messages is excellent
The result will be that the entire family will become the Lord's good soldiers who work for the Lord to preach the gospel
If we bring our relatives and friends to the Lord, our relatives and friends will also bring their relatives and friends to salvation
Rather than holding gospel campaigns, He preached everywhere He went-by the shore, on the mountain, or in people's homes
He deliberately went to Samaria to bring the meeting to a Samaritan woman, and in so doing He brought salvation to her
Today we are influenced by the tradition of Christianity to the extent that we are tied down by its rules and formalities
If there were three million active homes in the fifty states of America, the whole of America would have been turned upside down
As long as we succeed in carrying out the home meetings, the church in our locality will be living, and the number will increase
In the suburb of Taipei, there is a Christian group that has experienced an increase of one thousand people in ten years
They put out messages for edification using the materials in the Lord's recovery and make them available to the believers free of charge
It seems as if we do not treasure the blessing that we have because we have been continually eating this good food for many years
Today in the church in Taipei there are almost five thousand saints, and not many of them participate in the church service
We have brothers and sisters in the churches who love the Lord, not only in the big cities but in smaller towns and villages as well
Today we must be realistic; we need to receive a practice that is according to the revelation in the Scriptures
By observing the situation in all of Christianity, we see that the Lord's riches are truly in our midst, in His recovery
At the same time, others have overtaken us because their practice is more advanced and because they use our truth
According to the statistics, the number of saints attending the truth classes is higher than that of the big meetings
For this reason, we need to learn how to make use of the rich material in the Lord's recovery in a living way, not in a formal, rigid way
Through the home meetings we can gain people, keep them, and at the same time carry out the functions of begetting, nourishing, and teaching
Revelation 3 says that the church in Laodicea thinks that she is wealthy yet does not realize that she is poor
Even though now we may seem unclear, as long as we are living, everything is fine; we should not worry too much
He might not be as experienced as we are, but this does not mean that his ability to do things is inferior to ours
We have always been faithful to the teaching of the Bible and have not been willing to take a way that is inconsistent with the Scriptures
We may have much spiritual learning, but as long as we have not been raptured, our fallen nature is still in us
According to our understanding, it seems as if an elder should serve his whole life, like a justice on the Supreme Court
If an elder is constantly learning and making progress and is truly an elder among the saints, this is all right
Some co-workers may feel that the old way is still better and that it is not good to change the system and have a new beginning
Up until today, however, we still have not witnessed a clear deliverance from the influence of that religious organization
Six thousand years of human history reveal that all people, whether cultured or barbaric, have a desire to worship God
There was no need for regulations forms organizations or institutions to help him for the living God was leading and guiding him directly
Genesis 4 shows clearly that the descendants of Cain invented human culture to satisfy man's need as a replacement for God
Eventually, however, man discovered that his greatest need was in his deepest part, his spirit, and this need he could not satisfy
Christianity once again lowered such a salvation from the Lord's standard to the level of a product of human culture
Not only are the world and humanity degrading day by day; even Christianity has become an ever-degrading religion
He became afraid and was discouraged to the point that he ran far away and asked to be allowed to die under a broom shrub
We have told the Lord, 'We would be the 'seven thousand' which You have reserved for Your own name in this age'
Because we have adopted this attitude and taken this ground, our actions and behavior have been a cause for some misunderstanding by others
Within three to five years after the Lord's recovery came to the United States, Christianity began to oppose us
It is because a little Chinese man has dared to blow the trumpet in the face of the colossus of American Christianity
We need to admit honestly that even until today we have not rid ourselves completely of the traditional influence of Christianity
Perhaps we think that the small group meetings would not have survived until today had there not been some 'core members'
To my feeling, it is the presence of these 'core members' that is crippling the small group meetings and limiting their development
If we are fair and compare the results, we will see that those small groups without 'core members' are actually thriving
We have been practicing this for more than a year and a half, yet we still have not seen any subdivision of the groups
To put the matter in a polite way, the elders and co-workers are too conservative and too faithful; they dare not let go
Eventually, they all wanted to go out to begin a work for the Lord, but the leader considered them unqualified and substandard
That brother was at one time greatly used by the Lord, but before he passed away, the church and the saints were almost choked to death
As time went on, he felt that the China Inland Mission was wrong because he had received light from the Brethren teaching
He worked in Chefoo for a few decades without experiencing any growth or advancement, and his group remained a small assembly
It is a good thing that there were other denominations in the Shantung province which were preaching the gospel and contacting people
The result of our way is that on the one hand our messages sound spiritual yet on the other hand we do not experience any growth or spread
The only reason for this failure is that we have bound ourselves up as with a chain, and this binding factor is our religion
There was the need to add a few brothers to the eldership, but it was impossible to raise up so many elders in a short time
The next year, in 1980, we considered the matter again, and the result was the same; no one was considered qualified
We waited in this way for six years, but there were still only a few who were considered qualified to be elders
Many times we would meet until eight or nine o'clock, eating a sack dinner along the way and continuing to meet after we ate
Only the Holy Spirit has the absolute right over the church, and only the Head is qualified to exercise control over the Body
Since we have changed the system everything that we do all the arrangements that we make and all the methods that we use are an experiment
In the past we were only responsible brothers in the various halls but now we are the elders and we may feel that we have been promoted
With some of us, our practice in the past was to allow the saints to meet in the homes only after we granted them permission
There is no need to visit the baptistery in the meeting hall very often; all the saints have bathtubs and water in their homes
During a recent gospel meeting, about fifty to sixty saints were baptized in the bathroom of the apartments above the meeting hall
It proves that we have been released from the bondage of religion and are on the way toward true scriptural practices
The reason for this is that the mother cannot tolerate the daughter's ineptness and tries to do everything herself
Brother Nee once said that after thirty years of age a man's character becomes set, and it becomes difficult for him to change
Some have asked, 'If the members of a small group include saints from other halls, how should we reckon their attendance?
If a church or a meeting hall has so many saints that no one can count them, this means it is growing; we worship the Lord for this
We need to pray for everyone and allow these five matters to operate and become effectual in the brothers and sisters
It is possible that at first we will have some confusion, but eventually the Lord will step in to do His work because this is His recovery
We should pay attention to one thing in this new practice; that is, we should be for vitality rather than uniformity
Hurry and hide the glassware, the pots and pans, and the ornaments, or they will all be wrecked and torn apart'
If a brother has committed a serious sin and has not come to a meeting for many years, we should not refer to his sin when we visit him
As long as a person is a child of God, he has the Lord's life in him, and this life will take care of the situation
Our most practical goal should be to stir up the saints house by house and to incite them to open up their homes
No matter how disorganized a home meeting is and no matter how low the condition of the meeting is, we should not be discouraged
The co-workers and the elders then must encourage the saints to dig into these messages and progress through them
At least there should be twenty minutes when everyone is together to pursue the message together in a living way
The same can be said of the weaknesses of the saints; because they cannot be cured immediately, we should go slowly
In the beginning we may not see much result, but over a long period of time the result will become quite obvious
When the saints come together, they are like a heap of coal, and the minute fire is applied, the whole meeting lights up
The gatherings generate a congenial atmosphere, but after such a meeting, not much of the Lord's word has been imparted into the attendants
Some who come early can receive the supply from the first section, and some who come late can receive the supply from the second section
We should accompany him to the door, read a portion to him, fellowship a little with him, and ask him to read the material when he gets home
As a result, everyone is concerned about the numbers in the group meetings and how these numbers should be reckoned
The numbers merely show us whether we are advancing or falling back, and even this is not a very accurate measurement
If we are focused on this goal, we will not carefully bargain about everything but will generously give our new ones away
Concerning the new ones, we need to prepare some material at the suitable time to lead them to know the church
If we hold on to our old concepts, many saints will be quenched from functioning in an organic way through our demand for uniformity
In the previous chapter, we spoke about dividing the four hundred home meetings in the church in Taipei into a thousand smaller units
With the division of this meeting into five smaller home meetings, everyone may become lost and the whole group may disband
Today, however, medical science has advanced so much that the average life span has increased to more than seventy years
My point is that we cannot congratulate ourselves merely with the fact that all the small groups have been subdivided into the homes
Of course, the number is encouraging, but we still need to pay attention to 'hygiene,' 'medical supplies,' and 'good nutrition'
He was able to grow up so well because his mother took good care of him; there was adequate attention given to hygiene and nutrition
Dear co-workers and elders, after we divide the small group meetings into the homes, we may expect all the home meetings to be tidy and neat
Do not think that since many have been dormant for a long time, something should be done to trim them a little
It does not matter whether they are skillful at taking the lead in the meeting, or whether they know how to sing
As long as we have the Lord's word and as long as we have His Spirit, there will be life, and life will enliven men
If we consider a person unqualified to begin a meeting in his home, that person may never again be able to open up his home
For this reason the co-workers and the elders must never be discouraged; they must have full confidence and a steady faith
After some time, however, when we add the pieces together again to see the whole, we will find that the total number has increased
After another two weeks the game may disappear altogether, and after another month the host may decide to burn the game
If we look back at that time, we will see that had we not brought the meeting to his home, he might still be playing cards
If we were with the Lord, we might have said, 'Lord Jesus, we heard of Your name, and we were told that You have a very successful work
Rather, we will immediately administer some 'booster shots'; we will do some 'CPR' by stirring up, encouraging, and consoling the saints
We must not be discouraged by anything, and the host of the home where the meeting is held must not be discouraged by anything
If we are shy and hesitating, we will only quench the fire, even quenching it quicker than any other person will
The Chinese who had just migrated to Brazil had very little else they could do because they could not understand Portuguese
They would wrap all kinds of Chinese goods inside a sheet and carry it on their backs, going from house to house to make sales
Whenever they saw someone coming to their door with a knapsack, they would open the door and invite the person to come in for tea
It does not matter if we are not able to make ourselves clear; we should simply repeat the same words a few more times
The land was donated by two overseas Chinese brothers, and we erected a temporary canopy with wooden beams for our meetings
Do not say that it is impossible to have a home meeting that has only one believer because the rest of the household worships idols
One characteristic of a Christian is that he can go against the tide and move forward by beholding the Lord's face
When the Lord charged the disciples to preach the gospel, He told them not to bring any shoes, staff, or money
All the elders, co-workers, and full-timers should learn to minister God's word to the home meetings at every opportune time
The minute we speak the Lord's word, His Spirit will follow such a word with His work, and there will surely be the result
When a seed falls into the ground after a period of time it brings forth flowers yet we cannot explain how the seed has grown and blossomed
When we speak to one person, we may not realize that in five years our word will produce results in that person
If we take care of people's situation by seizing the opportunity, we will meet the needs of all kinds of people
We may not have the absolute assurance that she will be healed, but we should believe that she will be comforted by the Lord's word
We cannot say under what condition a man is qualified to be baptized, nor can we say with surety what way we should baptize people
In order to achieve this goal, we need to do the following two things: First, we should not lose heart, not be discouraged, and not give up
Rather, we should be strong, be persistent, and have a will that does not settle for anything less than the determined goal
Although they may have drawn back or become cold because of their weaknesses or other reasons, they are nevertheless the Lord's children
Even those believers who no longer live like believers, but live like heathens, should have their names in this file
If we do this, a hall with two hundred members may suddenly find itself with more than five or six hundred names
After this the elders coworkers and fulltimers should take the lead to divide up the regular attendants into groups to make a grand sweep
The elders should call a meeting, gather the brothers and sisters together, and present the real situation to them
If all the brothers and sisters do this, even though we may not witness a complete success, the results will be decisive
They should charge the head of each household to pick up the burden to lead the entire family to pray for these names
To be sure, as long as that home will pray for these people, every spirit in that home will be revived and rekindled
We must pass out the records to the saints, take the lead in the practice, and supervise the work every step of the way
We should not promote anything, but we should look to the leading of the Holy Spirit and the prompting of the Lord
The older elders and co-workers among us have been 'waiting' and 'seeking' for the Lord's leading for more than thirty years
It is not a burdensome yoke for each family to take five names and joyfully visit them as believers in the Lord
In practice, when the saints go out to visit, we can tell them that they do not need to make all five visits in one evening
Now some of the Chinese are taking this same way in the United States; they give themselves to work, and they are making progress quickly
Today many Chinese students are ranked at the top not only at the college level but also at the high school level
Never think that as long as the elders come together to fast and pray for a week, the church will have a great revival
Even if a co-worker among us cannot be a Peter, one who now is dead and gone, he at least wants to be a Billy Graham or a Witness Lee
At the height of the rebellion, the unbelievers had a slogan: 'Among the Second Devils spare Chao Tu-nan; among the First Devils spare Mr
We must not think that we have consecrated ourselves to be a spiritual giant with a great name and a large following
Since the church is led by the Lord to practice the home meetings, we need to consider the homes as the goal of our work
We must not wait for the elders to make the arrangements, nor should we wait for the senior co-workers to take the initiative
If the saints pick up the burden to recover the dormant ones, they themselves will be firmly established and rooted
Do not think that all we need to do is to go to the homes and stir up people, and that there is not much to this work
With some people, we simply cannot do anything with them, yet when another person comes along, he is stirred up
Some jobs cannot be done by people with only a junior high education; they require someone with a higher education
On the one hand, we need to apply diligence toward people; on the other hand, we need to have the church meetings
In practice, if a church or a hall produces a full-timer, that church or hall should take care of that full-timer
We should try to find out if such ones should actually serve full-time and, if so, for how long and how they should be cared for
All parents know that even though all their children are their own offspring, they cannot treat them all in the same way
There are differences in condition, need, character, and disposition, and each must be treated properly according to his or her situation
We must exercise not to waste anything, spend little on ourselves, and save as much as we can so that we can care for others
On the other hand, the full-time serving ones should take care to maintain a clean living and an unfeigned conscience
If by the Lord's grace we do our best to give to others, the Lord will richly bless us and place us in abundance
In translating the book of Matthew we found out from the original language that the word hypocrisy actually means the putting on of a mask
In Greek this word means not merely a false show or pretense but the putting on of a mask or make-up; hence, it is a performance
Christianity has made all the life matters unclear and muddled, including the operation of the Spirit and the function of the Lord's word
The effectiveness of Christianity today depends fully on these four ways: organization, control, arrangement, and fund-raising
The enemy knows that if he fails to destroy the Lord's work through persecution, he can still resort to control through organization
The Lord has shown us clearly that while He was on earth, there was no organization, control, arrangement, or fund-raising
The Bible reveals to us that God gave man life and breath, and He wants man to receive Him as life by taking the tree of life
From the beginning of the Old Testament, we find these three things, but Judaism came in and gradually developed a kind of organization
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He did not have any meeting hall, yet He met with the disciples all the same
John came out of Judaism and rejected the legal Jewish formalities, but his disciples created a new religion based on his work
Later, when the person was gone, the Spirit, the life, and the word left also, and all that remained was the Methodist Church
He proposed that we overturn this tradition of having a Sunday morning message meeting and change it instead to a gospel meeting
Brothers, we should all be clear about this, and we should pick up this burden to return to our localities to speak and promote this
Of course, we must still take care of the big Lord's Day morning meeting because there are still some people who prefer the big meetings
We thank the Lord that recently all the big meetings have been changed to small meetings; each meeting has been split into different places
According to our old concept we wanted to see as many people as possible coming to the big meetings in order to gain new ones
If, however, the big meetings become bigger and bigger in number, we should find the reason that they are increasing
We still need to take care of these meetings, but our emphasis is the home meetings, and we must build up the home meetings
Whoever tries to be the leader is asking for trouble because the authorities focus their attention on the leaders
The most pressing need now is for all of us to promote this and to persuade others to do this in the various meeting halls
If we can do this, the home meetings will be successful, and the evangelization of Taiwan will be accomplished
If we are active in the new way and if we are hungry for the home meetings the ones who are saved through us will also be active and hungry
If we are indifferent and unconcerned about the new way, the ones who are saved through us will also be loose and unconcerned
In a positive sense, all the co-workers and elders from now on must be 'hungry wolves,' actively gaining people and caring for them
We must pray by fasting, saying, 'Lord, You must turn the church around absolutely from the old way of Christianity
If we do not work on the homes, and if we do not stir up every home, how can we answer to the Lord, and how can we answer to all the saints?
If we stir up the homes with the homes, and if we perfect the homes with the homes, soon twenty homes will be stirred up in a community
If we have three to five thousand people responding to this need, we will gospelize Taiwan in at least two years
Let us suppose that we can set up a center for meeting in every community, and every center takes care of fifty people
On the one hand, the brothers took my word and stayed away from free expounding, keeping themselves instead to teaching the text
In the same way today, while we are serving others, we must remove the 'feathers' and the 'skin' from the 'meat'
If someone merely focuses on the history when reading the Old Testament, he will be lost, unable to understand what he is reading
If we have the discernment, we will spontaneously pick up the meat, that is, the spiritual points and the points related to life
The main purpose of the material is to show everyone that all the prophets in the Old Testament spoke of Christ
We should speak, ask questions, and answer with our spirit, and we should read these portions with repetition and emphasis
The elders should not excuse themselves from this responsibility simply because others can teach better than they can
If the elders do not take the lead in teaching but assign this responsibility to others, they are acting contrary to God's word
If the elders only encourage others to speak, yet they themselves do not speak, they are left without any excuse
If we read the Bible carefully, we will find that there is not much mention of the affairs that the elders should handle
At that time the elders should take the lead even more in learning the truth, learning to speak, and teaching the truth
You should know the truth a little more than the saints so that you can fulfill your responsibility in the church
Sixty years ago there was a famous opera singer in Chinese drama; everyone knew him, but no one knew who his teacher was
The burden in this message is first to bring the church to the homes, and second to bring the saints into the truth
Those attending the truth classes have increased by twenty percent to the current number of three thousand five hundred
We cannot have home meetings without having small group meetings, that is, meetings that combine two or three families together
On the other hand, we need to encourage them to have spontaneous small group meetings in their neighborhood with a few other families
They do not need to meet every week they can meet once every two weeks for fellowship encouragement nourishment mutual help and inciting
Those who were saved in the big meetings did not have a good impression of or a strong inclination for the home meetings
The Mormon publications clearly state that its 'church' is built up by the efforts of its members in opening up their homes
In a home meeting, the son in the family can call a hymn, the daughter can lead the prayer, and the mother can begin the fellowship
It is not that as soon as we have a new book, we automatically pass it on to the homes and the groups for their study
It does not mean merely to distribute food according to the seasons but to distribute different kinds of food according to the varying needs
Suppose we meet a new one, and without any regard for his condition we begin to share with him about the seventy weeks in Daniel
It can spoil a person's appetite; the taste to come to the meeting will be spoiled because what he has heard has not benefited him
Whether or not a meeting brings profit to a person, attracts him, or stirs up the desire within him to join depends fully on this matter
In 1937 Brother Nee had a co-workers' meeting in Hankow to release the messages on The Normal Christian Church Life
Now he is going one step further; he is asking people to take his messages as reading material in the church meetings
One point needs special attention: In selecting the reading material, we should precede each portion with a few crucial verses
As the saints pray-read the Lord's words into them, these words become a deposit in them and serve as their timely supply
Even if there is not enough time, we should still take care of this, because this is an indispensable element of the meeting
If the whole congregation reads through half a message or an entire message together, that will kill the meeting
If the playing is capricious and there is no restriction and limitation, one can play for years and still not know how to play the game
The most effective way is to bring out the Lord's word and have everyone pray-read it, directing everyone to the main points
In order to achieve this, we need to continually lead the brothers and sisters to practice this in the meetings
If we appoint one person to read one paragraph and the next one to read another, we 'hang ourselves by a noose' with such a reading
While it is true that the teachers should not engage in long expositions, they ought to direct everyone to the main points
Some are worse; they allow the readers to mumble inaudibly over these crucial points and do not do anything to correct them
If the teachers cannot direct others to the main points and if they allow them to be glossed over, why do we need these teachers at all?
There are many prophets in the Old Testament, and whether they speak in types or in prophecies, their focus is Christ
When people look at lesson 14 of Truth Lessons, they will find that Micah's prophecies concerning Christ occupy only a few lines
He prophesied concerning the birthplace of Christ, when He was to become a man in time, and the goings forth of His Godhead from eternity
The main point of this lesson is that in the Old Testament there is a group of prophets who prophesied concerning Christ
When we compiled Truth Lessons, we put a special emphasis on this point in presenting the prophets of the Old Testament
If we can point out the focus of God's work in these eight persons, we will unveil the meaning of the entire book of Genesis
They think that the Bible is a book of history geography or science they have not pointed out the spiritual light hidden within these pages
The key to the success of the new way is the spiritual material we use in the home meetings and the way we teach Truth Lessons
Such big meetings kill the spiritual life of the believers as well as the function of the members of the Body of Christ
After fifty to sixty years of searching and groping, we still did not find the way to have the proper practice
During the past fifty or sixty years, we have been experimenting with the proper way, but we were not that accurate in our search
Now that we are suddenly changing everything to a new way, many of the brothers and sisters may feel uncomfortable about the change
Some have said that this new practice is something borrowed from the West and that it will not work in the Far East
Other co-workers have said that the new practice is suitable only for Taipei; it will not work in other places
The crucial thing concerning the new way is to have the Lord's salvation realized in a practical way by every saint
Without the home as a basis, it is difficult for individuals to exist, and it is difficult for a nation or kingdom to be established
We know that the book of Romans is a book dealing specifically with the spiritual life in Christ and the spiritual living in the church
We must not only open up the homes of those who are burdened, but we must also bring the meetings to the homes of those who are not burdened
Such meetings are not primarily for the relatives and neighbors but for the members of the family, especially for the husbands and wives
Although many brothers and sisters are not co-workers, elders, or full-timers, they do have a heart for the Lord
If they all form units of three, we will have one thousand units which can carry out meetings in others' homes
We can also encourage them to give a testimony of their salvation and to tell the story of their experience of the Lord's grace
Whether they are conscious sins or unconscious sins, we must ask the Lord to forgive and cleanse them one by one
The result of such prayer, confession, and supplication for cleansing is the moving and outpouring of the Holy Spirit
Whether it is singing, praying, speaking, or fellowshipping, the minute we open our mouth, we need to learn to exercise our spirit
Fifty years ago the most famous preacher in China was John Sung, who did not graduate from any theological school
At that time, even Christian congregations of a thousand people would be completely silent for the entire meeting
It seems that we are still not thoroughly clear about how to teach the main points of the lessons, and we do not know the secret of teaching
The reason is that the content of Truth Lessons is already a complete message which includes everything that should be included
As long as we are able to point out and impress people with the main points, this is the best way to teach Truth Lessons
The most important thing in our home meetings and small group meetings is for everyone to speak, as if they are passing a basketball
Some people may ask, 'Since we do not need to pay attention to all these things, why did you include them in the lessons'?
When we compiled Truth Lessons we included some of the bones feathers and skin but this does not mean that we want them to be taught
All of the co-workers and elders should be teachers of Truth Lessons, and especially the younger ones should bear this burden
We should teach the spiritual matters and things, such as the spiritual significance of Ur of the Chaldees being a land of idol worship
The husbands and the wives might have been arguing couples, but once they have meetings in their homes, they will stop their arguing
If possible, we should compile some material to teach the brothers and sisters how they should build up their own homes
A book as spiritual as Ephesians contains teachings on being proper husbands, wives, children, parents, slaves, and masters
All the brothers and sisters devoted their attention to the big meetings and neglected the building up of the homes
All the churches that do a good job with the homes will not need to have big gospel meetings; the gospel will spread spontaneously
At the same time, we need to encourage the brothers and sisters to group two or three families together into small groups
In the small groups they should fellowship together and render spiritual help, nourishment, and care to one another
After God's children are saved, if they pursue the truth, the church of the Lord will have a base and foundation and be built up in truth
We should consider the kind of transportation the teams will need-gospel vans, motorcycles, bicycles, or taking buses
At the present time they go door-knocking every Wednesday and Friday morning and visit people house to house in the apartment buildings
After the gospel and the churches have spread all over Taiwan, they may be led by the Lord to continue to serve full time or to find a job
They need to be faithful to this 'military' service in these five years until every town, village, and hamlet in Taiwan is gospelized
Some American saints even have signed up to participate in the construction work of the big meeting hall when it begins
Many Christians confess, and even those in Christianity in America cannot deny, that the Lord has entrusted us with His truth in this age
The foremost need on the battlefield is to be watchful and alert, in order to know what the enemy is doing and what he intends to do
We also need to pray for our general meetings such as the big Lord's Day morning meeting, the Lord's table meeting, and the prayer meeting
In this coming term of the training we will teach different languages, including Greek, English, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese
We need to remember that in God's work, there is no such thing as sheer luck, no such thing as gaining without effort
We should not listen to the lies from the authorities of darkness; instead, we should offer prayers to God in steadfast faith
They should be short and living, adding to the one before, so that all the prayers can be joined together as one strong, powerful prayer
On the one hand, in the natural realm, our strength and energy are limited, and we should not overuse our body
On the other hand, in the spiritual realm, when this kind of thing happens, we should not rule out the attack of the enemy
May the Lord bless the books we put out so that they can be effective and greatly used by the Lord to reach His goal
Lord, we are not asking this for ourselves or merely for the church, we are asking this for You and Your interest
We ask You to draw the boundary around us with Your precious blood and not allow the authorities of darkness to overstep
If there are some who oppose us before You, they are not opposing us, they are opposing Your new way and Your work
Since we are here fighting the battle, we ask You to grant us the inner peace so that we may enjoy Your fighting and rest in Your fighting
Lord, we believe that for Your sake and for the sake of Your interest on the earth, You will answer our prayers
Some of us may not know how to teach at the present time, but as long as there is the heart to learn, eventually we will be able to teach
There will be forty days from the end of this term of the full-time training until the beginning of the next term
If possible, we should arrange for some of them to attend the summer training on The Conclusion of the New Testament
In the Old Testament, as far as God's economy is concerned, God's work was to build up the temple and the city
John Bunyan was one of the most famous spiritual preachers among the Baptists in England in the seventeenth century
The purpose of the book is to teach people how to oppose Satan when he attacks and how by faith they can withstand his temptations
They realize from the depth of their being that every step of God's recovery involves His enemy, and every step requires warfare
Today we need to see that there is the need to engage ourselves in spiritual warfare for the building up of God's kingdom
After the Israelites left Egypt and arrived at Mount Sinai, Moses saw the vision of the building of God's tabernacle
Rather, their journey in the wilderness was orderly and disciplined, and it was always centered around God's tabernacle
From the book of Numbers we can see that when they set up their camp, the first thing they did was set up the tabernacle
After the tabernacle was established as the center, all the tribes settled around it according to a prescribed order
Only those who were between thirty and fifty years old were numbered and drafted into the service of the tabernacle
Without the good land, how could God's temple be built, His city established, and His kingdom set up on earth?
He fought battles in the north and in the south, subduing all the enemies within the land and establishing peace
At the same time, he prepared materials for the building of the temple, materials that he captured through his many battles
David's warfare not only secured a foundation for the temple; it also secured all kinds of materials for its building as well
He stirred up the Egyptians to attack Jerusalem; the Assyrians and eventually the Babylonians were stirred up to destroy Jerusalem
These people captured and destroyed Jerusalem, destroyed the temple, and took the holy people away as captives
At that time, God's house was gone, His kingdom was gone, and His people were taken into captivity for seventy years
Verse 21 says, 'So we labored in the work; and half of them held spears from the start of dawn until the stars came out'
In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said that the gates of Hades, which belong to Satan, would never prevail against the built-up church
He speaks about the church as the Body of Christ the fullness of Christ the counterpart of Christ the new man Gods house and Gods kingdom
Paul saw the churches that he had built up with his own hands being damaged by Satan and brought into desolation
When he wrote the books of Philippians, Colossians, and 1 and 2 Timothy, he was very clear about the situation
It is, on the negative side, to defeat and destroy the winds of different teachings, and on the positive side, to carry out God's economy
Paul clearly points out that it is insufficient merely to not teach different things; we must also speak God's economy
In 6:12 Paul says, 'Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life, to which you were called'
There is no need to exert any strength; we can easily glide along, but to swim upstream requires a continual struggle
Today the church has been corrupted by Christianity to such an extent that it has fully become a religion and an organization
The Catholic Church takes the pope as its head, and the different Protestant groups take their founders as their heads
We have been fighting this battle for more than sixty years, but to a certain extent, even our own brothers and sisters are not clear
We need to admit that two years ago in 1984 the clergy-laity system was very strong among us, even here in Taiwan
Once the meetings move to the homes and the church life is established in the homes, the clergy-laity system will have no more ground
Once they are transplanted to the homes, there will be no further opportunity for the clergy-laity system to surface
If every home has a meeting, every person is speaking, and no one wants to be the head, how can the clergy-laity system remain?
If we cannot achieve these three ends, the clergy-laity system will remain, and the religious organization will continue
The clergy-laity system is the very root of the big meetings, and the big meetings are the 'tree' for the clergy-laity system
Some people are saved and are even edified built up and helped in the Catholic Church others experience the same thing in the denominations
Later by the Lord's mercy we all left them, but regrettably, we now find ourselves building up what we left behind
We should check: After practicing the small groups and the home meetings for a year and a half, what kind of meeting do we appreciate?
The conferences are also not the big meetings, because these conference meetings are called for a special purpose
The joint Lord's table meetings are also not the big meetings; they are initiated when there are special needs
The big meetings that we are talking about here are the regular church meetings where one speaks and everyone listens
Although the brothers and sisters do not oppose our promotion of the home meetings, neither do they respond enthusiastically
While Nehemiah was building the wall, others apparently were not opposing him, yet they were actually pouring cold water on his work
In some halls or churches, as soon as the co-workers or elders speak of the home meetings, everyone responds favorably
In some other places, however, when the brothers say, 'This is the Lord's up-to-date leading,' nothing happens
Sometimes we hear reports that the home meetings are few in number and poor in attendance, and we think that everything is hopeless
Sometimes he avoids a 'hot' war, and sometimes he even avoids a 'cold' war; he simply brings in a war of confusion
Rather, he blows a little draft here and there, causing some to say, 'Thank the Lord, our home is open, but regrettably no one comes'
The fact that the elders do not have a watchful and prayerful spirit means that they have come under the spell of the messengers from Satan
Currently, we do not sense much of the move of the Spirit, because we have not rendered Him adequate cooperation
At the present time in Taiwan, my goal, on the one hand, is to study how to advance in the new move with the co-workers and elders
At the same time, it was impossible to recruit some useful ones from the Lord's recovery and put them to use immediately
Even if we selected a few young ones and started training them, they would still need to pass through a period of training and perfecting
If we do this, the clergy-laity system will be gone, and all the saints will know, speak, preach, and teach the truth
It is through multiplication in the family that the church continues to prosper and spread generation after generation
Those among us who have been loving the Lord and serving Him for decades have surely witnessed our families being blessed by the Lord
When Jacob was about to go down to Egypt, he first offered a sacrifice in Beer-sheba and consecrated himself to the Lord
The purpose of doing this is not only to save a few more souls and edify some saints but to build up the Lord's church in the homes
We must have a strong resolution within ourselves that even if we must sell everything, we need to increase the number of full-timers
When the full-timers hear this word, they should bow down to worship the Lord, and they should also serve with fear and trembling
In twenty-three years, more than a hundred churches have been raised up in South America, North America, Europe, Africa, and Australasia
On their part, the full-timers should be faithful in the way they handle money, and they should also take care of others
If today in Taipei we can reach the high ground of the new way, we will have secured a great victory for the Lord's recovery
If the relatives of the Lord Jesus had not testified of this, we would never imagine that the Lord could be beside Himself for a meeting
We would have thought that the Lord met in an ordinary way and that the tone of His teaching was gentle and mild
The expression beside Himself, as in Mark 3:21, means that one is away from himself; he is delivered from himself
Before we can speak to people, we must know how to begin the meeting properly and how to make people 'come alive'
In 2 Corinthians 5:13 Paul said, 'Whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you'
In our daily life we should be sober, but in the meetings, in order to glorify God, we must be beside ourselves and ecstatic for God
History shows that Christianity has been under the influence of deadness, darkness, dryness, and desolation for a long time
Since the day that the Lord raised us up in China, the light among us has been clear; we know that it is the Lord who has raised us up
He wants us to overturn the formalism of Christianity, the deadness of the Brethren, and the wildness of the Pentecostal movement
Regrettably, the co-workers have not been sufficiently infused and impressed with these characteristics in the Lord's recovery
We may have been saved in the Lord's recovery, but we still bear within our being the things that have ensnared Christianity
The co-workers have been under my training for the past thirty years, but even today not too many are beside themselves
Brother Nee once said that if a Christian has never been beside himself once before God, he is not qualified to be called a proper Christian
Today when the full-timers visit people in the communities, they cannot act crazy when they come to people's doors
Whether we are visiting the communities or going to a meeting, we must prepare ourselves by first being crazy at home
At times he would hold out an opium pipe and sing, 'Down with the pipe, down with the pipe; out with opium, out with opium'!
Finally, he would make the call, saying, 'All those who want to be finished with these things, please come to the front'
We must first pray thoroughly, confess our sins, and be cleansed before we can be filled with the Lord and His riches
In order to be crazy, we must first confess our sins, repent, pray, enjoy the Lord, contact Him, and be filled and clothed with His riches
After doing this once or twice, the saints will not need to wait for us to take the lead to be crazy; they themselves will become crazy
If the co-workers and elders do not know how to be crazy and beside themselves, how can they lead the churches?
In order for the churches to go on, there must be proper leadership, and in order to have proper leadership, the elders must be crazy
If we are persons who live and walk in the spirit, as soon as we walk into the meeting the atmosphere will be changed
If we do not use our spirit our teaching of Truth Lessons will be nothing but dead reading dead teaching dead speaking and dead listening
We meet to release our spirit and to fellowship with one another in the spirit, receiving spiritual supply and spiritual infilling
They should pray and sing in threes and fives to stir up their spirit and to enliven the atmosphere of the meeting
With regard to teaching Truth Lessons, the focus is on the transmission of the Spirit and the dispensing of life
The real teaching of the truth is the transmitting and dispensing of the Spirit and life that is in the truth into people
Every point in the summary is the truth, every word is precious, and every sentence is excellent and full of life and light
For many years we have received a burden from the Lord to rid ourselves of the traditional way of meeting and have a proper practice
Although we should ask one another questions and mutually answer and study in groups, we must still emphasize the sharing at the end
The purpose of learning the truth is to minister life and transmit the Spirit; it is not to find fault or simply study the wording
It is sufficient for us to understand the high school curriculum we do not need to know the things that will be taught in graduate school
The most impressive thing is that all of their young people are in suits and are neat and tidy, giving people a very positive impression
Once one enters their compound, everything is orderly and regulated, and there are even attendants in the parking lot directing cars
Many highly educated people agree with them, and many rich people like to hire members who belong to their group
We have the truth and life, but because our method is inappropriate, we lack a proper practice to represent us
Today in Taiwan, people in the industrial, commercial, political, military, and academic fields are aggressively making changes
The foundation of the entire church is the home meetings, and the key to successful home meetings is the teaching of the truth
If we are successful in establishing these two meetings, we will be able to spread to the communities, towns, and villages
In the big gospel meetings that we have held in stadiums, we gained quite a number of people, but in the end only a few remained
When the saints coordinate together to go door-knocking, the result is better than that of the big gospel meetings
Presently the full-time trainees go door-knocking twice a week in the communities; later they will propagate in the towns and villages
In the past He gave us so many rich truths, but if we do not give Him the way today, He will not have a way to advance
He was able to labor more abundantly to bring God's economy to His children, not by himself but through the grace of God which was with him
At the end of this portion, in verse 58, he drew his conclusion, testifying that any labor and work in the resurrected Lord is not in vain
Although we have not yet fully emerged out of the old 'womb,' at least by now a certain new shape has taken form
Not only did the number of churches increase rapidly, but the recovery was also spread throughout the entire island
They will have learned the best techniques, and they will be trained to spread the Lord's gospel throughout all the towns
They will work in one hundred towns, visiting people and delivering the gospel and the meetings to the homes two by two
In this way, in five months we will establish churches in all three hundred eighteen towns throughout the island
The most important thing is to build up the gospel and the church meetings in the homes of all the new believers
The condition in the land of Judea after the Lords resurrection and ascension at the time of Pentecost was not similar to what we have today
Saints from dozens of churches in Europe, Africa, and America can gather together and use the telephone to enjoy sweet fellowship
We look to the Lord desperately and pray that His blood would cover all of us to fight the battle for God's kingdom here in this land
Even if we cannot serve full time for our whole life, we can at least try and serve full time during the ten years of our gospelizing Taiwan
If we take the old way, how many elders and co-workers will we need to appoint to take care of one hundred twenty thousand people?
In the future the full-time training will be carried out in the Full-time Training Center in hall three of the church in Taipei
In order to meet the need of the full-time training and of the gospelization of Taiwan, there is a great need of financial support
The Lord willing, we should even specify the way we should dress and the way furniture should be arranged in the meeting
Some may say that if we do this, we will be like those in James 2, who respect persons and prefer the rich to the poor
In the same way, if some saints are not able to dress properly, the rich ones should offer money to take care of them
If He had dressed like a pauper, the soldiers would have thrown His garment away; they would not have fought over it
Concerning the teaching of the truth, the Lord's recovery should be the most qualified and experienced among the Christian groups in Taiwan
Our Truth Lessons have rich main points, clear outlines, simple and concise language, and are easy for new believers to understand
If we can present the truth properly and clearly, based upon this well respected 'classic,' others will rise up to admire it
We are not the only ones who have noticed this phenomenon; the denominations are also paying attention to these new developments
We have always boldly declared that we are for the campus work, but what has been done on the top campus in the country?
We want to be faithful to Him; for more than two or three decades we have given up everything and consecrated our all to Him
According to my observation, we have managed to hold on to a certain attainment; we have maintained a certain amount of truth and life
When a nation launches a project it cannot spend too much time calculating the cost involved it can only count on the success of the project
In order to pick up the burden and to spread the work aggressively, we need to match God's work with our material supply
In addition to taking care of their living, they also give away books and booklets to their contacts and the new believers
At that time there were twelve members in my family, but we lived in a studio that was big enough for only eight beds
When the Lord returns, we will be in trouble if the treasure within us is not dug out and the talents are not utilized
May they consecrate everything on the altar for Your love's sake and for the sake of fulfilling Your work in this age
May You gain a clear highway in Taiwan and gain a glorious testimony on this earth to be a model to all the churches
Lord, we offer up our worship, thanksgiving, and praise for Your recovery, for Your move among us, and for Your leading
May there be no veil, no shadow, and no hindrance within us, and may we be altogether shining within and without
May Your light shine brighter and brighter, and may it be like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until the full day
You have promised us that whatever we bind will be already bound in heaven, and whatever we loose will be already loosed in heaven
Destroy the power of darkness so that You can carry out the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in all the places
Although we have not been as strong as we would like, we have done our best to take care of the increase in the localities
In Taipei we began the practice of turning from the small group meetings to the home meetings at the beginning of this year
Although the rate of increase has not come up to our expectation, it is nevertheless a great encouragement to us
Now under the Lord's new leading, we must pay attention to the building up of the church in all the localities by increasing our number
As long as a person is a believer he is our brother in the Lord even if he is the weakest coldest and most indifferent backslidden person
The scriptural basis for the small groups and the home meetings is the expression from house to house in Acts 2:46 and 5:42
Based on this, we were bold to say that we must have the small meetings, the group meetings, not only the big meetings
According to my observation however the brothers in Taiwan and the United States have misunderstood the meaning of the small group meetings
They do not understand the small group to mean the home meetings, but merely a few brothers and sisters from the same area meeting together
We should not use the big meetings, nor the small meetings, nor meetings with two or three to preach the gospel
We should no longer pay that much attention to bringing people to the gospel meetings for them to listen to someone preach the gospel
At the end of the meeting they usually fly away like birds in the air; with a 'goodbye' they are gone, and there is no way to keep them
Today there are many new urban communities in Taipei consisting of blocks and blocks of high-rise apartment buildings
Of course, some turn away from us, but it is difficult to find one family that strongly opposes the gospel, the Bible, or the Lord Jesus
Sometimes we can find some dormant saints, and when we begin talking to them about the Lord, their cold hearts are rekindled
One point worth noting is that with our present practice we can immediately arrange for the next visit with the new ones
The advantage is that we bring salvation not only to an individual but to a home, even to relatives and friends of that home
In the new leading of the Lord, we first build up everything related to the church in the homes and not in the meeting halls
In our changing the system, the home meetings and the truth-teaching meetings are the two most basic and crucial meetings in the church life
These two kinds of meetings can be carried out in the districts, in the small groups, or when the whole church comes together
The first Lord's Day of every month, all the saints in a particular hall should gather together for the Lord's table meeting
During the bread-breaking meeting we can choose some practical, concise, and meaty portions for everyone to pray-read and enjoy
For the prayer meeting we can choose some messages on service that open up the basic spiritual principles of service
In the home meetings there should be some short messages for edification besides the fellowship, prayer, hymns, and greetings
We do not like to see people come to our meetings without learning something of God's Word or without God's Word being ministered to them
In particular, the Chinese people love Psalm 1; nothing in Confucius's teaching has the sweetness that this psalm has
Timothy 2 teaches us that we should dress soberly, not adorning ourselves with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly clothing
When others see us dressed in this way, they will open the door and welcome us, and it will be easy for them to receive what we have to say
Afterward she told the saints that her husband worked in Tainan and asked how the gospel could be preached to him as well
The saints told her that Tainan has a church with many believers and that they could take his name and deliver the gospel to him
We can use short twenty-minute videotapes to help the new ones, or we can take advantage of the telephone and teach them over the phone
Where in Christianity can we find another group of people who have received as much truth from the Lord as we have?
We will form these two thousand five hundred people into an army and will evangelize all the towns and villages of Taiwan
We hope that by 1988 we will have at least a thousand full-timers who are well equipped and trained to go out to spread the work
After much consideration before the Lord, we propose to initially send these one thousand full-timers out in one hundred teams
They will go to one hundred towns and will work for a month in the new way visiting people preaching the gospel and building up the church
The remaining three hundred sixty will return to the big cities to work with others in the community visitation
In five years we will spread a big net over the entire island of Taiwan, a net of the gospel, a net of truth, and a net of the church
Communication is well developed the standard of living is high the educational level is excellent and peoples hearts are open to the gospel
If all these eighteen thousand saints rise up and consecrate themselves to function in an organic way, the dormant ones will follow
Everyone will be driven to pray, and everyone will offer himself to take advantage of the golden opportunity that the Lord has provided us
Lord, we desire to learn to fulfill our function as members of the Body and to promote Your new way under Your love and Your grace
May You have a strong and powerful testimony at the end time before Your return, a testimony that will affect the entire earth
In Christ Jesus and by the Holy Spirit, we want to be priests, offering every saint in the churches under our care to You as a sacrifice
May we all receive this burden to pray and to call on You day and night, until we see the New Jerusalem appearing as the praise of the earth
Show the world a living testimony that is different from Christianity, a testimony that is the living expression of Yourself
Lord, grant all the saints this burden, the adequate prayer, a thorough appreciation, and a strong consecration
Those who are shallow in their understanding argue that the Bible is not consistent and that many passages do not agree with one another
If we study the four Gospels, we will see that there are actually more than four ways to describe the Lord Jesus
If we dive into God's word and dig into its depths, we will see that our God is very consistent, yet He is not simple
With such faculties man is able to express God, receive God, mingle with God, and become one with God on earth
If the body that God created is so complicated yet consistent, the God who created it should be even more complicated yet consistent
The completion of the New Testament was followed by the first generation of scholars known as the church fathers
According to our research, these church fathers were higher and deeper than modern scholars in their understanding of the truth
With Him there is not only the distinction of three and one but also the distinction of His economical aspect and His essential aspect
The Bible does not merely say, 'That which has been conceived in her' but 'that which has been begotten in her'
The Holy Spirit is not only the essence that brought about the Lord Jesus' conception; He is the very One who was begotten in Mary
With such a consideration, we can readily understand the words of John 1:1 and 14: 'In the beginning was the Word
Luke 1:35 proves this: 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you'
Even if we read this portion a thousand times, we will not be aware of the mystery and reality of God's birth within man
He had to be killed on the fourteenth day of the first month during the Passover at Mount Moriah, which is Mount Zion
Since a man needs a certain number of days to travel from Galilee to Jerusalem, He made arrangements ahead of time
The Old Testament prophesied concerning His move, and He acted and made preparations accordingly to match the prophecy
It is we, such small people, who are involved in this work, and for this reason, there is truly the need for a schedule and a plan
Of course, we can get by with seven hundred, but the timing will be prolonged, the manpower stretched, and the impact reduced
After three years of preparation and training, the Northern Expedition for the unification of China began in 1926
We will then have a sufficient number not only to gospelize the towns but also to gospelize all the villages in another five years
In order to reach our goal, all the elders and responsible brothers in all the churches need to pick up the burden in one accord
Next when we say that out of twenty saints we should have one fulltimer we are taking into consideration the source of our financial support
The nineteen saints should set aside five percent of their income to support the living of the one full-timer among them
Our statistics show that we are barely obtaining the number of full-timers we need and our financial offering is still inadequate
Although we are faithful in our regular offerings, we need to set aside five percent to support the full-timers
May the Lord be gracious to all the saints in all the places, and may we set our eyes on this in steadfastness and one accord
Now the Lord is leading us to take a new way, which will enable us to achieve maximum results with less effort
At present there are approximately two hundred sixty full-time trainees, which is seven hundred short of our target of one thousand
We cannot merely gather a group of people who do not have much knowledge, learning, or experience and send them to visit people in the towns
Even though we are ordinarily dressed, we gain people's respect by being orderly, graceful, and dignified in our attire
In this way, the gospel and truth will have a way to go out, and our elegance and gravity will accompany our publications
The mirror on the wall seemed as if it had not been dusted since the day it was hung, and everything in the room was topsy-turvy
Later the church in Hong Kong formed a building group to purchase a piece of land for the building of a meeting hall
Now since Hong Kong Island has undergone much development, any further development will be on the Kowloon side, where Tsim Sha Tsui is
Because Tsim Sha Tsui will be the center of both Hong Kong and Kowloon sides, you must purchase this piece of land as soon as possible'
The land was about forty-six hundred square feet, at about NT$8 per square foot, and was located at the center of Kaoshiung
Since God is holy and glorious and our coming to the meetings is like coming to the holy land we must have the attitude to dress properly
We are not imposing outward regulations, but we hope the brothers and sisters will have a clear realization and receive a proper leading
Today people with achievements, whether in the educational, industrial, or commercial fields, have proper and decent homes
Mormons are very attractive in their family and personal lives, as well as in their conduct, behavior, and appearance
They claim that Jesus Christ is not God but merely a noble and outstanding man and that they learn from His conduct
They are obviously heretical, but because they are honest, reliable, and well-behaved, they have spread in a prevailing way
Thirty years ago they had one million members but now they have four million many of whom are upper class people such as lawyers and doctors
We have the truth, life, and the gospel as real diamonds, but we should not wrap them with tissue paper and sell them to people
Even though we may have the real diamonds, if we wrap them with tissue paper, no one will believe they are real diamonds
For this reason, there is a class in the full-time training that teaches the trainees to dress in a proper, neat, and tidy way
If we dress strangely, wear our tie sloppily, and leave our hair unkempt, even though we speak the truth, no one will listen to us
Only when a person has proper facial features, good manners, and neat clothing can he appropriately represent his country
If the Lord wills, after the meeting hall in Lin-ko is completed, we will move the training center there, and it will be on a larger scale
Christians still need big meetings, because the atmosphere of the big meetings can never be replaced by small meetings
According to the principle in the Old Testament, God ordained that His people gather in Jerusalem three times a year
Some high-peak truths cannot be released from house to house through the ministry; rather, they need to be released in the big meetings
