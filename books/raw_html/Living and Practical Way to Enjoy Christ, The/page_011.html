<P>Do not think that you need more teachings from the Bible. Do not think that you need some training about how to serve the Lord, how to preach the gospel, and how to work for the Lord. I am desperate to cause you all to be crazy lovers of Jesus. I have no burden to give you some new doctrine, some new message. I am burdened to make you all the crazy lovers of Jesus. I care for only one thing&#151; that you have to love Jesus in a crazy way.</P><P>Every lover is a crazy one. If you are sober in your mind to love someone, your love must be false. We have a proverb which says, "Love blinds." In a sense, I have the burden to blind you, not to make you so clear. When Eve and Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, their eyes were opened and they became clear (Gen. 3:5-7). On the other hand, when Jesus came into Saul of Tarsus, his eyes were blinded (Acts 9:8). Love blinds. Do not try to be clear. You have to lose your sight. When Jesus catches you, you become blind to everything except Him. Today this generation does not need a lot of clear young people. It needs a lot of crazy young lovers of Jesus.</P><P>There is no other way for the Lord Jesus to take full possession of you. I cannot teach you to be like this. But I do know that if the Lord Jesus shows Himself to you with His beauty, His fairness, you will be fully taken over by Him. Then you will forget everything. You will be fully possessed by Christ. You should be crazy to such an extent that you do not have the consciousness that you are crazy. You are crazy without a sense of being crazy, but you have the full sense of Christ. This is the kind of person this generation needs for the Lord's recovery.</P><P>You should have no thought of serving the Lord in a religious way or of behaving yourselves in an ethical way. You should know only to love the Lord Jesus. If you are the Lord's crazy lovers, your whole being from within will be fully occupied by Jesus. Your feeling, your will, your decision, your intention, your motive, your intent, and everything within you will be fully taken over by Jesus. I do not want to pass on more and more teachings and doctrines to you. I want to make you blind, to make you crazy lovers of Jesus.</P><P>Every continent needs such lovers. We need to be crazy with Jesus for the whole earth. Every place needs some Jesus-lovers. Do not care for your living, your destiny, or your future. Your destiny is to love Jesus, to be crazy for Jesus. Every city, every state, and every country needs a bunch of crazy young lovers of Jesus. If you all are such lovers, the number of attendants in your meetings will always be increasing. You all need to be the crazy lovers of Jesus! This is what today's generation needs.</P>
