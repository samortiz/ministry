   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Properties, Houses, and Valuables to Be Sold</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As for properties, houses, and valuables, they have to be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anything special should be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Properties, houses, as well as other forms of tangible assets such as jade, antiques, and calligraphy collections must be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After they are sold, the proceeds should be given to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>D. Nothing to Be Held in Private</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In regard to the rest of your belongings, whatever you need to keep to take care of your daily necessities does not have to be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet you must have the attitude that all of God's children can share all of these things with you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me tell you something about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can take this as a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For about twenty years, I have had the habit of buying everything in quantity, half a dozen or a dozen at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some brothers wonder why I always buy in quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, when I buy a pair of sunglasses, my intention is, of course, to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet I also pray, "God, since You intend to supply me with sunglasses, please supply me with six pairs."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not have peace unless I pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then when a brother in need comes along, I give him a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If another brother comes along, I give him another pair.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I give away five pairs and keep one for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way I keep my peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I buy pocketknives, I always buy a dozen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I buy razors, I always buy a case of twelve dozen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do this because if I only buy one, it will have the flavor of doing something for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if I give one to you when you come, and I give another to another brother when he comes, there is a much sweeter flavor to the whole purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, I cannot give to a thousand or a million people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But by giving away a little, the flavor becomes different.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I buy a dozen pocketknives, and eleven brothers come to me, I can give each of them one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can keep the last one, and God will probably give me the liberty to use it freely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I do not do this, there will always be a nagging feeling that I am keeping something for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who have stayed with me for any length of time know what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever I go shopping, I always buy in dozens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I do not use in dozens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once I let go of my possessions, there is a sweet flavor to whatever I do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>E. Practicing the Principle</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>of Having All Things in Common</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should learn not to hold on tightly to our own possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe the Lord will not allow me to keep my coat forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps tomorrow it will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since that is the case, I might as well ask the tailor to make a few more for me; then I can give some away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should try our best to build up this feeling among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every time we shop, we should not plan for ourselves only.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should always think of others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to shop.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not saying that we should not shop.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when we shop, we should cultivate this feeling, the flavor of having all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am not saying that we have to practice the very act of having all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am saying that we have to keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Always think of others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must always uphold the principle of having all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>F. Learning Not to Take Root</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>or to Be Stingy before God</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All new believers should learn this lesson before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have special possessions or objects, we should sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All real estate, gold, or silver should be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not like to see believers owning gold, silver, properties, or houses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such things always tempt us to take root in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet it is not enough to simply get rid of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people have sold their properties, but it is hard to borrow a fountain pen from them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not easy to be delivered from the world!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are many stingy men in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are stingy, not only in the big things, but in the small things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are stingy in every little item and every little detail.</S>
