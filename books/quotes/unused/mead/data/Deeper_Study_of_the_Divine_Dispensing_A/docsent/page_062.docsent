   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE APOSTLES' STEWARDSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The dispensing began with God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the ages God, in the universe, had a desire in Himself, which was to work Himself into His chosen, created, redeemed, and regenerated people that He might be their life and their divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although they are human, these people are born of God to have God's nature and God's life and to thus become God's genuine children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As such, these people become God's expression, and this expression becomes the Body of Christ, which is also the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This fullness is the riches of the Triune God fully worked into His chosen, regenerated, and transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to accomplish this, God in His economy must have an arrangement and a plan, and He must find some faithful and useful ones and entrust this responsibility to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among them the most important group are the first apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God gave them the stewardship so that they would be responsible to dispense all the riches of Christ to God's children, that is, to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul's fourteen Epistles are a full revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They show how Paul and his co-workers carried out the stewardship of distributing the riches of Christ in God's great household through the writing of the fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These Epistles bring in an unsearchable and ever-fresh dispensing throughout the ages, even until today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tonight, in this little meeting, what we are doing and touching is this same dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are gathered into His name, that is, we are in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we gather around His Word to consider the revelation in the Word, and especially the vision revealed in the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we see this vision, we will realize that our need is the riches of Christ dispensed to us by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not need any spiritual cultivation or any reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We only need to receive this divine dispensing from Paul again and again in a slow and steady way from morning to evening and from evening to morning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Practically speaking, Christ in resurrection is the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, everywhere and all the time, He can enter into us, be with us, and be our life and our element within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most Christians today have left the proper truth and have turned from the inward dispensing of Christ to human work, merits, and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We ourselves have been under this influence and are not free from it even up to today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we read something from the Bible, we make up our mind to do and to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, such determination should be condemned and rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not want us to determine to do what the Bible says; He only wants us to receive His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here I would like to read to you Hymns, #501.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This hymn expresses very well what I want to say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 1 says:</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>O glorious Christ, Savior mine,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thou art truly radiance divine;</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God infinite, in eternity,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet man in time, finite to be.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ, expression of God, the Great,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a One is for our enjoyment, and not for our imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God mingled with humanity</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lives in me my all to be.</S>
