   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>20 THE WALL IN GOD'S LIKENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our twentieth point concerns the wall which surrounds the city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wall's appearance is jasper Rev 21:18 , the same as the description of God's appearance in Revelation 4:3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the wall of the city expresses God's likeness, God's appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>21 THE SEPARATION AND PROTECTION OF THE WALL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The twenty-first point relates to the purpose of this wall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Its function is to separate that which is holy from that which is common, to separate that which belongs to God from that which does not belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a separating wall is also a protection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The wall of any house is a separating factor, separating that which is within from that which is without, and such a separation protects all within the house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The wall of the holy city is a real separation: everything within this wall is holy, and everything without is common.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This wall also affords full protection to all within the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's very appearance is the separating factor of this wall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more a local church is in the likeness of God, the more it is separated from the world and everything common.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How do we acquire God's likeness?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can acquire God's likeness only by God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the life of God flows within us, we will be in His very likeness, and His likeness will be the separating power of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why is Christianity so similar to the worldly communities of today?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because there is practically nothing about most of those in Christianity in the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most Christians lack God's likeness without because they lack the flow of His life within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, God's life must flow within us that we may bear His likeness without!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will cause the church to be separated from the common and worldly things, and at the same time this will protect us from so many injurious influences.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>22 THE BUILDING OF THE WALL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Next, this separating wall, as the protection to the city, needs to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not happen overnight, for this wall is built of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The real building of the church is in this matter of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The city, which is all of gold, signifies the divine nature, and this nature does not involve much building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the gates of the city are pearls, which do indicate some amount of building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The wall, however, is the main part of the building of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have seen, this wall as the separating and protecting factor, is in the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is one hundred forty-four cubits high, that is, twelve times twelve, which signifies completion in completion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The wall is indeed high.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people accuse us of having such a high wall and giving the appearance of being sectarian; yet we must have such a high wall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most of the time our wall is not high enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must have a wall one hundred and forty-four cubits high to keep out everything common, and this wall must be built with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is quite easy to find mud to produce clay bricks, but it is extremely difficult to find precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may easily produce a large quantity of clay bricks overnight, but in one month's time we can hardly acquire one piece of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Precious stones require much transformation work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is easy to build a clay structure, but the work of transformation is exceedingly slow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be transformed into the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Remember, God is in the appearance of jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, we are pieces of clay; hence, we must be transformed into pieces of jasper and then built up to a height of one hundred forty-four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>23 THE MEASUREMENT OF THE WALL</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The twenty-third point is that the measurement of the wall is "according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel" Rev 21:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This signifies that it is in the situation of man being like an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Luke 20:35-36 reveals that it is in resurrection that man will be the same as the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the building of the wall is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In summary, we have seen several features of the wall: a It has the appearance and likeness of God, b it is a separating factor, c it affords protection, d it is built exceedingly high, e its stones are material which has been transformed, and f it is something in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Oh, this city is so rich in all points!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It reveals all the aspects of the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no other portion in the Scriptures which is so rich concerning the church life.</S>
