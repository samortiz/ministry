<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Paraphrasing a Short Portion<br>of the Scriptures</H2><P>In our practice we also need to learn to paraphrase a short portion of the Scriptures. For instance, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In this sentence there are three independent clauses. In order to make these three clauses into a prophecy, we should first pray-read: "Lord, in the beginning. Amen. In the beginning was the Word. Oh, the Word! How wonderful! The Word, the Word. The Word was in the beginning." This is pray-reading. This is also a good paraphrasing. In our pray-reading we can expound the Word a little: "And the Word was with God. Thank You, Lord, You are with God. You even were with God there in eternity past." However, in doing this we should not go too far. We should come back to the Word and pray, "Lord, You are God. The Word was God." If we desire to prophesy, we must surely practice this.</P><P>In recent years we have found a way to use a portion of the Word for morning revival. The practice of pray-reading and reading portions from The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a great help to many of the saints. Many have testified that in the past, when they came to the meeting, they did not want to prophesy, they did not want to speak for the Lord, because they had no inspiration and no subject on which to speak. But since they began to use The Holy Word for Morning Revival, their spirits have been stirred up, their thoughts have been inspired, and they now have a subject on which to speak, with some material to eat, to digest, to paraphrase, and to pray-read.</P><P>The most helpful way in reading the Bible is to paraphrase. In my writing of the training outlines on the Minor Prophets, I had to give the subject of each book, the central thought of each book, and the revelation concerning Christ in each book. I have found that the best way to receive the proper understanding of each book is to paraphrase. When I paraphrased every verse of every chapter of every book, the light came. The Word itself is light. Psalm 119:105 says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path," and verse 130 of the same psalm says, "The entrance of thy words giveth light." The best way to enter into the Word and receive the light of its shining is to paraphrase the Word. Simply to repeat the words of the Scripture again and again, using the same wording, does not help much. We need to paraphrase: "O Lord, in the beginning. Oh, the beginning. Lord, in the beginning You were the Word. Oh, the Word. You, Lord Jesus, You were the Word." This is to paraphrase. To paraphrase is to touch the "switch" and to turn the light on. When we paraphrase we "switch on" the light. This helps us to understand the Bible, to receive light, and to prophesy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By Composing Your Inspirations<br>into a Short Message for Your Speaking<br>in the Practice of Prophesying</H2><P>We also need to practice by composing our inspirations into a short message for our speaking in the practice of prophesying. If we will pray-read a portion of the Word and paraphrase it, we will surely receive inspiration. When I wrote the training outlines by paraphrasing the Word, new light came to me at a rapid pace. To pray-read and to paraphrase the Word are the best ways to receive inspiration.</P><P>In the Old Testament the practice of meditating on the Word is mentioned a number of times (Josh. 1:8; Psa. 1:2; 119:15, 23, 48, 78, 97, 99, 148), but in the New Testament there is no reference to meditating on the Scriptures in the Old Testament way. The Old Testament saints did not have the indwelling Spirit; thus, they had to meditate on the written Word. But today we not only have the Bible in our hands outwardly, but we also have the indwelling Spirit within us. When we pray-read the Word, we exercise our spirit, and the indwelling Spirit is stirred up by our pray-reading. The same thing takes place when we paraphrase the Word. In contrast, if we sit down to meditate on the Word, in not too long we may become sleepy. To meditate "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God" is altogether an exercising of the mind. But when we say, "In the beginning. Oh Lord, in the beginning was the Word. Amen. The Word. Hallelujah, the Word!" this stirs up our spirit. Then the indwelling Spirit leaps within us, and the inspirations come.</P><P>It is good always to keep a small notebook in which to write the inspirations we receive. We should write something immediately after receiving an inspiration, even writing only one crucial word to use as a reminder when we do not have time to write more. After that, for our practicing of prophesying, it is good to compose a prophecy of no longer than three minutes from the inspirations we have received. If our prophecy is longer than three minutes, we can shorten it. If it is too short, we can insert something. We can even work together with other saints to practice and to learn.</P><P>When Mary, the mother of the Lord, came to see Elizabeth, her relative, both of them prophesied (Luke 1:39-55). Mary's prophecy was a composition of short quotations from the Old Testament. This proves that Mary was very familiar with the history, the wording, and the points in the Old Testament. Her speaking did not result from an instant "inspiration" but issued from an accumulation of the word that had been stored in her being. If we have such an accumulation of the word, while we are speaking, all that we have stored within us can come up within our being to meet our need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. By Praying the Message You Write<br>for Prophesying</H2><P>We also need to practice by praying the messages we write for prophesying. After we write a message for prophesying, we need to pray-read our writing. By doing this, it will become constituted into our being. Then, we should go to the meeting and prophesy. I have the assurance that such a prophesying will be very good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. By Seeking the Infilling<br>and the Outpouring of the Spirit</H2><P>Finally, we all need to seek the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit upon us as power from on high to be our impact (Acts 6:10; 7:55; 4:31). For this we must pray. Even while we are in the meetings, on the one hand we are listening to others, and on the other hand we should pray to get ourselves filled with the Spirit and to have the outpouring of the Spirit upon us to be our power and authority.</P><P>In this message I have passed on to you the way that I have learned. I hope that in your homes you all can practice at least once a week according to these few points. If you will do this, I believe that your speaking will be even better than mine. Then we will see that all the riches stored in the saints will come out.</P>
