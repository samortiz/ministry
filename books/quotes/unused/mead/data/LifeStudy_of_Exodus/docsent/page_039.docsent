   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BRING GOD S CHOSEN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>INTO THE WILDERNESS BY THREE DAYS JOURNEY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Another aspect of God s calling is to bring His chosen people into the wilderness by a journey of three days 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Elsewhere in the Bible the term wilderness is not a positive term.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in 3:18 it is used in a positive sense, for here the wilderness is opposed to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the place of separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as one is saved, he should be brought out of the world into the wilderness where there is no Egyptian element.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the children of Israel entered into the wilderness, they were set free from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same principle, if we would get out of the world, we must get into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, not many Christians have been brought into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that some have been saved, but have not been delivered from the world and separated from it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a young man who was altogether in the world, I was full of ambition regarding my future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when I was saved, I was saved not only from the lake of fire, but also saved from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the day I was saved, all the worldly elements fell away from me, and I was brought into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to pray that the Lord will grant us the ability to bring His children out of the world and into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 3:18, Moses and the elders of Israel were to say to the king of Egypt, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Bible three days signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A complete and perfect salvation must involve a three days journey, that is, a journey in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our preaching of the gospel, there must be the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, our gospel preaching today is short of impact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People can listen to our preaching and even repent and receive the Lord, but still remain in their tombs in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to have the power of resurrection in our preaching so that others are raised out of their tombs and brought into the wilderness by a journey of three days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a journey is signified by baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every believer in Christ must be baptized to bear witness to the fact that he is leaving the world and is entering into another realm in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must pray that our ministry of the Word will have impact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not want to give mere knowledge to people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we desire that something in our preaching will touch their hearts and cause them to leave the world and journey into the wilderness in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TO BRING GOD S CHOSEN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TO THE MOUNTAIN TO SERVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AND TO SACRIFICE TO HIM</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 3:12 the Lord told Moses, When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that the purpose of God s calling is also to bring His chosen people to the mountain, where they may serve Him and sacrifice to Him 3:18; 19:1-2, 11; 24:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians have never entered into the wilderness, much less come to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are truly saved, because they believe in the Lord Jesus and they have been washed in His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, they are still in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Others have come out of Egypt into the wilderness, but they have not come to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The divine revelation concerning God s purpose was given to Moses on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The law was given to Moses there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was also on the mountain that he received the revelation concerning the design of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although most of the children of Israel did not actually ascend to the top of the mountain, they were nonetheless camped close to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moses, Aaron, and more than seventy others went up to the mountain to meet with God 24:1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The mountain in 3:12 refers to an elevation in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only do we need to be separated from the world, but in this realm of separation we need to ascend to an elevated place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only when we are on such a high level can we receive the revelation regarding God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although certain preachers may be eloquent and knowledgeable, their preaching has no impact on us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After listening to their messages, we are still in the same realm and atmosphere as before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only difference is that we have acquired some new information.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the preaching of a called one is different.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After hearing such a one preach God s word, we cannot remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His speaking delivers us from Egypt; it rescues us from the usurping hand of Satan and from the tyranny of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, it brings us into the wilderness and even to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here on the mountain, where the sky is clear Exo 24:10 , we see the vision of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we come to know what is on God s heart, and we see what God desires to have on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We realize that He desires to have a people who walk according to His statutes and who build Him a tabernacle that He may dwell among them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>TO BUILD A TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The purpose of God s calling is also to build a tabernacle to be God s dwelling place on earth 25:8-9, 40 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The vision and the building of the tabernacle occupy nearly half of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moses received the vision on the mountain, and there the tabernacle was built.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This was for the further journey of the children of Israel toward the final goal, which was to enter the good land and to build the temple there.</S>
