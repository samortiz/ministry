   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Jerusalem, as Christ s bride, comes out of Christ, her Husband, to become His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, to be Adam s counterpart Gen 2:21-24 .</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In eternity Christ with God will be such a temple as God s habitation and our dwelling place as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 21 says that the New Jerusalem will be God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that in the new heaven and new earth, the temple of God will be enlarged into a city.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Jerusalem in eternity, Christ with God is the temple for us to dwell in and also for God to dwell among His redeemed so that God in Christ can continually dispense Himself into all His redeemed and enable them to enjoy the all-inclusive Triune God forever.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. Being the Lamp of the Holy City</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Jerusalem Christ is also the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 21:23 says, The city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is light 1 John 1:5 ; Christ the Lamb as the lamp will shine with the Triune God as the light to dispense Himself into His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God as light needs a lamp.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With the redeeming Christ as the lamp, the divine light does not kill us but instead illumines us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Timothy 6:16 says that God dwells in unapproachable light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Christ, though, God becomes approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the divine light shines through the Redeemer, it has become lovable and touchable, and it has even become the light in which we can walk 1 John 1:7 .</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation 21:24 says, The nations will walk by its light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the New Jerusalem the Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light, and the nations will walk by this light, that is, by its leading.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the millennium the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold Isa 30:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the new heaven and new earth Christ will shine with God as light, and this shining will be brighter than that of either the sun or the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the nations will not need to walk in the sunlight, for they will walk in the light of Christ s shining.</S>
