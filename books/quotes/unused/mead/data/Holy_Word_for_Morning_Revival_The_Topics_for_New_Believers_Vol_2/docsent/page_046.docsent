   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9 ...Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Gal 4:26 But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Tabernacle of God</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>286 As God s habitation, the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle Exo 25:8-9; Lev 26:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That type was first fulfilled in Christ as God s tabernacle among men John 1:14 and will eventually be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This tabernacle will also be the eternal dwelling place of God s redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God will overshadow us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>See note 15 3 in Rev 7.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual habitation for both God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>287</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tabernacle in the type of the Old Testament was not only the dwelling place of God, but also the dwelling place of all His serving priests....According to typology the tabernacle was a precursor of the temple which brought in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John did not see the temple, but God and the Lamb were the temple 21:22 , which indicates that God and the Lamb became the dwelling place of His serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word matches Psalm 90:1, which says, O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the tabernacle is God s dwelling place with His serving ones, and this very God who dwells in the tabernacle is the temple which is the dwelling place of His serving ones....Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is our temple and we are His tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>288</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 21:2 and 9 clearly tell us that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife of the Lamb, 289 indicating that she is not a material city but a corporate person .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In both the Old and New Testaments, God likens His chosen people to a spouse for His satisfaction in love Isa 54:6; Jer 3:1; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>290 ...</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whereas the bride is mainly for the wedding day, the wife is for the entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years as one day 2 Pet 3:8 and then the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The bride in the millennium will include only the overcoming saints See notes 7 4 7 in Rev 2 , but the wife in the new heaven and new earth will include all the redeemed and regenerated sons of God Rev 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>291 Thus, the Bible concludes and consummates with a divine couple living a married life in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>292</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Jerusalem Above, the Mother of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Galatians 4:26 Paul tells us that the Jerusalem above is our mother...which will eventually be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth Rev 21:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>293 In Galatians 4:21-31 there are two women, Hagar and Sarah; two Jerusalems, one earthly and the other heavenly; two covenants, one of the law and the other of promise; and two sons, one according to the flesh and the other according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostle wanted the Galatians to know that they were children of the Jerusalem above, children of the free woman, and he wanted them to appropriate the covenant of promise and, according to the Spirit, enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit as the blessing of the gospel 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this section Sarah, the free woman, symbolizes the covenant of promise, which is symbolized also by the Jerusalem above, who is our mother; the mother symbolizes grace, by which we are born to be the children of God, who is the very source of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the free woman, the covenant of promise, the Jerusalem above, and the mother all refer to God s grace, which is the very means of our spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>294</S>
