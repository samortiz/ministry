   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE CORPORATE LIFE AS SEEN IN THE GARDEN Scripture Reading: S. S. 4:6-16; 5:1 FROM A COMPANY OF HORSES TO A CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seeking one in the Song of Songs is likened by the Lord at the beginning to a company of horses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord said to her, "I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots" 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was a company of horses, but in Pharaoh's chariots.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible, Pharaoh is related not only to the world, but also to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Pharaoh was a type of the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the Lord appraised the seeking one, yet He was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His appraisal of her, something was related to the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicated that the Lord was saying, "My love, you do love Me, yet you are still carrying something of the world; you are still related to the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I must liken you to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in chapter six there is much maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seemed that she was completely matured in chapter four, and this was true to a certain degree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She was indeed matured, but not as matured as she is in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter six the Lord likens her to a city with the name of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners" 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She is no longer linked with Pharaoh, but with Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She is no longer related to the prince of this world, but to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She is not a company of horses any more, but a city, and a city with the unique name of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the name of a city found both in the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a name given by God which will remain for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know of some people today who do not believe the Bible was inspired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But do you believe King Solomon by himself could compose poetry which is so fitting for today's church life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Undoubtedly, the Lord Himself inspired this book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This short book has never been so open and understandable to the Lord's people as it is to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are clear that this book describes the love between the Lord and His loved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we consider all of the figures used to describe the seeking one, we marvel: from the horses to the garden, and eventually to the city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And this city is an army.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To the Lord she is comely and beautiful, but to the enemy she is terrible and terrifying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Positively, she is the city to fulfill God's purpose to express Himself, and negatively, she is the army to fulfill His purpose to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The city expresses God in His comeliness and beauty, and the army deals with God's adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May this not simply be a kind of teaching or saying among us!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must all enter into the experience of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need the revelation, the reality, and the real experiences!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How could this seeking one grow so much until she becomes a garden to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must see how the garden comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Though we may say we have seen it, we still need to see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TWO ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first part of this book shows the first aspect of the Christian life; the last part shows the last aspect of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most Christians only care for the first aspect, which is mainly individual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Very few care for the last aspect, the corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen the Christian life in an individual way in the foregoing eight figures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were the horses, the doves' eyes, the lily, the dove, the pillars of smoke, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown all mainly a portrait describing the individual Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If most of us could attain the transformation of a palanquin or a crown to the Lord, we would consider that to be the consummation of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How wonderful it would be if we could be a transformed palanquin for the Lord's move!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To become a crown for the Lord's glory and boast that would be wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even the Lord Jesus did not mention any shortcomings in her.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The end of chapter three shows the appraisal of others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some asked, "Who is this one?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The others answered, "This is Solomon's couch and Solomon's palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is even Solomon with the crown."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then chapter four gives the Lord's appraisal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In both appraisals no shortcomings are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She has been perfected in her Christian life.</S>
