   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET TO BEING PERFECTED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE A PILLAR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me now tell you the secret to being solidly perfected to be a strong pillar for the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Certain brothers have been perfected because they have had no concepts of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Recently, one brother declared strongly that he only knows to follow the ministry of Brother Lee and to absorb everything of this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There have been others among us who were quite opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They often said, "Brother Lee says such-and-such.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is this right?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is the church right?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just a week ago, I learned about a mistake made by the church."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>None of these opinionated ones has yet been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But those who haven been perfected to be pillars are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when they see certain mistakes, they forget about them, having no time to waste discussing them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They only desire to soak in all the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FEASTING ON THE POSITIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to God's principle in His creation, in order for anything to grow there is the need for a negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Take the example of a chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all appreciate chicken eggs, breasts, and legs, but we certainly do not care for chicken dung, feathers, and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, without dung, feathers, and bones, a chicken cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for a chicken to be a chicken, it must have these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But it is not our portion to eat them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should enjoy the eggs, the breasts, and the legs, and forget the dung, the feathers, and the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we concentrate on the positive aspects of the chicken, we shall receive much nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I admit that the church in Los Angeles has made certain mistakes, and I confess that I have made mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The elders can testify of this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everybody makes mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have had to make mistakes in order to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These mistakes are my "dung."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you eat this, you are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I also admit that I have "feathers."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church in Los Angeles also has had a certain amount of "feathers" and "bones."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, without these "feathers," "bones," and "dung," neither the church in Los Angeles nor my ministry would be able to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you intend to gather up the "feathers" and say, "Look!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Look!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what Brother Lee has done.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>See all these awful 'feathers.'"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do this, you will not damage the church in Los Angeles or my ministry, but you will surely damage yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To do this is not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These who have been perfected to be pillars, who surely are not less intelligent than you, are wise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Their eyes are much clearer than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But they refuse to devote their attention to the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They would say, "Although Brother Lee has some 'dung,' he has a great many eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I don't care for the 'dung' issuing out of his ministry I want to eat all the 'eggs,' 'breasts,' and 'legs.'</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have no time to hear about 'feathers' and 'bones.'"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us follow the example of such brothers to forget the negative things and to feast upon the "eggs," "breasts," and "legs."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is my burden in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are you in Anaheim as a spy, investigating whether or not Witness Lee has any "dung"?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I cannot live without "dung."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be sure, both "feathers" and "bones" can be found here in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elders have made many "bones."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I would stand, even dance, upon all the "bones" they have made; I would not be so foolish as to eat them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Three or four of us knew Brother Nee very intimately.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He fully opened himself to us, and we knew his imperfections.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we realized that these imperfections were the "dung" that enabled him to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Unlike others, we would not cling to his "feathers," nor to the "bones" of the "chicken" in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we had done this, we would have sacrificed ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I never suffered such self-inflicted damage.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, I enjoyed the fresh, nourishing "eggs," "breasts," and "legs" of Brother Nee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a great turmoil was aroused against his ministry, I was not ashamed to say that I was an absolute follower of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I did not care what others said about his mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I only knew how grateful I was to him for the perfection he had rendered to me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I knew the nourishment I had received from him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even when we are in the New Jerusalem, I shall be able to say that the Lord used Brother Nee to perfect me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Apart from his ministry, I would never be the person I am today.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How foolish it would be for anyone in the church to devote his time to finding "dung" or stuffing his pockets with "feathers," saying, "This is a 'feather' from that 'chicken' Witness Lee, and these are the 'bones' of the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Don't you know that the church in Anaheim has made mistakes?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If this is your intention, you are wasting your time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are in the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Neither Witness Lee nor the church in Anaheim would pay you for exposing them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But do not think that we are afraid of being exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whatever Witness Lee is, he is what he is.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether the church is genuine or not, the church is what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Neither the church in Anaheim nor my ministry is afraid of exposure.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the contrary, we appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But what will you gain by exposing us?</S>
