<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class="title">TESTIMONIES BY THE SAINTS<br />AND WORDS OF EXHORTATION</h1><h2 class="head4">(Church Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: May 8, 1948, evening<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>(Editor's Note: Testimonies were given by all the brothers and sisters who had handed over themselves. At the end of the meeting, Watchman Nee gave a word of exhortation.)</p><p>For over twenty years God has been taking the way of recovery among us. This way is becoming clearer and clearer. Today everyone who holds back anything for himself is either a sad person or a weeping person. Within the last few days, I have met some of the happiest people I have ever seen. Many people held my hands tightly, and they were both excited and happy. Praise God, there are many happy faces here today. They have all handed themselves wholeheartedly to the Lord. Tonight it is as if the last train is about to leave. I hope that no one will miss this train and that no one will be left behind.</p>
