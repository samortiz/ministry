   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Nee also said that it would be hard for us to change since we were accustomed to this traditional way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we changed suddenly, it might result in a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, he proposed a brothers' meeting for the brothers and a sisters' meeting for the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these meetings he said that there should not be any assigned speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He made it clear that all of the saints should speak in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These meetings, however, did not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, we were not able to practice the truth which Brother Nee saw in 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As our history progressed in the Lord's recovery, some situation of our meetings has gradually drifted back more to the same as that of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though we had renounced the traditional and unscriptural way of Christianity, we still carried with us some of Christianity's practice of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christianity is still prevailing among us as long as we continue the practice of having church meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the church life, the way of meeting is vital.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How the church goes on depends upon how we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we still meet according to the traditional way of Christianity, how can we say we have given up Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are still continuing in this unscriptural practice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This traditional practice, the practice of the clergy and laity, results in hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have said that we hate, despise, and condemn the clergy-laity system, but what has been the real situation among us in the past years?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to admit that unconsciously the clergy-laity system has crept in among us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spontaneously, hierarchy has also begun to exist among us, and the clergy-laity system has been increasing unintentionally among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In nearly every locality, there has been one big speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not much attention or regard was given to all the saints functioning in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the meetings of the church, everyone expected to have a good speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1984 I felt strongly that I should go back to Taiwan to have a new start for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was clear that we needed a new start, and the way to have a new start among us was to change the system of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The new start had to be revolutionary in the sense of overthrowing the unscriptural and traditional way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I saw clearly that if we could overthrow this way of meeting, hierarchy would have no place among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must overthrow the way of meeting with a big congregation, and with one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This annuls the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The proper way of meeting is a way that is full of mutuality.</S>
