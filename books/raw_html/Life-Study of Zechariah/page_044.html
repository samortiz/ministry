<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah as Jesus Shepherding<br>the Afflicted of the Flock of Israel</H2><P>In verses 7 through 11 and 14, we see Jehovah as Jesus shepherding the afflicted of the flock of Israel. Verse 7a says, "I fed the flock of slaughter, and thereby the afflicted of the flock." The I here refers to Jehovah, as indicated by the previous verse. Jehovah as Jesus came to feed His people, who were about to be slaughtered, the afflicted of the flock.</P><P>Verses 7b through 11 say, "And I took to myself two staffs; one I called Favor, and the other I called Bonds; and I fed the flock. Then I destroyed the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also detested me. Then I said, I will not feed you. What is to die will die, and what is to be destroyed will be destroyed, and those who are left will each eat one another's flesh. And I took my staff, Favor, and I broke it in pieces so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. And it was broken in that day; and thus the afflicted of the flock, who watched me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah." Here we see that Jehovah as Jesus brought two staffs&#151;Favor and Bonds. Favor means grace, and Bonds means to be bound into oneness. Then Jehovah as Jesus set aside the three shepherds&#151;the priests, the elders, and the scribes. He destroyed them, and their souls detested Him. The Lord Jesus as the proper Shepherd was rejected, leaving the children of Israel as a flock without any shepherd (John 10:11). With respect to Israel's being without a shepherd, Matthew 9:36 says, "Seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd." Furthermore, He broke the staff, Favor (Zech. 11:10). This indicates that He broke the covenant which God made through Moses, leaving the people without a covenant to cover them. He thus took away the grace (Favor).</P><P>Verse 14 goes on to say, "Then I broke my second staff, Bonds, in pieces, so as to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel." This indicates that the binding love was also taken away. As a result, the nation was divided and full of inner fighting (v. 9). From the day of Christ's crucifixion, there has not been any oneness among the Jews. Although those in the northern kingdom, Israel, and the southern kingdom, Judah, were brothers, the brotherhood among them has been broken because the binding love has been broken. This took place as they were living under the oppression of the Roman Empire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Messiah, as the Proper Shepherd of Israel,<br>Being Detested, Attacked, Rejected, and Sold<br>for Thirty Pieces of Silver</H2><P>Zechariah 11:12 and 13 reveal that the Messiah, as the proper Shepherd of Israel, was detested, attacked, rejected, and sold for thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave (Exo. 21:32). What is prophesied here was fulfilled in the Gospels. The Lord Jesus was sold under the reign of the Roman Empire, and He was judged by the Roman rulers.</P><P>Zechariah 11:12 and 13 say, "I said to them, If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, do not bother. So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver. And Jehovah said to me, Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price that I am priced with by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter, into the house of Jehovah." This clearly indicates that Christ was detested, attacked, rejected, and sold. In order to understand these verses and know who provided the silver and who threw it into the house of Jehovah, we need to study the four Gospels.</P>
