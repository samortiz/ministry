   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 4 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt 5:17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>22 But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment .And whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rom 8:4 That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the Old Testament economy, God's dealings with His people were based upon the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in the New Testament economy, God deals with His people today according to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The principle of the law has been abolished, but the commandments of the law have not been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Never think that there is no need to honor our parents or to refrain from stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No, instead of being abolished, the commandments of the law have been uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although our contact with God is not based upon the principle of the law, we must still observe the uplifted commandments of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At this point the Seventh Day Adventists might say, "Yes, we must keep all the commandments of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One of these commandments is to keep the Sabbath ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the commandments of God have not been abolished, one of these commandments, the law about keeping the Sabbath, is not related to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, it is a ritual law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A ritual is a form, a shadow, that we need no longer observe today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, we do not need to offer animal sacrifices, do we?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Likewise, we no longer need to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today is an age of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our sacrifice is not a lamb or a goat; it is Christ, the reality of all the Old Testament sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In like manner, our rest is not a particular day; it also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Christ, the reality, is here, all the shadows are over.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of the ten commandments have been repeated and uplifted in the New Testament except the fourth commandment, the commandment to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This commandment is over because it is not related to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus spoke about murder and adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Murder refers to our temper, and adultery, to our lust.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to live up to a moral standard higher than that of the old law, you must overcome your temper and your lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why you need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why you need another life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must contact Him not only day by day, but even hour by hour.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to remain in constant fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The crucial point of the Lord's decree concerning the law is that we must have a standard of morality much higher than the standard of the old law after we have been saved by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's warning in Matthew 5 must force us to stay with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must have a daily life full of fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to say, "I must stay close to the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I must be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I even lose my temper with my brother, I may be burned in the fire v. 22 ." This thought of being burned by fire is found in both 1 Corinthians 3 and Hebrews 6.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How awful it would be to pass through such a burning!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, in Revelation 2:11 the Lord said, "He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word implies that the defeated Christians will be hurt by the second death, the lake of fire Rev 20:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans 8:4 says that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not trying to keep the law, for the more we try to keep it, the more we break it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Within the spirit, there is the King, Christ, who is our resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we walk according to the spirit, we fulfill even the requirements of the highest law.</S>
