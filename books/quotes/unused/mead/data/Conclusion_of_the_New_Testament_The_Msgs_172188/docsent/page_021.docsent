   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 62</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider further aspects of the believers' standard of morality and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4 Practicing the Surpassing Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus says, "Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The surpassing righteousness is the condition of entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By keeping the highest law to the highest standard we fulfill the condition for entering into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 5:20 righteousness does not refer to the objective righteousness, which is the Christ we receive when we believe in Him that we may be justified before God 1 Cor 1:30; Rom 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It refers to the subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This subjective righteousness is not obtained merely by fulfilling the old law, but by completing the old law through the fulfillment of the new law for the kingdom of the heavens, the law given by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5:17-48.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This righteousness of the believers according to the new law of the kingdom surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees according to the old law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by the divine life, the resurrection life of Christ. a Not Getting Angry Surpassing Not Murdering</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 5:21 and 22 the Lord Jesus says, "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever shall say, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "brother" in verse 22 proves that the Lord's word here is spoken to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The most difficult thing for us to do is to control our anger, our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is also very difficult for us not to condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 22 the Lord speaks about saying to our brother, "Raca" or "Moreh."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word Raca is an expression of contempt, meaning stupid, good-for-nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreh, that is, fool, is a Hebrew expression of condemnation indicating a rebel Num 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This expression is more serious than the expression of contempt, Raca.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How difficult it is neither to condemn a brother nor to hold him in contempt!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we should have no confidence in our natural life but enjoy Christ's overcoming life through the divine dispensing.</S>
