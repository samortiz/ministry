<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING CHRIST TO BE OUR ALL</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Christ...became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; According to the grammatical construction of the original text, wisdom is the sum total of righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; these three items added together equal wisdom. Humanly speaking, we do things according to wisdom. Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are God&rsquo;s way of doing things because they issue out of God&rsquo;s wisdom, which is Christ. God has made Christ wisdom to us as the way for our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption so that Christ may become everything to us.</p>
<p>God has made Christ our righteousness so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). With regard to righteousness, the emphasis is on our justification and salvation in the past. Our justification is not merely because of what Christ has done; Christ is our justification. Christ is our righteousness so that we may be justified and acceptable to God.</p>
<p>God has made Christ our sanctification to be our sanctifying life, power, and living. With regard to sanctification, the emphasis is on our sanctification and victory in the present. Everything in a sanctified life, including faith, love, meekness, humility, patience, temperance, goodness, and godliness, is Christ Himself. Christ is our sanctification so that we may live a sanctified life and walk on a sanctified path. When we live out sanctification, we live out Christ.</p>
<p>God has made Christ our redemption so that our whole being, especially our body, may be delivered from the corruption of the old creation and may enter into the glory of the new creation by the power of His life. With regard to redemption, the emphasis is the redemption, the rapture, and the transfiguration of our body in the future. Hence, Christ is also the redemption of our body. Christ will not merely redeem our body; He will be our redemption.</p>
<p>Christ is the righteousness that God has given to us for our past, the sanctification that we are experiencing in our present, and the redemption in our future. When we obtain and experience righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, we gain and experience Christ. Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are God&rsquo;s way, His wisdom, so that we may fully partake of Christ as our everything. This is the central purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. This is His intention in creation, and this is the highest attainment of His redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD REVEALING CHRIST IN US</h2>
<p>God makes Christ everything to us by revealing Christ in us through the Spirit (Gal. 1:16). God does not give Christ to us, the believers, in a bodily form so that we can to see and touch Him only in an outward way. Rather, Christ became the Spirit so that He could be known and received in our human spirit. The Spirit reveals Christ to us and makes Christ real to us in our spirit. Christ enters into us and grows in us through the revelation of the Spirit. Daily the Spirit reveals the fullness of the Godhead and the riches of His life so that we may know, experience, and gain Christ in a deeper way until He is formed in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN US</h2>
<p>The greatest and highest blessing that we have obtained in God&rsquo;s salvation is Christ being in us. When we believed into Christ, He immediately entered into us (cf. 2 Cor. 13:5). This is explicitly confirmed in God&rsquo;s Word, and this is also proved and confirmed by our experience. After receiving Christ, some believers sense that Christ is in them as comfort and satisfaction. Some new believers sense that Christ is regulating them and forbidding them to sin, and others sense that Christ is enabling them to overcome enticements and temptations that they previously could not overcome and to endure sufferings and trials that others cannot bear. Some new believers also sense that Christ is leading and instructing them to walk on the proper path. Those who belong to Christ can sense His presence within them, especially when they are lonely, sick, or in danger.</p>
<p>Some people might say that the believers&rsquo; sense of Christ being within them is only psychological, not a reality. However, we should ask whether idol worshippers ever imagine that an idol is within them? Do those who revere the sages ever imagine that one of the sages is in them? Idols and sages cannot enter into us, because they are not living. Hence, men do not imagine or perceive that an idol or a sage is within them. However, Christ is the living God, and He can enter into us as the Spirit. Hence, we can sense His peaceful, joyful, bright, powerful, divine, and glorious presence. This is not our imagination or a psychological effect. This is a spiritual reality, which is as real as electricity in an electric appliance.</p>
<p>Christ is living in us. Even though our nature is corrupt, our flesh is filthy, our living is a failure, and our conscience is under condemnation, it is a divine fact that Christ is in us. Can we say that Christ is not in us? Second Corinthians 13:5 says, &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; Because we are in the faith and approved, we have Christ in us.</p>
