   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CO-WORKERS AND THE ELDERS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:5; 5:17; 3:2; 1 Pet 5:1-2; Acts 14:23a; Titus 1:5; Acts 13:1-3 THE ELDERS Taking Care of the Church and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Bearing Responsibility for</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Administration of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The primary responsibility of the elders is to take care of the church and bear responsibility for the administration of the church 1 Tim 3:5; 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The administration of the church is the elders responsibility, whereas the co-workers in the church simply work in coordination with the elders to build up the church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The co-workers should not touch anything related to administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they do, they go beyond their duties and infringe on others authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This can be likened to the priests and prophets in the Old Testament who helped the elders but did not replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later, they also helped the kings but did not replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to know that the elders are the administrators among God s people and that the co-workers should not interfere with the administrative matters of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Teaching and Shepherding God s People</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The elders should not only bear responsibility for the administration of the church, but they also need to teach and shepherd God s people 3:2; 5:17; 1 Pet 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the matter of teaching and shepherding, although the elders may not be weak, sometimes they are not able to meet all the needs related to shepherding and teaching; hence, there is a need for the co-workers to release the word and help with teaching and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The co-workers should be given the opportunity to do as much as they are able in spiritual matters, such as teaching and shepherding, and the elders should give them the opportunity to fully develop their function so that the serving ones can learn to function as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Bearing the Responsibility for</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>and Serving in Only One Locality</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders of a local church should bear the responsibility for and serve in only one locality Acts 14:23a; Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They should never interfere with nearby churches that are smaller; it is dangerous to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, because the church in Taipei is a large church, the nearby churches can be easily influenced by it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to worldly experience, cities with fewer people usually follow and learn from cities with more people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is rarely the other way around.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This should not be the case in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the basis of the church in Taipei is wrong, the leading of the church will also be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this case the churches that follow the church in Taipei will also be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Due to this danger, the elders of the church in Taipei should stay within the boundaries of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Taipei is their sphere, their realm; they should never extend beyond their boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CO-WORKERS Laboring in Spiritual Matters</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>in Coordination with the Elders</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Build Up the Church, the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The co-workers labor in spiritual matters in coordination with the elders in order to build up the church; this is a clear principle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, the elders should never be self-content, thinking that because they are elders, they have no need of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, while co-workers are laboring in various places, they may see that an elder is not so capable or may be lacking in experience and insight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if this is the case, it is wrong for co-workers to go beyond their duties and labor in place of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At times, the co-workers may feel that they cannot do much spiritually because the elders do not fellowship with them; this concept is also incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the elders are responsible for the administration of the church, they do not necessarily need to fellowship with the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if this is the case, the co-workers still need to bear spiritual responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 4:11 speaks of a number of gifted ones, such as apostles, prophets, and evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders in some localities may not be good at preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may be able to take the brothers and sisters to knock on doors, but they may not be able to perfect them in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, there are some co-workers among us who are good at the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Especially in a big church such as Taipei, there is a need for some to work specifically in the gospel to lead and perfect the brothers and sisters in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When these ones lead the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, they do not need to fellowship with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if they need to use the meeting hall for a gathering, they must fellowship with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the co-workers decide to use the meeting hall at the same time that the elders have planned to have a meeting, this will cause conflict, and the administration of the church will not be carried out smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>College students like to listen to seminars, and as a result, many seminars are conducted on college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to attract young people, some may suggest that the ones serving on the college campus should host a seminar on human life and the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Surely such a seminar would help some understand the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if the serving ones take this suggestion, decide to have the seminar at the meeting hall without fellowship, and announce it excitedly, this is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In serving the Lord in the church we must maintain the principle that although it is all right for the serving ones to host a meeting or gospel seminar at the meeting hall, they should not touch the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since the meeting hall is under the administration of the elders, they should first fellowship with the elders before using the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, the serving ones at a college campus may decide to use the hall for a gospel seminar at a time that conflicts with an event previously decided upon by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This lack of coordination causes conflicts and problems.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not likely that such a thing will happen in small churches, but it often happens in larger churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This example demonstrates the principle of how the elders and co-workers should coordinate in the church.</S>
