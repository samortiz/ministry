   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN PRIESTLY MINISTRY Scripture Reading: Exo 19:1-6; 1 Pet 2:5-9; Rev 1:6; 22:3-4; Phil 4:18; Rom 12:1; Heb 2:10; 4:16; 5:1; 6:19; 7:18-25; 8:1, 3; 9:7-8, 24; 10:19-22; 12:22; 13:14-15; Acts 13:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Genesis we see God's creation of man for the realization of His purpose and man's failure regarding that purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we see God moving to recover what was lost in man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we see Him seeking an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After securing this individual, we see Him seeking and securing a family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the discipline of His people and the realization of His purpose, God took that family into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He took a household into Egypt, but He brought a nation out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why did God go to such effort over such a prolonged period a period of about 2000 years to secure this people?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He Himself made His purpose known: "I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself...ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests" Exo 19:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's purpose in redeeming His people is to obtain priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was why He said to Pharaoh, "Let my people go that they may serve me."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God chose Abel, and Abel brought an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He chose Noah, and Noah built an altar and offered offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then God called out a whole nation for Himself, and He clearly made known to them His purpose in their redemption: that they might be "a kingdom of priests."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of a breakdown on their part, only a section of the people ultimately became priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, it was God's original purpose that the whole nation should be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's thought for Israel and for the church is one a universal priesthood!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What God could not secure in Israel He is going to secure in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of Hebrews is specially devoted to the subject of the priesthood; it reveals that the primary matter in relation to the priesthood is entering into the presence of God 4:16; 6:19; 7:19, 25; 8:1; 9:7-8, 24; 10:19-22; 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We find few commands in the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Its greatest command is to enter into God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The all-inclusive ministry of the children of God is to enter into the presence of God and never go out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God brought Israel out of bondage and bade them enter into the land which He had set before them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He also has brought us out so that He might bring us in. The sum total of God's purpose is to bring us into His own presence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Opening the way was costly because it had to be opened by the shed blood of the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now our ministry is in the Holy of Holies within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every child of God is called to be a priest, and every priest exists for the specific purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices Heb 5:1; 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is there then no work in which the children of God can engage?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yes, for if priests offer "gifts and sacrifices," it is obvious that they require things to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to obtain these things, they must work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The trouble with many Christians is that their work is an end in itself; it is just work as work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The vital matter is not whether we are engaged in this or that work, but whether or not our work is on the ground of our priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of the children of Israel who came out of Egypt were shepherds, but that was not their calling; they were called to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of them were craftsmen, but that was not their calling; they were called to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person might want to offer a sheep because he was a shepherd or offer his handicraft because he was a craftsman, but God cannot accept offerings on this ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He can accept them only on the ground of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The question is not what work we are doing, but whether or not we are doing the work as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Old Testament days the prophets were esteemed above the priests, but God's thought was not to have a kingdom of prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He wanted a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as in the days of the Old Testament, the prophetic ministry is valued far above the priestly ministry in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God's purpose for His people is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He wants a universal, not a limited, priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Acts 13:1-2 speaks of the "prophets and teachers" that "were ministering to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These men were prophets and teachers, but their prophecy and teaching were "unto the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was based on the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are not priests, we will never be prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our priestly ministry determines the quality of all our other ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The value of all the work we do is estimated by the priestly element in it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's original purpose for all the Israelites was that they would pass by way of the altar into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Priestly ministry is the basis of all ministry to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no ministry to Him apart from the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was the altar that distinguished Abel from Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Abel had an altar that was stained by blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Noah's history we see the altar again, as well as in Abraham's history.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wherever we find a man chosen of God, we will inevitably find an altar to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While God was dealing with individuals, the altar was used only occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, after He secured a people for Himself, the altar ceased to be intermittent and became permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Abraham built more than one altar; so did Isaac and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But when Israel was constituted a people, the tabernacle was set up and the altar was permanently established there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sacrifices were no longer at intervals but continuous; the altar was no longer a personal matter but a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God's thought in building the church is to have a place for the exercise of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Ephesians 2 we are told that He is building up His saints into a holy temple so that He might have a habitation for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is from God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1 Peter 2:5 we see that from man's side a spiritual house is being built so that spiritual sacrifices might be offered by a holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The book of Hebrews shows us an eternal priesthood, and the expression of that eternal priesthood is a perpetual altar with perpetual sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The existence of the church is for priestly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If this is lacking, the foundation of the church is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God wants a perpetual priestly ministry, expressed by a perpetual altar and perpetual sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The altar must never be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God's demand is that the fire on the altar should never go out.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church does not exist merely for service or even for warfare, but for the offering of sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church's calling is to priestly ministry, and the object of priestly ministry is to offer sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the church fails in this, she fails in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>First Peter 2:5 does not say that the church is "built up as a spiritual house to offer up spiritual sacrifices," but that the church is "being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The priesthood offers the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The church is not just a place where sacrifices are offered, but a place where the priesthood is established.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not a matter of the offering of many isolated offerings but the institution of a permanent priestly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the Old Testament days an ordinary Israelite could easily count the occasions on which he presented sacrifices at the altar; but a priest could never count the number of the offerings he offered.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It was not an occasional occurrence for him; it was a ceaseless matter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His offering could not be recounted as isolated acts; it constituted his whole ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He lived for this and for nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>His life consisted in the offering of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God's expectation of His people is not just for occasional or even frequent sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>His priesthood is a perpetual priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Many Christians have a definite date on their calendar that marks their consecration; some have several dates when they offered themselves in a special way to God as the result of revival meetings, etc. But this is far from God's thought for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is not looking for separate, sacrificial acts, but for a life that is a perpetual sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The vocation of the church is the priesthood, and since the vocation of the church is the priesthood, the work of the church consists in the offering up of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the all-inclusive ministry of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are priests, then our only occupation in life is to offer gifts and sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But it is a "holy priesthood" that offers up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is no satisfaction in the heart of God when His people offer up sacrifices if they in themselves are not a priestly people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are not primarily called to be workers; we are primarily called to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Work provides much that builds man up, interests him, and satisfies the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But priestly ministry is an altogether different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It contributes nothing to man; rather, it takes everything from him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we finish a piece of work, there often follows a sense of success that ministers satisfaction to the flesh, but we reap no satisfaction for ourselves when we offer sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are just left with empty hands.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we have offered an offering to God, it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God accepts no work that is not a sacrifice, that is not wholly offered up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The question is not: "What have I done?"</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Rather, the question is: "Has what I have done been done as an offering to God?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Has it passed out of my hands into His?"</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If what we have done has not passed over to the other side, it is not priestly ministry and it is outside the realm of the church's vocation.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If what we have done has not passed over to the other side, then we have not passed over to the other side either, because the offerer goes with the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If our offering ascends to God, we will ascend with it.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When we retire to bed at night, we should not ask, "How much have I done today?"</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Rather, we should ask, "Of what I have done, how much has been a spiritual sacrifice?"</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>How often can we look up to the Lord at the end of the day and say, "Lord, may I put this into Your hands?"</S>
