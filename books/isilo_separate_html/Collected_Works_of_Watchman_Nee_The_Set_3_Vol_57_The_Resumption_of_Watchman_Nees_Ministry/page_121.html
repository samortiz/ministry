We have to see that we are all priests before God (1 Pet. 2:5). Both Exodus 19 and Romans 12 tell us that everyone is a servant before God. At the same time we see that service is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter. This is the reason we ask all the brothers and sisters to hand over themselves. Actually, there should be no need to speak about this matter. As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he is a priest. Originally, many things could be said directly after a person believed. However, due to the captivity of the church into Babylon, degradation came in, and there was the need for a recovery. Today the church is indeed the community of saved ones, but it is not yet the community of serving ones. If God's children do not serve, the church will merely become a "club house'' of saved ones, a place where saved ones come together to sing, preach, and meet. This is to change the basic nature of the church.</p><p>Because the church has become fallen, all the brothers and sisters have become free to do whatever they like and to express whatever opinion they have. As a result, many things have become optional, and some have become lawful. On the one hand, no one likes to meddle with others' affairs. On the other hand, we do not like others to meddle with our affairs. For this reason some barriers develop among God's children. But God's Word says that the church is the place where men serve God. It is the place where God's children work and labor together in one accord. The church as seen from God's Word is very different from the church of today. In God's Word every person, matter, and event are for serving God.</p><p>In the future we have to bring everyone up to this standard. Many people who have become Christians do not know what it means to serve God. In the future we will not have to tell the saved ones to hand over themselves; by that time, they will not be able to be a Christian if they do not hand themselves over the first day. If a man does not forsake everything, he will not be able to step into the door. Those who do not forsake everything to follow the Lord cannot be His disciples (Matt. 10:37-38). Outwardly speaking, it seems difficult for a man to forsake everything. But inwardly speaking, this is something that brings us joy. A man must be brought to a point where he is willing to give up everything. Only then will he be able to follow a straight course. Today, when we ask you to consecrate, we have to persuade you to do it. But in the future we will not need to persuade anyone. A man will either drop the world completely, or he will not be able to be baptized at all. Either you come in an absolute way or you do not come. Some people have said that the term "handing over'' is wrong. We are not arguing about terminology today. You can call it whatever you like. What matters is the reality. In the past men thought that serving God was a matter of personal choice. They thought that being zealous or not was one's own business, and that serving or not was also one's own business. But now this is changed around. If there is the coordination and you are in trouble, other brothers and sisters beside you will not let you fall. In this way the church interferes with as well as supports every individual. Many people will be watching over you as well as helping you and protecting you.</p><h2 class="head2">Everything Done in the Fellowship of the Church<br />and for the Benefit of the Gospel</h2><p>The brothers and sisters should know that their future, their jobs, occupations, dwellings, businesses, possessions, and everything that forms a part of their living should be put in the fellowship of the church. Formerly, one could make decisions on his own. But now, if he is to take the service of God as his center, everyone has to take one great step forward. From now on no one can make his own decisions or do things his own way. Many enterprises and occupations do not render much help to the gospel. The responsible brothers will ask you to change these occupations. What we do must be of maximum benefit to the gospel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_120.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_122.html">Next</a> </body></html>
