   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD USING CHRISTIANS TO ATTRACT MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO ASPIRE AFTER HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people often say that they are not hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are not hungry because there is no drawing power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Song of Songs says, "Draw me, and we will run after thee" 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How does the Lord draw men today?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He draws men through other men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He works through us to draw men to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are an experienced person and have received answers to prayers, God will use you to attract others to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way to attract others is to create a desire in them to seek after what we ourselves are seeking after.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every time I have gained some spiritual experience, I have gained it because others have gained it already and I longed after it, not because I suddenly discovered something in my reading of the Word or in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others have experienced the overcoming life, and I desire the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Others have received the outpouring of the Spirit, and I desire the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I receive my experience of the overcoming life and the outpouring of the Spirit through others' experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When others draw me, I run after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today very few people have the power to attract others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we, as workers of the Lord, do not have the power to attract others and if we can only give others teachings, we will not be of much use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Men may admire us and like us, but we have to ask if they have the desire for the life that we have before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is possible for many people to admire us today, but the question is whether or not we can draw them to God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today God renders help to men through Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may hear that So-and-so in Tientsin or So-and-so in Chefoo had a certain experience, and we may desire to have the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will create a hunger in us, and this hunger will induce us to seek after the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>COUNTING ALL THINGS AS REFUSE AND</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PRESSING TOWARDS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What are the outward marks of a man who is seeking?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can find some characteristics of a seeker from Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul said that he had given up all things and counted them as refuse for the sake of gaining Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He told us that he had a mark set before him, and that he was forgetting the things which were behind and pursuing towards the goal that was set before him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I like the few words: "suffered the loss," "count them as refuse," and "pursue."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we want to pursue, we have to settle many things; we have to suffer the loss of all things and count them as refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Refuse is trash.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Have you ever emptied out your trash?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My New Testament may cost very little, yet I do not want to let go of it because I treasure it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, it is easy for me to let go of the trash.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One is not heartbroken when he throws out his trash.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, he is glad to get rid of it as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we put money into the offering box, we count it carefully before dropping it into the box.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do this because we treasure the money very much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The things of this world may be nothing but old rags to us, but to a trash collector, an old rag may mean quite a bit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is trash to us, but it may be a valuable possession to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God tells us that the things of this world are but an old rag.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, many people consider the things of this world as their enjoyment, right, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we see Christ, we will see that the things and objects of this world are nothing but trash.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I doubt how many of us truly know what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may consider many things in your daily life to be good and right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if you know what sin is, you will realize that these seemingly good and right things are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many husbands never consider that they have wronged their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many children never consider that they have wronged their parents, and many people have never thought that they were the ones who were wrong in their family.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you carefully consider, you will realize that many of your relationships are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are not conscientious, you will not deal with these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But unless you deal with these problems, they will not go away, and it will be difficult for you to make any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to gain anything spiritually, you have to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are willing to pay the price, seek the Lord in everything, and be conscientious to deal with the problems, you will experience a genuine revival.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if you hold back, keep many things in your hand, and do not let go of them, you will not gain the Lord and nothing much will happen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, if you have too much money in your hands, you should dispose of it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Old Testament, the books of the law were lost after the temple was defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the books were found again, the people read them and the priests went to the temple and cleansed it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the temple was cleansed of all its defilements cf.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>2 Kings 22:8 23:25 , God's glory filled the house once more.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May we be willing to deal with all the defilements and uncleanness so that we can be filled with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How great, how rich, and how full are the provisions that God has prepared for us in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many people only know the Lord as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They do not know how much more the Lord can be to them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We pray too little.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What God can give is far more than what we can ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is there anyone here who is willing to open his mouth wide to receive the riches of the Lord today?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His riches are unsearchable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it" Psa 81:10 .</S>
