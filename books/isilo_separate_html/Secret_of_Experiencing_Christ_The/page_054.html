Here Paul speaks of philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world. In 2:23 he refers to asceticism when he speaks of "self-imposed worship and humility and severe treatment of the body." According to 2:8, philosophy is involved with tradition and the elements of the world. Self-imposed ascetic practices have much to do with tradition.</P><P>Every group of people has its own particular elements of the world, or elementary teachings. Wherever the gospel is preached, those who proclaim the gospel will confront elementary teachings, certain traditions, and philosophies. Both modern, scientific countries and undeveloped countries have their own elementary teachings, elements of the world.</P><P>Philosophy, tradition, asceticism, and the various elements of the world are the negative things found in the book of Colossians. I do not have the assurance that the saints in the Lord's recovery have been thoroughly and absolutely rescued from the elements of the world and from the "commandments and teachings of men" (Col. 2:22).</P><P>As one born in China, I studied the classical writings of Confucius and was influenced somewhat by his philosophical teachings. But now I can testify before the Lord and before all the angels that I am no longer under the influence of any philosophical things. This influence has been swallowed up by the Bible. I have been reading the Word for more than fifty years. As a result, in my inner being there is no influence of any kind of philosophy. The only influence on my inward constituent is the Bible. This is the reason that I am able to enjoy Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORD OF CHRIST</H2><P>In 3:16 Paul says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly." The way to be delivered from the negative things found in the book of Colossians is to let the word of Christ dwell in us, to inhabit us, richly. If the word of Christ is to dwell in us richly, it is not sufficient for us to read the Bible only on occasion or even three or four times a week. On the contrary, we need to take the word of the Bible as our daily food, our daily manna. In fact, just as we eat three meals a day, it is best to feed on the Word three times a day. Then the ingredients of the Word will enter into us and be constituted into our very being.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
