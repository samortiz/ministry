   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Need of the Lord s Healing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am concerned about the situation of today s believers, including our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of us may still be spiritually blind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may need to pray, O Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I need You to heal my blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, I want to receive my sight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mark 4:12 indicates that we may see and not perceive and hear and not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since this may be our condition, we need to pray that the Lord will have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also need to empty ourselves in order to see the spiritual reality of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Pharisees thought that they saw a great deal, and they regarded themselves as somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, they were nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were even more empty than the tax collectors were.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, although the disciples followed the Lord Jesus from the beginning of His ministry and saw the things that took place in His ministry, they continued to be blind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have pointed out, we also may be spiritually blind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of us have been in the Lord for years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Subconsciously we may think that we know a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But actually we still may be blind, not seeing the things that we need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we need the Lord s healing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the presence of the Lord, we need to have the deep conviction that we are nobody, that we know nothing, and that we need Him to give us sight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our reading of the Gospel of Luke, we may wonder why the case of the healing of a blind man near Jericho is recorded so far along in the narrative.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may think that such a case belongs much earlier in the book, perhaps in the section that records the Lord s ministry in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, in chapter eighteen, when the Lord is very close to Jerusalem, we have the account of the healing of this blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This case indicates that the followers of the Man-Savior need Him to heal their blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SAVING ZACCHEUS IN JERICHO</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 19:1-10 we have the record of the Lord s saving Zaccheus in Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 1 says, And He entered and was passing through Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that Jericho is a city of curse Josh 6:26; 1 Kings 16:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 19:2 says, And behold, there was a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector and he was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Tax collectors were those who collected the taxes levied by the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nearly all of them abused their office by demanding more than they should by false accusation Luke 3:12-13; 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To pay taxes to the Romans was very bitter to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those engaged in collecting them were despised by the people and counted unworthy of any respect Luke 18:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Often they defrauded the people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, they were classed with sinners Matt 9:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Luke 19:3-6, in order to see the Lord Jesus, Zaccheus, who was small in stature, climbed up in a sycamore tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord came to that place, He looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house v. 5 . Zaccheus came down and welcomed the Lord, rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But those who saw this grumbled, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 19:8 Zaccheus said, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we see that once a sinner receives the Savior, the issue of this dynamic salvation is his dealing with material possessions and the clearance of his past sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Greek word for taken anything in verse 8 is the same as that used in 3:14.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a mild way of speaking of extortion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The tax collectors used to put a higher value on property or income, or increase the tax of those unable to pay, and then charge usury.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Zaccheus told the Lord that if he took anything by false accusations, he restored four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was according to the law s requirements for restoration Exo 22:1; 2 Sam 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Luke 19:9 the Lord Jesus went on to say to Zaccheus, Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However evil this tax collector was, he was nonetheless also a son of Abraham, a chosen heir of God s promised inheritance Gal 3:7, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 10 the Lord says, For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that the Savior s coming to Jericho was not accidental but purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He came to Jericho purposefully to seek this unique lost sinner, just as He sought the sinful woman in Samaria John 4:4 .</S>
