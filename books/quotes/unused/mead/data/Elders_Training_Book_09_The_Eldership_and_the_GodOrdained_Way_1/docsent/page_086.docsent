   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is revealed in the New Testament concerning the preaching of the gospel is not shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All those who preach the gospel must do so as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These priests bring God to people and bring people back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They offer these people to God as spiritual sacrifices, as parts of the enlarged, corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is what Romans 15:16 reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Peter 2:5 and 9 show that Peter had the same thought as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter said here that we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house, and this built up spiritual house is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The priesthood in these verses refers not to the priestly service but to the priestly body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a group of priests built together to be a "hood," a body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This priesthood tells out the virtues of the One who called them out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To preach the gospel is to tell out God's virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By His virtues we have been called out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was our enjoyment of God Himself as our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some of His virtues are love, kindness, and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through God's virtues we were saved in a subjective way, being brought out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To tell out these virtues is to bring God to people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we merely tell people that we are bringing God to them, they may not realize what we are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why we must live a life of telling out God's love and mercy to us and of telling out His forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we go to people to bring such a God in all His virtues to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we go to preach the gospel to people, we must exercise our priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are priests handling God's gospel, which includes everything from the incarnation of the Triune God to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must serve God as priests by handling the entire gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As priests of the gospel of God, we should first get sinners regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then as nursing mothers we should nourish and cherish these new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to nourish and cherish them with the word in the Spirit, ministering life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to nourish them with the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By doing this we help them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we can bring them into group meetings so that they can be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This fellowship should show us that whatever is revealed in the New Testament concerning how to serve is altogether different from our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord's recovery began among us, we gathered from Brother Nee all the studies he had accumulated from church history concerning the New Testament way of Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We practiced what we saw from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then because of the Lord's mercy, we gradually found out that what we were practicing was not so complete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We had many deficiencies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Nee started to restudy the Bible beginning in 1931 for the purpose of seeing more concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In recent years, especially in the last four and a half years, I have also studied the Word concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today I believe that we are here with the result of all our study.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have studied the New Testament book by book, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot find any more verses concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have nearly exhausted the study of the New Testament concerning the scriptural way of Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are wise and would receive the Lord's mercy, we will see that this is what the Lord wants to do today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This move of the Lord is like a tide.</S>
