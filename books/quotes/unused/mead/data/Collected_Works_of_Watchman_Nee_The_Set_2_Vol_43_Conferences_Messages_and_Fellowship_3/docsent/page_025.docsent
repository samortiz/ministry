   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOOD BEING FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REMOVAL OF MAN'S SIN BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tonight let us first consider the blood and resurrection, that is, the substituting death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we study the substituting death and resurrection, let us first understand our relationship with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We already know that sins are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Chinese language, the word gu means "guilt."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I sin, I am guilty before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have committed sins, and because I have sinned, I am a guilty man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How should God deal with this?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for God to forgive sins, He must first judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When sins are judged, they can be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, if I commit a crime on the street and a policeman arrests me and brings me before a judge, the judge will not let me walk away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I must either pay the penalty or be imprisoned before he will let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have sinned, and God cannot let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He must judge the sins according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if God judged us, we could not bear it because we could not satisfy God's righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because God loves us, however, He paid the debt that we should have paid.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Originally, man had to pay the debt, but God paid the debt instead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, redemption is God taking our place in suffering judgment and in the payment of debts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Redemption is the result of God's love, and it is accomplished by the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the purpose of the blood of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The blood has nothing to do with man; it accomplishes redemption before God and satisfies God's righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BLOOD CLEANSING THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>RATHER THAN THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians have a wrong concept that the blood of the Lord is for cleansing the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The blood is referred to over four hundred times in the Old and New Testaments, yet the Bible never once says that the blood is for cleansing the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is strange that Christians would say this when the Bible never speaks of this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One brother asked, "Doesn't Hebrews 9:14 speak of the blood of Christ cleansing our hearts?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the original text this verse does not say anything about cleansing the heart; it only speaks of cleansing the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible the blood of Christ is for cleansing our conscience, not for cleansing our heart, because our heart embodies the self, the real I. The real I came from Adam and is by nature unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It can never be cleansed no matter how much it is washed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible calls this heart the stony heart Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>11:19; 36:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The stony heart cannot become a heart of flesh no matter how much it is washed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What can we do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God says that the stony heart must be replaced with a heart of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, regeneration does not mean cleansing the old man, but doing away with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One can never wash a statue of mud.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we wash it, the dirtier it will become.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same is true with respect to our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why the Bible never speaks of the blood cleansing the heart; it only says that the blood cleanses the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The conscience gives us a feeling of peace or unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The heart is man's self, his real I. What does it mean for the Lord's blood to cleanse the conscience? It means that the blood has taken away our sins before God and that the punishment we deserved before God has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of His blood, our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we believe in the Lord, we are assured that our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's blood has taken away our sins before God, and our conscience is at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Initially, the conscience found fault; the very thought of our sins and the coming judgment took away any peace in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But as soon as we realize that the Lord's blood has accomplished a vicarious redemption for us, our conscience is at peace immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the Lord's blood washes away the guilt in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is how the conscience is at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the conscience is cleansed, it no longer has consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is something entirely objective; it is a matter before God and has nothing to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man does not need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The blood is something required by God; it is the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Exodus 12:13 says that when God sees the blood, He will pass over us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not man who sees the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is God who sees the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, please remember that the blood has nothing to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The blood is for bearing the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If sin is not removed, God's purpose cannot be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Man has sinned and unless God comes in to save, the sins cannot be passed over.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The blood is altogether objective; it is on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The only thing man cares about is peace in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The blood takes away man's record of sin; it removes man's sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The work of the cross deals with the negative things on man's side.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, whenever the Bible speaks of the blood, it refers to something on the Lord's side.</S>
