   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Wrong Concepts</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the gospel preaching, there are some wrong concepts that I must point out to you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In some of the denominational churches there is much activity in the outreach of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is good, but the problem is that there is too much human effort and struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is wrong, but this does not mean that we should retire from fruit-bearing and not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not be old in bearing fruit; we should always be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no retirement in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another kind of concept in Christianity is that we must wait and pray for a great revival then the Lord will send a giant speaker, and we will come together to have a gospel campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a third concept at the other extreme which is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some say, "Look at those people!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All their gospel campaigns are just in the energy of the flesh!''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, we must realize that all our gospel preaching must be the overflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But those who criticize in this way have been criticizing others for years, yet they themselves have not brought in any new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seems that there is no overflow of life with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So they have gone to the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. The Normal Way</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the normal way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The normal way is not to use our human effort; nor is it to depend upon a revival campaign with a giant preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fruit-bearing is the outflow of life; so we must grow in life and also take the responsibility of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church should encourage every member to pray for the bringing in of new converts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should spend at least two or three hours weekly to take care of some new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not right for a church to remain the same in number year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose that after five years we still have the same number.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we do not have the exercise of the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What do I mean by the flow of life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I mean that we must abide in the Lord and enjoy the riches of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we must be burdened for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must pray, "Lord, my daily life is to bear fruit.''</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the Lord will give us a deep realization for two or three persons for whom we should care.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may know 50 persons, but at that time the Lord will burden us with only two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will pray for them, mentioning their names to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we need to seek the Lord's guidance regarding how to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps we will invite them to dinner along with some of the brothers and sisters; then there will be others to help in ministering life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The brothers and sisters in the church should help one another in a mutual way in the matter of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not do this just once in a while, but constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should spend at least two or three hours weekly in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not expect a quick job.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is by doing it steadily and constantly that we will see the results.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If every year each one would bring in one new convert, within a year's time the church would be doubled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And after another year, it would be doubled again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The young people should bring in one new one every six months.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not too much to bring in one new convert in one hundred and eighty days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In fact, it is too little.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If each one could bring in two a year, by the end of the year, the church would be doubled twice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may say that this is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose then that each one brings in one every two years, or that two brothers bring in one each year.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In six years, the church will have doubled three times.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And you cannot say that it is too much for each one to bring in one every two years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What an increase there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must not trust in the big gospel campaigns, we must trust in the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The increase of the church is the fruit-bearing, not a great campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a branch we must bear fruit, and one fruit every two years is so easy.</S>
