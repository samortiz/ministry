<p>The hungry people were by the seaside (6:22-25). They wanted to eat bread and be filled; hence, they sought the Lord Jesus (v. 26). They sought the Lord Jesus on one side of the sea and on the other side of the sea. They were by the seaside. This account has symbolic meaning. In the Bible the sea is the dwelling place of demons and symbolizes the world corrupted by Satan, the world filled with sin. The seaside is adjacent to the sea and signifies the place where people live a sinful life. The seaside is adjacent to the dwelling place of demons. People do not live in the sea with the demons, but they walk by the seaside, which is very close to the dwelling place of demons. People do not live the life of demons; people are not demons, but they live a life that is very close to the demons. They are by the seaside; they are close to demons. People in the world live a sinful life by the &ldquo;seaside.&rdquo; Thoughtful people acknowledge that humanity is full of sins. This sinful humanity is the seaside. It is full of corruption and sin and very close to the demons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DISSATISFIED</h2>
<p>This portion of the Scriptures reveals that the people who walked around the seaside were inwardly dissatisfied. Nothing in their sinful life could satisfy them, and nothing enabled them to live forever. They had a genuine need, the need for eternal life. On the one hand, they lived a sinful life. On the other hand, they were dissatisfied with their human life. These people lived in sin, they lived a sinful life, but they did not sense that they were sinful. They only felt dissatisfied with their human life. Therefore, on the one hand, they sought the Lord, but on the other hand, they lived a sinful life.</p>
<p>This is still the situation today. On the one hand, people live a sinful life, and on the other hand, they are dissatisfied with their human life. On the one hand, they sin, but on the other hand, they are seeking. Human existence consists of committing sins, being hungry, and seeking. Besides committing sins and being dissatisfied and seeking, there is nothing else for people in the world to do. If we observe humanity, we will discover that everything related to humanity involves these two things. Every product on the market is either related to sin and entertainment or related to meeting people&rsquo;s needs. Hence, people are either sinning or seeking. People are seeking because they feel dissatisfied and sense an inward need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORKING NOT FOR THE FOOD THAT PERISHES</h2>
<p>The hungry people sought the Lord Jesus because they hoped to receive physical food from Him to satisfy their hunger. However, the Lord Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Work not for the food which perishes&rdquo; (v. 27). The word <em>perish</em> is quite emphatic. The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You people see only what is present. You see the tangible instead of the intangible and the earthly instead of the heavenly. You care for the body instead of the soul and the spirit, and you care for the temporal instead of the eternal. You seek physical things instead of spiritual things. Everything that you seek will perish. Every physical thing in this world will perish. Hence, do not seek physical food, and do not work for the food that perishes.</p>
<p>Food is for man&rsquo;s satisfaction. In principle, therefore, food is whatever man seeks to be filled with or whatever man seeks to satisfy his need. If someone seeks money, money is his food. If he seeks education, education is his food. If he seeks a good family and a career, his family and career are his food. If he seeks clothing and beautification, clothing and beautification become his food. Whatever man seeks in order to be satisfied is his food. From the perspective of the Lord Jesus, however, this food will perish. A very expensive garment will eventually deteriorate, even if it is not worn. The most delicious food will gradually rot if left untouched. Nothing related to fame, wealth, and position lasts forever.</p>
<p>In northern China people say that one rarely finds a household whose wealth lasts more than three generations. There is no sure way to keep wealth from one generation to the next generation. Wealth continually changes hands in human society. Other things, such as education and position, also cannot be maintained. They are temporary attainments. Everything related to human life is temporary; it will soon disappear. All things perish.</p>
<p>Regrettably, people are willing to be deceived by the things that perish. Although these things perish and cannot last forever, people seek them and refuse to wake up and repent. People are continually deceived by physical things. Many people declare that physical things are practical and that physical things can be realized, but physical things cannot last even if they are practical. Physical things vanish and disappear after a short period of time.</p>
<p>Some people say that material riches also undergo chemical changes. Material riches do not need to be spent. In time they will undergo chemical changes and disappear. Those who rely on material riches for satisfaction must realize that material riches will disappear even if they are not spent.</p>
<p>Everything will disappear. A good son will eventually pass away. A good family may collapse for no reason. A good relationship between a husband and wife may dissolve one day for no apparent reason. All these things are food that perishes; they are deceptions. Even if a person gains all these things, he will still be empty because these things cannot satisfy him. Man does not lack these things; they are not man&rsquo;s genuine need.</p>
<p>People know that they have a need, but they do not know what they need. Because they have the wrong concept that physical things can satisfy their needs, they do their best to gain physical things. This is like the hungry people who sought the Lord but did not know their true need. These people thought that they needed physical bread, but their true need was the bread of eternal life. For this reason, the Lord Jesus told them, &ldquo;Work not for the food which perishes.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Changing Death into Life &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
