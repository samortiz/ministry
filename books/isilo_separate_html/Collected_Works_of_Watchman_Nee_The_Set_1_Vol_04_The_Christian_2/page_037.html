How tender is He! How gracious are His acts! The Lord knows how to honor their good works. How these ones had worked, labored, and endured among others had not escaped the Lord's attention. The Lord also saw how they had hated sins and had tried the false apostles. The Lord also noted how they had saved others in labor, how they had worked with endurance, and how they were untiring in their good works. These merits were commended by the Lord. He knows how to pay attention to one's good works. How loveable is our Lord! Our Lord truly loves to speak well of the merits of His people. It is unfortunate that we do not have that many merits for Him to praise! Just as the apostle told the believers: "What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things" (Phil. 4:8), in the same way the Lord loves to praise what is good in His sight.</P><P>"I know." How these two words pierce our hearts, yet how comforting they are! All the work and condition of His people are under His searching, for He is walking in the midst of the golden lampstands. Hence, we must never hide our sins, for "there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account" (Heb. 4:13).</P><P>"I know your works." The Lord knows everything already. This is why He can judge. It is only after the Lord has accepted a person that He will accept his work. Those who are not saved, no matter how good their works are, can never satisfy the Lord to the extent that He would grant them salvation. Those who have entered the church must be those who have been saved. A man must first be received by the Lord before his works can be accepted by Him. These ones have works. How excellent this is! How much work do we have before the Lord that can be called work at all? These ones not only have mere faith; they have works as well.</P><P>"Labor." How much the Lord commended Ephesus! Not only did they have the works, they also had the labors. To labor means to struggle to work and to strive to do something. Who has labored for the Lord in toil? Are we not counting our lives as precious? How many are there who are putting everything aside for the Lord's work? When we consider the coldness in the present age towards God's work, we cannot help but join in with the Lord to praise the labor of the Ephesians.</P><P>"Endurance." Their works, labor, and endurance refer mostly to their virtues in the church. The most important virtue in the congregation of the saints is endurance. If all the saints lived by themselves, they might not need that much endurance, but when people gather together, even if it is only two or three, endurance becomes indispensable. There are foolish ones. There are loose ones, backsliding ones, talkative ones, and rash ones. In a church, there are hundreds of opportunities for us to endure, but this is not an easy thing to do. These ones have endurance. No wonder the Lord commended them. Even the proof of Paul's apostleship was also endurance! Moreover, endurance here has the meaning of persevering. Many people, like the Galatians, are good at the beginning. Yet when difficulties come, they drift along with others and lose their faith. It is truly God's own work to enable one to endure. Man's strength soon vanishes. Only God can endure to the end. Furthermore, what is needed the most in trials is endurance, but the thing that goes away the fastest in trials is endurance. Among these ones there were the evil ones and the false apostles (v. 2). Outwardly there were the persecutions (v. 3). Their trials were indeed numerous, yet they could endure. This is surely commendable!</P><P>In particular, it often happens that in enduring, one subconsciously allows sinful things to come in, thus enduring sins as well. At least, it is easy to become forgiving towards the evil ones. How dangerous this is! There are few people around us who are perfect. Once we touch the evil ones, our spiritual sense can easily become dull. The conduct of the worldly people is not ours to judge. However, if there are brothers who have sinned, we have to excommunicate them. "Remove the evil man from among yourselves" (1 Cor. 5). This is the teaching of the Bible. Unfortunately, our endurance and love seem to exceed God's ordinance. God charges us to take forth the precious from the vile (Jer. 15:19). Yet we tolerate the vile, thinking that in it there are precious things also! We have acted contrary to the Scripture in being forbearing, loving, and enduring! The Lord commended the Ephesians, for they were not only enduring but would not "bear evil men." They had preserved their corporate purity. Even when there were those who called themselves as highly as apostles, they were still not afraid of them. This is indeed not easy!</P><P>"You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false" (2:2). These false apostles are the ones Paul described in 2 Corinthians 11: "For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ" (v. 13). Before Paul left Ephesus, he had warned others concerning them: "I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them" (Acts 20:29-30).</P><P>After reading these verses, we realize that both the Lord as well as His church consider the apostleship the most important ministry in the church. Paul himself had testified to the church in Corinth that his apostolic ministry was received from the Lord. His setting up churches everywhere, his personal encounter with the Lord, and his miracles and wonders are all proofs of his apostleship. Please read 1 Corinthians 9:2 and 2 Corinthians 11 and 12. Because this ministry is so important, there were lawless ones who came in as imposters. These false apostles were there even before the apostles passed away. After they died, these false ones became even more numerous. However, the church did not receive them at the beginning. During the second half of the first century there were many such false apostles. At present, other than the Roman Catholic Church who still claims its pope to be the successor of the apostles, most Christian churches have conceded that the apostolic ministry no longer exists. The Pentecostal Church has apostles, but they, like the pope, are recognized by no one. When we see the cessation of the apostolic ministry, we readily realize that the Lord has suspended all forms of organization in the church.</P><P>"And you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary." This verse speaks of their work in the world. The Lord had mentioned their endurance before. Why was He mentioning it again? The endurance that was mentioned before was endurance in the church. Here, it was their endurance in the world. They were not only expressing the Lord's virtues in the church but were suffering for the Lord in the world: "And have borne because of My name." They saw that so many in the world were not yet saved and that the Lord had died for them. They sympathized with the Lord's heart for all men to be saved and strove to labor for the Lord's saving name. "And there is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). These ones were truly working and saving men for the sake of the Lord. Although they were faced with trials within and without, they were still tireless in their good works and did not grow weary through their suffering.</P><P>After we have seen the virtues of the Ephesians, we cannot say that everything they had was superficial and that they did not have any love for the Lord. Their virtues were approved by the Lord, and their nature was quite reliable. Paul mentioned work, labor, and endurance to the Thessalonians. He said, "Your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thes. 1:3). True work, labor, and endurance cannot be separated from faith, love, and hope. Since the Lord commended them, their virtues before the Lord must have far excelled those without any inward reality. However, they were still lacking in something.</P><P>If we stop here and the Bible did not say anything further, then we would have to say that this was indeed a perfect church. Which church today can be compared with such a church? If we consider the Word of God as our spiritual mirror, we have to conclude that the Ephesians were far better than we are. Wherever God's people are gathered together in twos and threes into His name and have become a church, they should compare themselves with this church so that they can realize their true condition. However, the most important thing is, although these virtues satisfy men, are they satisfactory to the Lord? Christ did not have much for which to rebuke them concerning their work and their doctrine. Their zeal, their defense of the truth, and their separation from sins were blameless, but these are not enough for the Lord to be satisfied. Although the Lord praised them for many things, He said further:</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
