   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Self-righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we use the term self-righteousness, we do not mean self-justice.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Someone who is self-righteous always considers that he is right.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We use self-righteousness in the sense of someone thinking he is never wrong, but always right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>F. Self-justification</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Self-justification is another characteristic of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>G. Self-vindication</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The desire to convince others that we are right, to vindicate ourselves, is also of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>H. Self-exaltation</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Self-exaltation is another characteristic of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we can see that self-confidence, self-righteousness, self-justification, self-vindication, and self-exaltation are all aspects of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not forget that this is a lesson concerning service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must help the saints to realize that in the church service, we have to condemn self-confidence, self-righteousness, self-justification, self-vindication, and self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There should be nothing of the self in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we have these aspects of the self, we are absolutely fleshly, and the Spirit, the holy anointing oil, has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are so self-confident, self-righteous, self-justifying, self-vindicating, and self-exalting, we lose the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is gone in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I. Being Opinionated</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being opinionated is different from having an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may have an opinion and not be opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An opinion is a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everybody has opinions, but we should not be opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be opinionated is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The friction and the dissension among us come from our being opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These things belonging to the flesh are the roots of the problems in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>J. Murmurings</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Philippians 2:14 charges us to do all things without murmurings, which are of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Murmurings are of our emotion and come mainly from the sisters.</S>
