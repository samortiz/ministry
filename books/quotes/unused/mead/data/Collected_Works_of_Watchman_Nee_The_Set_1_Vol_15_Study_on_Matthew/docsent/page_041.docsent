   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What mattered to the Lord was whether or not He was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 1-8 the Lord spoke on the doctrine; in verses 9-13 the Lord did a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord did not mean to say that the disciples could violate the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, He meant that the Sabbath was spoiled by the sin of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What God wants is the Sabbath in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the spiritual reality exists, then the outward appearance of spirituality can be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Speaking against the Spirit because of ignorance is not considered blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Speaking against the Spirit knowingly and deliberately is considered blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 12:37 is different from Romans 10:10.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The former refers to being justified before God, whereas the latter refers to being put in a new position before men, that is, to being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 38-42 form the fifth subsection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the "thens" in Matthew are different in time from those in Mark, at least by a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew recorded the events according to chronological order, with the stress on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 38:"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible mentions the following three kinds of miraculous things: 1 miracles merely pointing to God's acts, 2 wonders wonderful things, and 3 signs miracles that have some significance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 39: "But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The length of time the adultery continues determines the duration of this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we should take note of the following three words, which are renderings of three different words in Greek: 1 world, referring to the organized world on earth; 2 age, referring to time; and 3 generation, referring to man's entire lifetime, in the narrow sense, and to a generation, in the broad sense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Evil" refers to the nature; "adulterous" refers to the communication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did the Lord specifically mention the prophet Jonah?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should keep in mind that in this chapter the Lord still took care of the line of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jonah was sent not to the Israelites but to the Ninevites.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Corporately, the children of Israel were given up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because they blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, the Israelites no longer had prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Individually, they were placed in the position of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, at Pentecost three thousand, and later five thousand, were saved Acts 2:41; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 41:"Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Formerly the Ninevites repented after hearing what Jonah preached.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today's Jonah first passed through Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Formerly, Jonah was thrown into the sea because of his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the Jews cast "Jonah" into the sea; they reject the Lord of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 42:"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The queen of the south was also a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today's Abyssinia name changed to Ethiopia after World War II Editor's note is the country of Sheba, which still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jonah as a prophet went to Nineveh; the queen of the south came to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The One who is more than Jonah goes to the Gentiles; the One who is more than Solomon attracts the Gentiles to come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Gentiles receive the Lord and are attracted to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The cross is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom 1 Cor 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the cross is not only a sign but also wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, it is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The case of Jonah is a sign, and that of Solomon is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verses 43 through 45 form the sixth subsection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 43:"When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Waterless" may also be rendered "dry."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The demon possessed people were the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This conclusion is based on the last part of verse 45, which says, "Thus shall it be also with this evil generation."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only human bodies can make the demons feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the unclean spirit goes everywhere to seek rest, that is, to seek men whom he can possess.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Concerning the unclean spirits, or the demons, there are two ways to look at this verse:</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, we consider it from the teaching in 1 Corinthians: demons and idols are the same 1 Cor 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because of their worship of idols, the children of Israel were carried away captive to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later they cast away the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After their return, there was the sect of the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the beginning Paul also belonged to this sect.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a religious sect, they were very strict; nonetheless, they were still empty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, they were still in their former state.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Lord came, they rejected Him, and their last state was worse than their first state.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Second, we consider this verse in the light of demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever the Lord sees demons, He casts them out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During the Lord's time, it seemed that the demons had gone out from men, yet men remained empty because they did not receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the coming great tribulation, the last three and a half years of this age, demon possession will be more severe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The previous section talks about the repentance of the Gentiles, whereas this section describes the condition of the unrepentant people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 44:"Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came out.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And it comes and finds it unoccupied, swept, and decorated."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The unclean spirit takes man's body as his house.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Greek word translated "decorated" implies that things were added.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Swept" is negative; it is to take things out.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"Decorated" is positive; it is to add things in. The Jews were exactly like this, yet the Lord said that they were empty.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Historically, this verse refers to idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Morally, it refers to some superficial changes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse 45:"Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and settle down there.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus shall it be also with this evil generation."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The demons prefer to dwell in the bodies of those who are morally good.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Concerning the immoral ones, the most evil ones, not only God and men have no way with them; even the demons have no way with them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a person has only some improvement in morality but does not have the Lord in him, his condition becomes worse.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>"The last state" refers to the persecution during the time of the great tribulation; this is seen in the record in Matthew 24:15-31.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some thought that the Jews considered one generation as forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, they said that the Lord's word here referred to the things that would come to pass within forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It did so happen that forty years later Jerusalem was destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, the thing referred to by the Lord already has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This seems to be quite correct.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, we know that such an explanation does not fit with the context here.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"Generation" may also be rendered "race."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is why some people say that this passage refers to a race of people.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, if it is speaking of the race of Israel, does this mean that the race of Israel will be annihilated?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Of course, this is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Therefore, "this generation" does not refer to a race in the flesh or to a definite number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Rather, it implies that this generation will last the same length of time as the evil and adulterous generation, even longer than one particular age.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Verses 46 to 50 form the seventh subsection.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Verse 46:"While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside seeking to speak to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>By reading Mark 3, we can see that the Lord's relatives came to find the Lord to lay hold of Him, for they thought He was beside Himself v. 21 . Matthew did not record this in that way; his record is different from Mark's because it was written according to the line of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Here, the Lord's relationship in the flesh with the children of Israel had already been severed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Verses 47-48:Here the Lord Jesus showed them that His relationship with the children of Israel, and with His mother as well, had been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Verse 50:"For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A brother is for rendering help, a sister is for showing sympathy, and a mother is for loving tenderly.</S>
