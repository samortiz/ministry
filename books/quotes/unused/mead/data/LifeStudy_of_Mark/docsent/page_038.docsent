   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT REMAINING IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE NATURAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BUT IN THAT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 3:31-35 we see the fifth auxiliary act for the Slave-Savior s gospel service: not remaining in the relationship of the natural life but in that of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mark 3:31 and 32 say, And His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And a crowd sat around Him, and they said to Him, Behold, your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside seeking you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the opposers blasphemy, instigated by Satan, the relatives of the Slave-Savior came again to trouble Him by their natural concern for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Undoubtedly, this also was motivated by the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to verses 33 through 35, the Lord said, Who is My mother and My brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And looking around at those sitting in a circle around Him, He says, Behold, My mother and My brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For whoever does the will of God, this is My brother and sister and mother.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord s word here indicates His rejection of His relatives natural concern.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to defeat the evil one s schemes and fulfill His gospel service, He would not remain in the relationship of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This displayed His absoluteness for God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Looking at those sitting in a circle around Him, the Lord declared, Behold, My mother and My brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He went on to say that whoever does the will of God is His brother, sister, and mother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see that the Lord s relationship with His followers is not in the flesh but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whoever does the will of His Father is His brother for helping, His sister for sympathizing, and His mother for tenderly loving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through His gospel service the Slave-Savior was making the believing sinners His spiritual relatives, those who became His many brothers Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11 in the house of God Heb 3:5 and His many members for the building up of His mystical Body Eph 5:30; 1 Cor 12:12 to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today the Roman Catholic Church considers Mary the mother of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But here the Lord Jesus denied His natural relationship with His mother and said that the one who does the will of God is His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that a sister who does God s will may have the boldness to declare that she is a mother to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, it is not presumptuous for all of us to say with boldness that we are the Lord s brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 3:31-35 we see that the Slave-Savior did not remain in the relationship of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, His relationship with His followers was of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From this auxiliary act we see that in order to be powerful in God s ministry we need to deny the natural relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The greatest entanglement to God s ministry is the natural relationship with father or mother, husband or wife, children or relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By denying the natural relationship the Lord Jesus avoided this entanglement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In these five auxiliary acts for the Slave-Savior s gospel service we see that there is no ground for the natural concept, the natural understanding, or the natural relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In these auxiliary acts everything is spiritual, holy, and divine, altogether contrary to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would follow the Lord to have these auxiliary acts today, we should not give ground to natural concepts or relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to follow the Lord in these matters, everything must be spiritual, divine, holy, and according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we shall have the standing and the boldness to carry out God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that we all, especially the young ones, will be helped and impressed by these auxiliary acts for the Lord s gospel service.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In particular, we need to be impressed never to consider the Lord s recovery, the Lord s ministry, and the Lord s move in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not measure the things of the recovery according to the natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the events recorded in the Gospel of Mark took place under the Lord s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, in 1:14-45 we have five matters that form the contents of the Slave-Savior s gospel service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in 2:1 3:6 we have five incidents that show us the ways of carrying out the gospel service.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have seen, we also have the five auxiliary acts in 3:7-35.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These five cases, five incidents, and five acts, happened according to God s sovereignty in an excellent sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we see these matters, we shall know how to carry out God s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we see the contents, the ways, and the acts, we shall know what the Lord s gospel service is, we shall know how to carry out this service, and we shall know how to have the ground, the position, for doing God s work.</S>
