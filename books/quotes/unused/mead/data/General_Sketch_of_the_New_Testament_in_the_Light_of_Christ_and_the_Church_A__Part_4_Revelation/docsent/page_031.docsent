   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE THE EVENTS FROM THE DESTRUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF BABYLON TO THE JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE GREAT WHITE THRONE Scripture Reading: Rev 18 20</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of Revelation is the New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, however, we must come to chapters eighteen through twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BABYLON THE GREAT AND HER DESTRUCTION The Material Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 18:1 says, After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Angel is Christ, for only Christ s glory can illumine the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 8:3-5 Christ as another Angel offers incense with the prayers of the saints, and in 10:1 Christ as another strong Angel comes to take possession of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now in 18:1-3 Christ as another Angel comes to judge and overthrow the political and material Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have seen, Revelation 17 is the record of the fall of the religious aspect of Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter seventeen impresses us with the fact that the great harlot, the apostate Roman Catholic Church, will be more and more prevailing until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The harlot has been riding on the beast, signifying both the Roman Empire and the Antichrist, to utilize its political power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the time of Constantine the Great who made Christianity a national religion, the Roman Church has very much utilized the political situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This union of religion and politics, which is fornication, will continue until the day Antichrist with his ten kings will turn against the Roman Church to destroy her and burn her with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That will put an end to her.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 17:17 this will be something of God s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 17 says, For God has put it into their hearts to perform His mind and to perform one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Roman Catholic Church has very much utilized the Roman Empire, but it will be of God that eventually the Roman Empire will bring the Roman Church to an end. This is something divine and sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 18, however, records the fall of Babylon, the city of Rome, mainly in its political and material aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That this is the material aspect is shown by verse 10, which speaks of the great city, and verses 11 through 13, which speak of the traffic of merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord will come back purposely to judge the material Babylon and bring it to an end.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Application of the Prophecy</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>of Babylon the Great</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>with Respect to Communism Today</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the time I was in college, the Russian Bolsheviks, the Communists, sent people to indoctrinate and poison the Chinese young people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I saw how these Communists worked among the students, and a number of my schoolmates were gained by them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is why most of the Communist leaders today are my age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The intention of the Communists is to create their own version of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1939 a young, proud Chinese man, who frequently would listen to my ministry, came to me and said, Mr. Lee, you preach the kingdom of the heavens, but we are working it out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not tell me that he was a communist, but by the terms he used I immediately recognized that he was.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The intention of the Communists is to establish a new kind of human society, regardless of the cost to human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They would even sacrifice most of the human race as long as they could gain a small number from the young generation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is their devilish goal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I came to the West in 1958, many Christian friends expressed their deep concern that the Communists would take over the Western world, including America and western Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This surprised me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I could not understand how so much of the Western world could be deceived by the false propaganda of the devilish Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1958 I was invited to London and Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While there even the most spiritual persons expressed to me the fear that all of Europe would soon fall to the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In their messages, they tried to prepare the hearts of the saints to face the same situation that the dear brothers in mainland China had faced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since I had come from China, they asked me what I felt about that.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am a small person with no famous name and no theological degree, but I boldly said, Dear friends, do not believe the lie.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those devilish people will never take over your country.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, of course, western Europe is still safe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The saints in Denmark and England wondered how I, not being a king, a prime minister, a president, or even a prophet, could predict this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I gave them the reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I told them that in the minds of the Communists, they have only two enemies today, one religious and one political and military.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their religious enemy is Roman Catholicism, and their political enemy is the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, their goal is to get rid of these two.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If they achieve this goal, they can be successful worldwide and have their kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, according to the prophecy of the divine Word in Revelation 17, Catholicism will be very prevailing until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a strong sign that Communism will never be prevailing in a worldwide way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, what we see in Revelation 18 is not Communism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, it is one hundred percent contrary to Communism.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Communism there is no commerce with selling and buying as is portrayed in verses 10 through 13, so this chapter is another strong sign that at the end of this age Communism will not be prevailing in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord will preserve the situation on the earth for His purpose.</S>
