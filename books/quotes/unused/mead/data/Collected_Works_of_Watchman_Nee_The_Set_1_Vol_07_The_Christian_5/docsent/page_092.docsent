   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ACTS 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 18:"And she did this for many days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But Paul was greatly disturbed; and turning, he said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And it came out that very hour."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the present time, God will not have the spirits preach for him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 19:"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit had gone out, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually Satan was behind all of this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although he could do nothing except leave the slave girl v. 18 , he tried to stir up a storm from another angle and cause trouble to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How diligent is Satan's working!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 25:"And about midnight Paul and Silas, while praying, sang hymns of praise to God; and the prisoners were listening to them."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To have such a voice in such a place!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No wonder the prisoners listened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 26:"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And instantly all the doors were opened and everyone's bonds were unfastened."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were not moved by the power on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why they could shake the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 34:"And he brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted because he had believed in God with all his household."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan thought that by putting them into prison, they could put them to death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Little did he know that it was God who sent them to the prison to save the jailer and his whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How often has Satan miscalculated!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can he compete with God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The jailer and his household were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no infant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"He exulted because he had believed in God with all his household."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they could exult through believing in God, none of them could have been infants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 40:"And they went out from the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they saw the brothers, they exhorted them and went forth."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They exhorted the others instead of being exhorted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ACTS 17</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 2:"And according to his custom Paul went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was not keeping the Sabbath, but merely seizing the opportunity while they were together to "reason" with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 11-12: "Now these people were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore many of them believed, and there were not a few Greek women of high standing and men."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If one reads the Bible without prejudice, surely he will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 16:"And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we lack in these days are such provoked ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 21:" Now all the Athenians and the foreigners sojourning there spent their time on nothing other than telling or hearing something new.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>" The men of Athens listened to news, while the men of Berea searched the Scriptures v. 11 . Many people have time to read the newspaper, but do not have time to read the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 JOHN 3</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 2:"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Now we are" now we are saved!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can God's children not be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 3:"And everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The "even as" in verse 3 is for now, while the "even as" in verse 2 is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should have the first "even as" now, and then we will have the second "even as" in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 5:"And you know that He was manifested that He might take away sins; and sin is not in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only He who has no sin can remove sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can sinful preachers save sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The "manifested" in verse 5 is His first coming, whereas the "manifested" in verse 2 is His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first coming removes man's sins, and the second coming delivers man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 6:"Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The verb "sin" here should be translated as "continue in sin."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 7: "Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is righteousness in our conduct, which is different from the righteousness one receives when he is justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 8:"He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord was manifested to do two things: to destroy the works of the devil, and to remove man's sins v. 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 13:"Do not marvel, brothers, if the world hates you."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are a few things which we should not marvel at: 1 the oppression of the poor Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>5:8 , 2 the regeneration of the sinner John 3:7 , 3 the power of Christ John 5:28 , and 4 saints being hated 1 John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verse 14:"We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He who does not love abides in death."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We love because this one is a brother and is begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not love only those brothers whom we love, and we should not only love those who love us, but we should "love the brothers" all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How can man's love today come up to such a standard?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 16:"In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who do not know that the Lord has died for us do not know what love is.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 17:"But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Giving is the outlet of love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To hold back from giving is to shut up this outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who shut up their affections toward their brother cannot love God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One should give simply because the other is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Any other motive will not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many charities are but an effort to silence the urging of love!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is hard to find those who give because of a true love for the brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Verse 18:"Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue but in deed and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Not only in "deed" but in "truthfulness" as well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many deeds of love are not truthful!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Verse 22:"And whatever we ask we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is difficult to find a believer who is not ashamed in his heart vv.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>20-21 , much less to find one who keeps God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Verse 24:"And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God abides in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>1 JOHN 4</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Verse 1:"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Prove first and then believe, not believe first and then prove.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Without proving, one should not believe, and one should not believe in anything that has not been proven.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>"But prove!"</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Verse 2:"In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To "confess" means to acknowledge voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you get an answer that does not answer what is asked, it must be an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Concerning this kind of question, any answer other than "Yes, yes; No, no" Matt 5:37 cannot be considered a "confessing."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord Jesus says that "for anything more than these is of the evil one."</S>
