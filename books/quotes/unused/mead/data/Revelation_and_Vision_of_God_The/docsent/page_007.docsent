   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the Development of the Theology of the Trinity in the Latin Language Personae, Essentia</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the theological studies entered into the Latin language, the term personae was used to refer to the aspect of the Divine Trinity's being three.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word has three meanings: first, it was used in the ancient Roman Empire to refer to the masks put on by an actor in playing different roles; second, it refers to a role in a play, and by extension, to the role of one with an important position in a government or to the role of a significant member of a family; and third, it denotes "person."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With regard to the aspect of the Divine Trinity's being one, the word essentia in Latin is used; it denotes "essence," "intrinsic nature."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the Development of the Theology of the Trinity in the English Language Hypostases, Persons, Substance, Essence</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hypostases, which is the Greek word hupostases anglicized, means "substantial, dependable supports"; stasis is equivalent to the English word substance, referring to something real and substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Out of the Latin word personae came the word persons, and the Greek word ousia became the word essence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning San-wei-i-t'i in the Chinese Language</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Western missionaries came to China, they used a simple expression, san-wei-i-t'i, to express the concept of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wei denotes "person," "substance"; t'i refers neither to a physical body nor to a corporate body, but to an entity, to the essence of a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, san-wei-i-t'i means that although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three in person or in substance, They are one in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT FOR THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fifteen years ago in Hong Kong I released some messages on the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These messages were later compiled into a book entitled, Concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This book clearly outlines six heresies throughout the ages and one proper explanation concerning the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is altogether based upon the research done by the theologians in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Recently, a publication was put out in Hong Kong that covers exactly the same things in the same sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would like to speak a word to all of you who are learning to serve the Lord: The way of the Lord's recovery today is a way that completely repudiates the traditions of Christianity, including Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, those who are in Christianity are not happy with us since we renounce what they teach.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Formerly, in mainland China Brother Watchman Nee was the target of the attacks from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Afterward, when I was sent abroad, I also became a target, even though that was not what I wanted to be.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In America because of our proclaiming the truth, we were libeled and slandered and were therefore forced to file two lawsuits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In one case there was a settlement, and the opposing party issued a public apology in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the other case the opposing party, after losing, intentionally declared bankruptcy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By presenting the truth, we have quelled the waves; now there is no more scornful reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in the East the situation is still unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the future wherever you go, whether in the East or in the West, you will meet people who are in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most important thing is that you should be able to present the truth concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, I feel that I should help you to have a clear knowledge to understand the pure revelation of the Holy Scriptures.</S>
