 <h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The Bible is still the &ldquo;best seller.&rdquo; It is translated into more languages than any other book written by man. More than six hundred million Bibles were sent out in 1989.</p>
<p>The Bible is most definitely the precious gift of God for man. God did not write a book in heaven and send it down by an angel to man. He did not just inspire one well-known man of God to write a book for Him. First, there was the speaking of God to many godly men for nearly 2,500 years. Then Moses took the lead to write down God&rsquo;s revelations. After having been written by more than forty men over a period of 1,600 years, and after having been tested by being read and experienced by God&rsquo;s people for over one thousand years, the final sixty-six books were at last canonized to be the Word of God. But shortly thereafter, the Bible was locked up by the Roman Catholic Church. Many faithful believers were put to death for having the Bible in their possession. After a thousand years, Martin Luther and his co-workers liberated the Bible from the unlawful custody of the Roman Catholic Church and made it available to the common people. However, most people received very little revelation in reading the Bible. Finally, after another five hundred years of extensive study and research, most of the Bible has been opened to us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We did not receive all the revelations direct from God, but gathered many of them from an accumulation of revelations recorded over the past six thousand years. What we have in the recovery today is the cream of the revelation of God and the rich experiences of the saints and the churches throughout church history. We should treasure the Bible and all the recovery books that unveil the Bible to us! How much we need to study the Word with the help of the ministry! &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I want to give myself to devour Your Word until I am full of You and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo;</p>
