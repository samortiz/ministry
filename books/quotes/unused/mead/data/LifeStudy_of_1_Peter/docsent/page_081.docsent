   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUFFERING IN THE FLESH AND CEASING FROM SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:1 Peter points out that those who have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Pleasure heats up the lusts of our flesh v. 2 ; suffering cools them down.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The purpose of Christ s redemption is to deliver us from our inherited vain manner of life 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suffering responds to Christ s redemption in this purpose, preserving us from the sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissipation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such suffering, mostly from persecution, is God s discipline in His governmental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To undergo such suffering is to be judged, dealt with, and disciplined by God in the flesh v. 6 . Hence, we should arm ourselves with a sober mind to endure such suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In God s economy suffering accomplishes a good work for God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suffering very much restricts our lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more material enjoyment people have, the more they will exercise their lusts and indulge in them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if we suffer poverty, persecution, or illness, this suffering will restrict the indulgence of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is common knowledge that the rich commit more lustful sins than the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you have vast riches and do not need to work, you will be able to spend your time indulging yourself in your lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may travel around the world seeking pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Lord may limit you financially so that you hardly have enough money for the necessities of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to labor long hours to earn a living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result of your labors, you have neither the time nor the energy to indulge yourself in your lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even the desire to pursue lustful pleasure is killed by your poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is dangerous to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are wealthy and drive a luxurious car to make a display, immediately the lust in your heart will be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think that because you are a Christian and have the divine life, you cannot be tempted in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Devil uses riches to stir up lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God, however, uses suffering in the flesh to cause us to cease from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>LIVING IN THE WILL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 2 Peter goes on to say, No longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse indicates that we should live no longer in the vain manner of life handed down from the fathers 1:18 , but in a holy and excellent manner of life 1:15; 2:12 , pure in holy fear and good in Christ 3:2, 16 , which is the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not easy to stay away from lusts and do God s will when we are rich in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason God assigns a certain portion of suffering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These sufferings restrict our lusts and preserve us in the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this sense we all should worship God for our sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should tell Him, Lord, how I worship You that in Your sovereignty You have assigned sufferings to me so that I may be preserved in Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be afraid that our sufferings will be too great.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord knows how to assign sufferings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He charges husbands to assign a certain portion of honor to their wives, surely He Himself knows how much suffering to assign to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will not assign either too little or too much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His assignment will be in the right proportion; it will be exactly what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A brother may say, Recently I have been so happy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But today I lost my job and I am deeply depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This brother needs to realize that this suffering has been assigned to him from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the brother may say, It was due to inflation and the poor economy that I lost my job.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can you say that this comes from the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Apparently, this brother lost his job because of the economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the economy and everything related to it is under God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, even losing a job is something assigned from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, the opposition we face, even from members of our own family, may be a suffering assigned to us by God for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A PICTURE OF THE VAIN MANNER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 3 Peter says, For the time which has passed is sufficient to have wrought the desire of the nations, having gone on in sensuality, lusts, debaucheries, carousings, drinking bouts, and unlawful idolatries.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Literally the Greek word rendered desire here is purpose, will; that is, intention, inclination; hence, desire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the negative things listed in this verse are related to the vain manner of life 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the negative expressions in this verse denote indulgence in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sensuality denotes indulgence in sex, and lusts are different kinds of indulgences.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>People may have various lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, worldly people may have a lust for adornment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only do they have that kind of lust, but they indulge in it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word debaucheries means indulgence in the drinking of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It refers to an excess of wine drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Carousings signifies an eating and drinking together with evil companions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Carousing involves shouting and noise-making without limitation or restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Peter also speaks in verse 3 of drinking bouts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>People engage in drinking bouts when they try to outdo one another in drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They may compete to see who can drink more.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The words Peter uses in verse 3 portray the corruption in society at the time of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Roman Empire was defeated not only by foreign armies; it was defeated because of its own inward corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Knowing the history of the Roman Empire, we are concerned about our country today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This country is powerful militarily, but there is much inward corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Consider the activities of many worldly people on the weekends.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first day of the week was arranged by God to be a free day so that we may worship Him and learn the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But worldly people use this day to indulge in sensuality, lust, debaucheries, carousings, and drinking bouts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a description of the manner of life of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In verse 3 Peter tells us that the time which has passed is sufficient for us to have worked the desire of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No longer should we live that way.</S>
