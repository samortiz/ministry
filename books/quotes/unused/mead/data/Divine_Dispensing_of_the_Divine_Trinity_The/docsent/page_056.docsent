   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit s Sealing and Pledging</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Application of God s Accomplished Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit s dispensing is His sealing unto the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of His glory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seal of the Holy Spirit is living, and it works within us to permeate and transform us with God s element until we are matured in God s life and eventually fully redeemed even in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God seals us with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may illustrate this sealing with a rubber stamp and a piece of blank paper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By stamping the blank piece of paper, we dispense the ink onto the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we stamp the paper again and again, eventually it will be saturated and soaked with the ink.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only is sonship a matter of life-dispensing, but the sealing of the Spirit also involves life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day after day, the Spirit is sealing us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you were a sinner, you were like an unclean sheet of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But one day you repented to God and called on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His blood washed you, cleansed you, and made you like a piece of clean blank paper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time the Spirit sealed you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to know who the Spirit is who sealed us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Son came, He came with the Father, and when the Spirit came, He came with the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit is actually the application of the Son and the Father to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The rubber stamp is the application of the ink to the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you put the stamp on the paper, the ink is added to the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit is the consummation and the reaching of the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He seals us, the entire Triune God reaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit not only reaches us; He is also attached to us 2 Cor 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reaching is His attaching, and the attaching is also His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has reached us, and He has been attached to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The divine sealing, the life-dispensing of the Triune God, is taking place within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sealing of the Spirit is unto the redemption of the acquired possession 1:13b, 14b .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some versions say until , but unto is more meaningful because it means resulting in. We were acquired by God as His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From the day He acquired us, He began the sealing in order to saturate us with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is too objective simply to say that we have God s seal upon us as a mark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We not only have a seal but also have a sealing to saturate our entire being with God s element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our body has not yet been redeemed; it still is a natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we have a sealing, the saturating, of the Holy Spirit, within us, and this sealing will continue until the day our body is fully saturated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That will be the redemption of our body, the redemption of God s acquired possession.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now, as God s acquired possession, we are still under the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit is also a pledge, a foretaste, of our divine inheritance, guaranteeing the full taste of God as our eternal inheritance v. 14a . This word pledge is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It means earnest, security, guarantee, and also foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to an ancient practice, when someone bought a piece of land, the seller would give him a bag of soil as a sample for a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That soil was a guarantee that the purchaser would get the land with the same soil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an illustration of the fact that the sealing Spirit, after sealing us, remains within us to be our foretaste of God as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, two things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, we became God s inheritance, God s possession, with His seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God sealed us with the Spirit as a sign that we belong to Him as His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time God became our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He became our portion and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The sealing Spirit is a sign that we are His possession, and the sealing Spirit also becomes a pledge, a foretaste, of the very God who is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This foretaste is a guarantee, security, that one day we shall enjoy the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both the sealing and the pledging are life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every day the Spirit is sealing us and pledging Himself into our being as our foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This foretaste of the pledging is a guarantee of the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Triune God is sealing us and pledging Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the dispensing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the end of verse 14 we have once again the phrase, To the praise of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This phrase is used three times: first, for the Father s dispensing in verse 6; second, for the Son s dispensing in verse 12; and third, for the Spirit s dispensing in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This threefold mentioning of the praise of God s glory signifies the threefold dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
