 <h2 class="head2">Growth in Life Being for the Building Up</h2>
<p>We need to grow, but merely to grow is not good enough. Growth is for the building. Although Christians today pay some amount of attention to the growth, they mostly neglect the matter of building. Ephesians 4:15 speaks of growth, and verse 16 speaks of building. These two verses say, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Similarly, Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; Ephesians 4:16 mentions the joints of the rich supply, and Colossians 2:19 speaks of the joints and sinews. Joints are for nourishment, the supply, and sinews are for knitting together.</p>
<p>We need to grow into Christ the Head in all things. If we do not grow into Christ, we cannot receive anything from Him, but the more we grow into Him, the more we receive something from Him to minister to others. In the Body the joints are the members of supply, the members of nourishment that supply nourishment to other members. In the Body some members are also the sinews to knit together. Without the sinews, all the members are scattered. It is by the sinews that all the members are joined.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
THROUGH THE FUNCTIONS OF ALL THE MEMBERS</h2>
<p>The verses mentioned above speak of four categories: the Head, the joints, the sinews, and all the other parts. First, we have Christ as the Head. We all have to grow into Him and receive something from Him as the Head, the source of supply. Second, there are the joints who receive the rich supply from the Head to minister to the other members. Third, there are the sinews, whose main ministry is not only to supply but to knit together. It is by them and through them that the many members are joined together. Fourth, Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Through the operation in the measure of each one part.&rdquo; Besides the Head, the joints, and the sinews, there are the many parts, the many members who are neither the Head, the joints, nor the sinews. The eyes, ears, nose, and hands are not joints or sinews, but they are parts of the body that have their operation. With every member there is the operation in its measure. We need to know the Head, Christ. We must learn to experience Him and grow into Him. Then we will receive something from Him. As we grow into Him and receive something from Him, we are in our function. It is by our function that the whole Body is built up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Head Building Up the Church<br />
through the Gifted Persons Indirectly</h2>
<p>Some people claim that according to Matthew 16 it is only the Lord Himself who can build His church. According to their thought, we are too proud when we say that we, the members, build up the church. This sounds good, but the Lord Jesus does not built up the church directly. He builds up the church through the gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11 and 12. These verses say, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; The Head does not build up the church directly. The Head builds up the church through the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Many Members<br />
Building Up the Church Directly</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, even the gifted persons do not build up the church directly. According to verse 12, they perfect the saints, and the saints build up the church. Verses 13 through 15 go on to speak of the growth, and verse 16 speaks of the building up. The real building up is by all the saints, that is, by all the members. The building up of the church is not directly by the gifted persons nor directly by the Head. The Head builds the church through the gifted persons, the gifted persons perfect the members, and the members themselves directly build up the church.</p>
<p>We can use cooking to illustrate the function of the gifted persons and all the members. If a brother&rsquo;s wife is not at home to cook for him, he may go hungry. Spiritually speaking, though, we all must be the &ldquo;cooks&rdquo; day by day. Even if we are not experts in cooking, we still have to cook. Sometimes we may have to invite an expert to teach us how to cook, but he should not replace us in cooking. The gifted persons should not replace the saints. No one should say to a gifted person, &ldquo;You are the expert. Please do the cooking for us.&rdquo; The expert should say, &ldquo;Since I am the expert, let me teach you how to cook. I will do the teaching; you will do the cooking. Do not expect that I will replace you as the cook. You have to do it. Perhaps I will do it for you once or twice to show you the way, but to be sure, the third time you will have to do it. Then, if you do not cook, you will not eat.&rdquo; This illustrates the way the gifted members perfect the saints so that the saints can build up the church directly. The church, the Body, is built up directly by the saints who are perfected through the ministry of the gifted persons.</p>
