   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY-FOUR THE MAN-SAVIOR S RESURRECTION 5 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20; 12:24b; 1 Pet 1:3; Eph 1:20-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider further the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the Man-Savior s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we shall go on to see that His resurrection also involves both germination and propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE MAN-SAVIOR S GERMINATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OF THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TO IMPART THE DIVINE LIFE INTO HIS BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>FOR THEIR REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus says that if a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a matter of germination through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning this, Peter says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ was resurrected, we His believers, were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we were resurrected with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His resurrection, He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Dead Hearing the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Being Germinated</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that all fallen human beings are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A person begins to die from the moment of birth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we may say that people are dying, the Bible reveals that sinners are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 2:1 and 5 say that, as sinners, we were dead in offenses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Colossians 2:13 also says that we were dead in offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these verses God seems to be saying, You may think that human beings are living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fallen human beings are not living they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 5:25 we see that when we preach the gospel, we are actually preaching to those who are spiritually dead: Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we see a positive point: those who are spiritually dead still have ears to hear the voice of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that the dead in spirit are still able to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, the Bible tells us that fallen human beings are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the other hand, the Bible says that even those who are spiritually dead can hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is of God s mercy and sovereignty that the dead have ears to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a spiritually dead person hears the gospel, he may say, I believe in Jesus; I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then as he calls on the name of the Lord Jesus, the divine life is imparted to him, and he is germinated to become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Becoming a New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before we were germinated through the Man-Savior s resurrection, we were the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But from the time of our germination we began to be the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, which consists of believers born again of God John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 , does have the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we are a new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 , not according to the old nature of flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the old creation is germinated with the divine life it becomes the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We, the believers in Christ, who have been germinated through His resurrection, are now the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The old creation does not have God in it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the new creation begins by God coming into us in the way of germination.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord that we have been germinated!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through this impartation of the divine life we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers for their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The second point related to the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s resurrection is that it is His germination of the new creation to impart the divine life into the believers for their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps we did not realize what happened to us when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we see that when we were regenerated we were germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may say that this germination was a divine injection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The divine life was injected into us at the time we believed in Christ and were regenerated, and that injection was our germination.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah, the divine life has been injected, infused, into our inner being!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That infusion was our rebirth, our regeneration.</S>
