According to Jehovah's Commandment,<br>the Daughters of Zelophehad Marrying the Sons<br>of Their Uncles, and Their Inheritance Remaining<br>in the Tribe of the Family of Their Father</H2><P>The daughters of Zelophehad did according to Jehovah's commandment to Moses, marrying the sons of their uncles (vv. 10-11). "They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father" (v. 12). Once again we see that the freedom we have from God is not unlimited. Rather, the freedom, the liberty, we have received in Christ must always be limited by God's regulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Case of Mary,<br>the Mother of the Lord Jesus, Marrying<br>Joseph Being One That Fulfilled This Statute</H2><P>The case of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus, marrying Joseph was one that fulfilled this statute. Hence, such a statute concerns Christ in His incarnation.</P><P>If we compare the genealogies of the Lord Jesus in Matthew and Luke, we will see that Mary was a descendant of Nathan, a son of David, and that Joseph was a descendant of Solomon, another son of David. Joseph might have come from a poor family and Mary, from a rich family. In such a case, there would have been an inheritance on Mary's side but not on Joseph's side. However, when Joseph and Mary were married, her inheritance became his. The two, Mary and Joseph, became one for the bringing forth of Jesus. This indicates that even such a statute as that in Numbers 36:1-12 concerns Christ in His incarnation. This shows that all Scripture is a record concerning Christ, directly or indirectly.</P><P>The Bible reveals Christ, and the Bible is a record concerning Christ. The statute in chapter thirty-six was actually ordained by God for Christ's incarnation. The cities of refuge in Numbers 35 are a type of Christ, and the settlement of the problem regarding the inheritance in Numbers 36 is related to Christ. This means that even the last chapter of the book of Numbers is concerned with Christ, in particular Christ's incarnation. If Christ had not been incarnated, He could not have become the cities of refuge for the human race. Thus, in a very real sense, the refuge cities in chapter thirty-five depend upon the statute in chapter thirty-six. If we see this, we will appreciate the requests of the daughters of Zelophehad and of the heads of the fathers' houses of the families of the sons of Joseph, and we will appreciate the way this problem was solved according to the word of the Lord.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_180.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_182.html">Next</a> </body></html>
