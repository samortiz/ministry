<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO RIVALRY OR VAINGLORY</H2><P>Verse 3 says, "Let nothing be done by the way of rivalry or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves" (Gk.). According to this verse, there must have been rivalry and the seeking of vainglory among the Philippians. This is not the way to enjoy Christ. The enjoyment of Christ has nothing to do with rivalry or vainglory. If we do anything by the way of rivalry or vainglory, we are through with the experience of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LOOKING ON THE QUALITIES OF OTHERS</H2><P>Verse 4 says, "Look not every man on his own qualities, but every man also on those of others" (Gk.). No doubt, some of the Philippians were looking on their own qualities, on their own good points. But Paul was telling them to look also on the qualities of others. Then, according to the Greek, in verse 5 Paul said, "Think this, which was also in Christ Jesus." In other words, Paul was telling them to think whatever Christ thought. This is the way for us to enjoy Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING A CO-SOUL</H2><P>In this message we have seen the detailed way to enjoy Christ. First, we need to preach the gospel in the fellowship of the gospel. In order to keep ourselves in the fellowship of the gospel, we need to deal with our soul and be one in soul. Actually, the Greek word translated "one in soul" in Philippians 2:2 should be translated "co-soul." We all need to have the same soul. The problem today is that we do not have a co-soul. Thus, we are one in spirit, but we are different in soul. We can pray, praise, and sing together because all this is in the spirit. But we may not be able to talk together. This indicates that we are one in spirit, but not one in soul. In the meetings we have a co-spirit, but in our daily walk we do not have a co-soul. For the enjoyment of Christ, we need such a co-soul. We need to be together in the soul as well as in the spirit.</P>
