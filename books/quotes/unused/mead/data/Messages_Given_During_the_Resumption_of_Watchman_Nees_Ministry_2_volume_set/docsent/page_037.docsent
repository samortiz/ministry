   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Law of the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fourth, there is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This law comes into us at the time we believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With which part do we receive the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We receive Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With every saved person, there is the law of good, the law of evil, and the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law of good is in the soul, and the law of evil is in the body, whereas the law of life is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the three parts of man, the spirit, the soul, and the body, have their own laws.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose a brother becomes angry with his wife in the evening, and he begins to beat her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the operation of the law of evil in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The next morning his reason takes over, and he changes his attitude, and he becomes polite to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the operation of the law of reason in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the afternoon when he fellowships with God and is filled with Him, he begins to bear a spiritual taste, and this is the operation of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law of good in the soul desires to obey the law of God and to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the law of evil in the body frustrates it and causes a person to sin and to rebel against God's law, and to come under judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thanks be to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here is the law of the Spirit of life to be man's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It delivers man from the law of evil and good, and it causes man to transcend, to rise above good to satisfy God's law and to more than conquer all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE NEED FOR A CHRISTIAN TO LIVE BY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, we should not be a Christian according to the first, second, or third law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we should be a Christian according to the fourth law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If someone on the street hits you, why would you not hit him back?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some say that it is because the Bible tells us not to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you say this, you are acting according to the first law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a wife submits to her husband, and children submit to their parents, these submissions may be something according to the first law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be a Christian in this way is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps some would say that they want to be a good man and that they have made up their mind to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to live according to the second law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then there are those who say that if others hit them, they would surely retaliate, and they would retaliate in a stronger way than they were hit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is to fall into the third law, the law of evil in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is wrong to live according to the first, the second, or the third law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I do not retaliate, it should be because my spirit feels not to retaliate, and because to retaliate would make me feel uncomfortable and cause my spirit to protest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a wife submits to her husband, it should be because her spirit is telling her to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do this, we are living according to the fourth law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we live according to the fourth law, we will be able to say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only by being this kind of Christian will we have peace, and only then will we be at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Shanghai someone asked me once, "Why can't I smoke?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I said, "If you can smoke in peace, go ahead and smoke more."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you can hit your wife in peace, and if by hitting her, you can be brought to God, go ahead and hit her some more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the other hand, if by loving your wife you can gain the peace and can bring God into you, you should go ahead and love her more.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If your love does not bring you peace, this kind of love is appalling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should be fellowshipping with the Lord within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have peace to do something, we should go ahead and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not have the peace, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should be a comfortable, peaceful, happy, and joyful Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not deceive ourselves or others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only such Christians will meet God, and only they will see the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi prayed: May the Lord lead men to God through His servant's words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May the words open man's understanding and enlighten man's inner being, so that the brothers and sisters would have a pure heart toward the Lord and would not become Christians who live according to morality or by resolutions, but would become Christians who live out their life in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Grant Your children's conscience, spirit, and intuition to have sensitive responses.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Amen.</S>
