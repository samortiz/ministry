   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REASON FOR THIS BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the mercy of God, in 1947 the church in Shanghai in China experienced a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the same time, co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consequently, toward the end of 1947 Sister Peace Wang, Rachel Lee, and I first went to Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Afterwards we went to Canton, Swatow, and Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, in March the following year we went to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In all these places we held special revival conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the meetings in Foochow, the two sisters and I went according to our previously-arranged schedule to have some private fellowship with Brother Nee at his home concerning the future of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the news went out, about thirty to forty co-workers around the Foochow area unanimously requested that they be admitted to the fellowship also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Upon Brother Nee's approval, they all attended those meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During these meetings, it was brought out one day the need of "handing over" oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All agreed enthusiastically to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Subsequently, this move brought in the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, Brother Nee took care of the need of the meeting in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After that, he went with me in April of that year to Shanghai to conduct a nationwide co-workers' conference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout this period, Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and his wife were in most of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The content of this book is their brief records of these meetings in various places.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of all these meetings throughout this period of the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry, I was present in all except the first two meetings, and I was even helping to conduct the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I sat face to face with our brother and heard these messages with my own ears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The light that was released was like the shining of the midday sun.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Forty-three years have since elapsed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is indeed the need at present to let its light shine forth once again as the rising sun.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fortunately, under the Lord's sovereignty, we have with us the remaining manuscripts of the brief records by Brother Weigh and his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I read them again, every message was filled with the dawning light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help are eight things: 1 the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, 2 the knowledge and denial of the self, 3 the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, 4 the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem," 5 the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, 6 the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, 7 the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and 8 the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord grant us the mercy, the grace, and the blessing, that all the above points would be abundantly realized in our work and service of the Lord's recovery.</S>
