Although it was a long journey, he brought her through and presented her to Isaac as his bride. The Holy Spirit has convinced us and now He is bringing us to Christ. Although it is a long journey, eventually He will bring us through and present us to Christ as His lovely bride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(3) The Church's Response</H2><P>Now we must see the church's response. As we have seen, Rebekah responded immediately, being willing to go with the servant to Isaac. Although there is within our old, fallen nature a reluctance to follow the Lord immediately, we cannot deny that there is also within us the willingness to follow Him. Although we are still in this old nature, it is nevertheless easy for us to follow the Lord. It is much easier to follow Him than not to follow Him. Do not believe the lie of the enemy that you can easily be frustrated in following the Lord. Tell the enemy, "Nothing can frustrate my desire to follow the Lord. Deep within me there is the longing to follow Him." Satan is a liar. Sometimes he even lies to us through preachers who speak negative things and tell us that we cannot love the Lord Jesus. Do not believe the lies, but declare, "No! I can and I do love the Lord Jesus!" We may even lie to ourselves, saying, "I'm so weak. I just can't follow the Lord. I'd better turn around and go back." We must reject this lie and say, "I will never go back. I will follow the Lord Jesus." Never believe the lie that you do not love the Lord. Tell the enemy, "I love the Lord Jesus. My loving Him does not depend upon my ability to love. It depends on His being so lovable. Because He is lovable, I cannot help loving Him." If I gave you a pair of old shoes, you would reject them, saying, "I don't care for those!" But if I gave you some diamonds, you would easily love them, not because you have the ability to love but because the diamonds are lovable. Likewise, we do not love the Lord Jesus because we are able to love; we love Him because He is so lovable. In Genesis 24, it was not Rebekah who was able to love Isaac and respond to him; it was Isaac who was lovable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(a) Doing What the Spirit Expects</H2><P>Our response to the Holy Spirit is that we always do what He expects. Abraham's servant expected that Rebekah would give him a drink of water and then draw water for his ten camels, and Rebekah did exactly what he expected (vv. 18-20), satisfying the servant's thirst. Often we have unconsciously done what the Holy Spirit expected, satisfying His desire, doing it without knowing what He expected. Our doing this was a sign that we were under the moving of the Spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_369.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_371.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 370</div><br></body></html>
