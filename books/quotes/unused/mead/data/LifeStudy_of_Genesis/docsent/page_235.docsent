   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Building a City</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Have a Manmade, Godless Life</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building by human labor with the misused earth is simply to build up a manmade, godless life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The city built at Babel could grow nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was godless and lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Look at human culture, at society, and at the situation throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What are the people doing?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are burning the earth into bricks in order to build up a city that is without God and without life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is today's society.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every society is a Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today's society is built up with bricks made by men who burn the element that grows life out of the earth created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every organization in today's society is burning the earth into bricks and building up a Babel that is godless and lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you ever seen a society that is not doing this?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have seen such a thing, it must be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church does not burn the earth; the church plows the earth and sows seed into it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is not building up a lifeless and godless city; it is building up a city that is godly and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The building in the church is with precious stones, not with bricks that come out of burning the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only in secular society but even to some degree in so-called Christian society, in Christianity, people are burning the earth into bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are burning to death the element that grows life in order to build up a city that is godless and lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that everyone in the church will see the difference between the church and any type of society.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is unique in that it does not burn the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church plows the earth, sows seed into it, and waters it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That life seed, which is Christ, will grow and produce materials for the building up of God's holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what the church is doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, every other society, including many of the so-called Christian groups, are burning the element that grows life for the purpose of building up a city that is godless and lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But here in the church life we are not burning the earth; we are watering it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are doing the work of planting and growing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are plowing, sowing, watering, and growing; we are not burning or killing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do have a building, the building of God, but it is not built with man-made bricks or by human labor; it is built with God-created and transformed stones and by the divine work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Building a Tower</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>to Declare the Renouncing of God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I was young I did not understand why those people at Babel built a tower as well as a city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What was the purpose of the tower?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you read this portion of the holy Word, you will find that the tower was a declaration made to the whole universe, especially to God, that man had become independent of God and everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle of a city with a tower is the same in human society today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A tower signifies advertisement.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even in Christian work there may be the building of a tower for advertisement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A certain Dr. So-and-So may be advertised as a world-famous preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That advertisement is a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In such a case, Jesus Christ would not have as great a name as Dr. So-and-So, the world-famous preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>People go to hear him, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Big signs, extensive advertisements these are the building of a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Babel is the source of Babylon, for Babylon is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, we not only have Babel in Genesis 11 but Babylon in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Babylon found in Revelation 17 is today's Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many leaders in today's Christianity know that Babylon in Revelation 17 is Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, they continue building their own Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only do they remain in Babylon, they are building it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They want to build their towers as high as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One day as I was considering this kind of situation, the Lord showed me that the city of Babel is like a tomb and that the tower is like a tombstone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a tomb does not have a tombstone, it will be incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When people erect a sign for advertisement, they should realize that it is a tombstone, a mark of the dead.</S>
