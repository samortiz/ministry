The first six chapters reveal that He is involved with the Persian Empire, and the last six chapters reveal that He is involved with the Grecian Empire and the Roman Empire. As we have seen, the center of the prophecies in chapters nine through eleven is Christ as the rejected Messiah. In chapters twelve through fourteen, Christ is unveiled as the Messiah returning to be enthroned as the King not only over Israel but over the whole world. His first coming, described in Zechariah 9&#151;11, was humble and intimate; His coming back, described in Zechariah 12&#151;14, will be with power and authority.</P><P>Zechariah 12&#151;14 covers the prophecy concerning Israel's destiny in three matters: in the great war of Armageddon (12:1-9; 14:1-7, 12-15), in their household salvation (12:10&#151;13:9), and in the millennium (14:8-11, 16-21). In this message we will consider the prophecy of encouragement regarding Israel's destiny in the great war of Armageddon. However, first I would like to give a word concerning the significance of the human spirit as revealed in 12:1.</P><P>This verse says, "The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him." The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, live God, fulfill God's purpose for God, and be one with God. It is marvelous that such a verse as this is in an Old Testament book which unveils a Christ who is so involved with human history and politics. This indicates that in His economy God planned to have Christ as the centrality and universality of His move on earth. As the very God, He has ruled over the entire human race, managing the world situation age after age for thousands of years. For His chosen people, who would care for Him as the Creator and as the Redeemer, there was the need for Him to create a receiver so that they would have the capacity to receive all that God had planned for Christ to be. Christ is wonderful, but if we did not have a spirit, how could we receive Him? Today in every circle of society, people do not exercise their spirit. Even in religious circles, the matter of the human spirit is neglected or even opposed and denied. If we neglect our human spirit, there is no way for us to contact God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
