   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of life, not the Spirit of power, is the central line of the revelation concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person's life is obviously more central and crucial than his clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may put on and take off a piece of clothing, but you cannot put on your life and then take it off.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, the Spirit of life is essential; the Spirit of power is not essential.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether or not we have the Spirit of power, we are still living because we have the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit of life is essential to my constitution and my being, and is essentially vital.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the Spirit of power is not so essential, but is only economical.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's promise in John 14 concerning the Spirit of life was to make us alive, to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this Spirit we have been regenerated to be the children of God, and by this Spirit of life we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is our essence; it is essential to our spiritual being and is vital to our spiritual constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the Spirit of life, we could not be children of God; we could have never been regenerated and could never be spiritually constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>RECEIVING THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>ESSENTIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to God's economy there was still the need of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Baptism is not regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must not confuse baptism with regeneration, as some believers today do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the day of resurrection the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He came in the evening to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time the disciples received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, fifty days later at Pentecost the Spirit still descended upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since He was born of the Holy Spirit, He surely had the Holy Spirit essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, after His baptism, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him economically Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was the same with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the day of resurrection the Holy Spirit entered into them, and they received the Holy Spirit essentially for their spiritual existence and being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet after fifty days, the Holy Spirit descended upon them economically, just as the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus after His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some Christians are accustomed to asking others, "Have you received the Holy Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In reply to this question I would ask two more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First I would ask, "Before the Lord Jesus was baptized, had He received the Holy Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I would ask, "Before the day of Pentecost, had all the disciples received the Holy Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some would answer that the disciples before the day of Pentecost did not receive the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit descended upon them on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, in John 20 on the day of resurrection the Lord came and breathed upon them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some have said that this was merely a demonstration in which nothing happened, and that this demonstration was fulfilled fifty days later on the day of Pentecost when the Spirit came.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this respect we should consider the case of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the four Gospels he made many mistakes, but in Acts 1 Peter became so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He knew how to interpret the Scriptures, and he took the lead with the one hundred twenty to pray in one accord for ten days vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>13-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only a few weeks before this time the disciples were fighting with one another Matt 20:20-24 , but now they could pray together in one accord, even under the threatening of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They did not care for the threatening of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They kept the Lord's word to tarry in Jerusalem, and they prayed together in one accord, not just for one prayer meeting, but for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If they did not have the Spirit within them, how could they do this?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It would have been impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was a strong sign that before the day of Pentecost, in Acts 1, they had the Spirit within them already.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the essential Spirit, the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Acts 1, Peter and all the one hundred twenty disciples were really spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They were altogether in the Spirit, and they were full of the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, they could be one and they could pray together in one accord for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They did this not by themselves but by the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When did the Spirit of life enter into them?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was on the day of resurrection in John 20:22.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The disciples had the life within, but they still did not have the power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They had drunk the living water, but they did not have the proper uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To drink water is essential; to put on a uniform is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may be drinking water in your kitchen, but when you come out to meet me, you cannot come without the proper clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To drink water is essential for you to exist, but to put on the proper clothing is economical for you to meet someone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the day of resurrection the disciples began to drink the "water," yet they did not have the power from on high to clothe them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They had all received the Holy Spirit, they were all regenerated, and they had all become children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet they were not made one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They were still individual children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now, according to God's economy, God had to put all His sons together to baptize them in the Spirit of God into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
