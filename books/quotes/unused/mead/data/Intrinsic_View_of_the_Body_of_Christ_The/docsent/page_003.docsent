   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The burden of these messages concerning the Body of Christ can be expressed in the following four statements:</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 The Body of Christ is the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2 Christ created the two, Jews and Gentiles, in Himself into one new man as the poem of God, that God might display the surpassing riches of His grace toward us in Christ Eph 2:15, 10, 7.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3 To be strengthened into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:16-17, 19.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4 One Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, an indivisible mingling of the Triune God with the believers in Christ Eph 4:4-6, 12-16.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our burden for this conference is on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Ephesians is not merely concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a book on the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No other book of the New Testament refers to the Body of Christ as much as Ephesians does.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 1 says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Chapter two says that Christ created the two, the Jewish and Gentile believers, into one new man that He might reconcile both in one Body to God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What a mystery and what a gospel this is!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even our reconciliation to God is not an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the believers have been reconciled to God in one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Chapter three tells us that in Christ Jesus the saved Gentiles and the saved Jews are fellow members of the Body v. 6 and that this Body is the fullness of God v. 19 for the ultimate corporate expression of the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapter four speaks of one Body, one Lord, one God and Father, vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>4-6 and of all the saints needing to be perfected that they may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This chapter also says that out from the Head, Christ, all the Body grows by the members growing so that the Body can be built up by itself through all the functioning members in love v. 16 . This is the Body of Christ in Ephesians.</S>
