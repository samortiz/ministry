<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for bringing us once again to Your Word. Open and release Your mystery to us that we would see God’s eternal economy. Lord, open our hearts and give us a spirit of wisdom and understanding that we would enter into Your heart’s desire in a genuine way and would see Your eternal economy. Lord, cleanse us again with Your precious blood, and anoint us again with Your holy anointing oil that both the speaker as well as the listener would enjoy Your presence and touch You. Lord, give us also the utterance to speak forth the fresh words that bear the supply of life and are full of revelation and light. Lord Jesus, we really love Your precious name. We come again to receive You. Supply us that we would all be filled by You to enjoy the riches from on high. May You gain the glory. May we be satisfied and the enemy be shamed. Amen!<p>In this chapter we want to see God’s economy according to the revelation in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, God gave us the types and the pictures. In the New Testament, God gave us the clear words and revelation. The whole New Testament is the revelation of God. There is no need for us to guess or to conjecture. God has already spoken to us the mystery hidden in Him.<p>We know that God’s economy is to work Himself as the Triune God into us, the tripartite men, that we would have His life and nature to become the sons of God and the members of Christ to be constituted the Body of Christ, which is the church, the expression of Christ. This is the goal of God’s economy; it is what God has desired throughout the ages. This universal Body also includes those who believe in Christ in all times and all ages. Christ is the Head and we are the Body. He and we together constitute a great universal man. The One who dwells and lives within this great man is the Triune God Himself. He lives in this Body. For this reason, whenever we meet together we feel that God is here, for this is the house of God. Here heaven and earth are joined together, and God and man are joined as one.<p>We have seen that in eternity past God had a plan, an intention, an arrangement, and an economy. In time He accomplishes this economy step by step. The first step was creation. He created the heavens, the earth, all things, and man. Man is the center of God’s creation. Although the heaven is high and the earth is expansive and all the things on it are lovely and beautiful, God considers man as the most precious of them all. This is because man is created in God’s image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26) for the purpose of containing God. Hence, man is after God’s kind. Because we as men are after God’s kind, God can be grafted into us, and we can be grafted into God. This is what the Lord Jesus meant when He said that He is the vine and we are the branches (John 15:5). When He enters into us, we are grafted into Him.<h2 class=head1>GOD BECOMING FLESH TO BRING HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2><p>When did God put Himself into man after He created man? He waited four thousand years. One day in the universe and among mankind a tremendous thing happened. It was something more important than the creation of the heaven and the earth. God became flesh. The God who is the Creator of all things entered into man, being conceived of the Holy Spirit to be born of a virgin. His name was called Jesus. By becoming flesh He brought Himself into man to become a mysterious God-man. He is God, yet He is also man. He is a genuine, proper, and normal man. He was born in Bethlehem, raised in Nazareth, and lived in a poor carpenter’s home. At the age of thirty, He came forth to fulfill His commission, working for God and preaching the gospel of God, expressing God before man. His words and deeds often surprised and shocked those who followed Him. Sometimes His words were great yet simple. He said, “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12), “I am the bread that came down out of heaven” (John 6:41), “I am the way, and the reality, and the life” (John 14:6). In human history, there have been many sages and saints. But no one, whether a religious leader or a philosopher, ever said the same things that the Lord Jesus said. Moreover, there are many religions in the world. But no matter what religion it is, those in it are never called the believers in the Lord. Only those believing in Jesus are called the believers in the Lord. This is because only He is the Lord. After the Lord’s crucifixion and resurrection, He appeared to His disciple, Thomas. When Thomas recognized Him he said, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28). No disciple of any person ever calls his teacher this. There is only one Lord in the universe—the Lord Jesus. As the God who created the heavens, the earth, and all the things in it, He has become a man.<p>The Creator became a God-man with the purpose that man would experience Him as grace and reality (John 1:14). The grace that God gives to man is not something materialistic. Rather, it is the Triune God Himself becoming a man called Jesus to be received by man as his enjoyment. Actually, all things are but dung; only Jesus is the top treasure. To have Jesus is to have the treasure and the grace. But this is not all. He is also the reality. Everything is vanity; all things are a striving after the wind (Eccl. 1:2-14). Only the Triune God is reality. With Him we have eternal life, which makes Him real and experiential to us.
