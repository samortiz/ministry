Not only was there a change in appearance outwardly, but even more there was a change inwardly, in the intrinsic nature
In 1986 we baptized 7,100 people within one hundred days, and about a month later we baptized more than 1,100 people, totaling over 8,200
We feared that once they were spread, they might create preconceptions which would not be easy to change afterward no matter how we tried
The training was originally meant not to be publicized, but it soon became an open matter, and everyone started to go door-knocking
Some among them joined the training and returned to be 'coaches' after the training, teaching others how to knock on doors
In one particular locality fifty saints went out and baptized more than forty people within three days, and some even set up home meetings
For this reason, we set up short-term training sessions, adopting an allocation system to assign fifty seat numbers for each locality
The first one came for the first forty days, occupying a certain seat; then the second one came, and after that the third
In this way, if there were ninety-five elders and fifty-five of those learning to be elders, all one hundred fifty could join the training
One elder who joined a two-week training session learned some secrets and practiced according to the new way when he returned
At this time, however, he baptized seventeen persons within four months and another four persons in a following month, totaling twenty-one
Leaving their hometown was not an easy thing, but it was wonderful that once they came, they did not want to leave
If these five go door-knocking five days per week, two to three hours per day, they each will baptize at least one person a week
Besides the full-timers, among the basic number of one hundred there are another twenty-five 'job-holding full-timers'
Calculating further from the first and second years, the total by the third year will be over sixteen thousand people
Using ten thousand as the base, another hundredfold increase in the three years from 1990 to 1992 will produce one million
If beginning from 1987 we all truly practice according to this new way, one hundred will become one million in six years
As such, this way is too good; in only twelve years we will be able to see the result of evangelizing the entire earth
Previously, there were approximately ten thousand saints meeting regularly in the whole of Taiwan, more than 3,500 of whom are in Taipei
If each of these gains one person every two months, that is, six a year, eighteen thousand people will be saved
If one-fourth of the fifty-four thousand calculated above each gains six in a year, there will be eighty-one thousand
Adding this number to the original fifty-four thousand and the forty thousand gained by the full-timers, the total then will be 175,000
For this, we must practically study our estimates in order to find the reliable, crucial points for our practice
According to our experience, we must practice the following points in order to have each full-timer baptize forty persons in a year
Although it sounds very easy to have one thousand people each baptizing forty in a year, it will require their labor from house to house
It is practical to expect that the one-fourth in the church who have a heart to go door-knocking once a week can gain six persons in a year
We fear that they may 'fish only for three days and dry their nets for two days,' eventually becoming unfruitful
The one-fourth in the church who have the heart will continue to increase in number; therefore, they will need much perfecting
In John 15:16 the Lord Jesus first said, 'You should go forth and bear fruit'; after this He said, 'That your fruit should remain'
Because of this, one hundred may be delivered, but only five survive; the remaining ninety-five die prematurely
Those who saw him lying in the incubator had to exercise their faith because they did not know how he could grow up
Of course, we long for more births, yet if we do not nourish and teach those who are baptized, they will die prematurely
We can summarize the need in the home meetings in four crucial points, which we need to pay close attention to
In addition, organization emerges unconsciously from the old way, and once there is organization, there is control
Eventually, even though he comes to the meetings, he does not have any feeling, like a person who has been drugged
We have to realize that if we remain in this old way of meeting, after half a year we will be 'anesthetized' and unable to wake up
How can a brother be an elder for a long time, not bring one person to the Lord, and still not have any sensation about it?
The new ones may not know how to meet the first time we go, so we have to teach them how to have a home meeting
We should let them know that a meeting is simply a matter of these things, which should not be carried out by the so-called responsible ones
When others arrive and hear the children singing they will spontaneously join them and the father and mother will also follow in the singing
Perhaps, no one sings or prays after the meal, but someone reads Genesis 1:1: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
There is no need for someone else to lead a home meeting; it is those in the home who lead the meeting themselves
The father may say Children select a hymn or the children may not wait for the father but will start singing Since Jesus came into my heart
We have to lead them to meet to break bread, but we must continue to study how to bring them to the other meetings
Question: When we go to the home meetings, we are all prepared, having prayed and come into the meeting in the spirit
According to the spirit' is easy to say, but the phrase according to still indicates a way; this requires us to spend more time to study
We will assume that the number of those meeting in the churches in Taipei and in the whole of Taiwan is ten thousand
In principle every church should produce one fulltimer for every twenty saints meeting regularly which is five percent of the total number
Every fulltimer who goes out doorknocking every day for two to three hours is bound to see one person saved and baptized in less than a week
According to our actual church life it is not possible to go door-knocking every week for fifty-two weeks of the year
Sometimes there are trainings and certain church activities, and sometimes a person may become sick and need a few days to rest
If someone goes door-knocking two to three hours every day, and in six days he gains one person, then in one year he can gain forty people
Even this number is very conservative, but the smaller the number we use, the more accurate and realistic it can be
Out of one hundred pots in a batch there may be ten that do not pass quality control inspections due to defects or breakage
If we gain twenty thousand people from door-knocking, the actual number of those who remain will be seven thousand
Counting forty-eight weeks as one year, if each gains one person every six weeks, he will gain eight people per year
Five percent who go out daily gain twenty thousand, and twenty-five percent who go out once a week also gain twenty thousand
The remaining number of each category is seven thousand, so the two categories added together make fourteen thousand
By the end of 1987 there should be at least twenty-four thousand people, which is an increase of two hundred forty percent
Using ten thousand as the original number, after laboring for one round of three years, the total is an increase of 13
One full-timer out of every twenty people and one out of four who goes door-knocking once a week is not a high percentage
Out of the ten thousand saints there are five hundred full-timers and two thousand five hundred weekly door-knockers
The statistics for the rate of gaining people in each of the two categories is the same, each group gaining twenty thousand
If we agree with this way and do not oppose it, then the full-timers should go door-knocking two to three hours every day
In two and a half hours someone can knock on the doors of fifteen homes, and in six days he can knock on ninety homes
Lord, have You taken away all the sons of peace, just like You chased away all the fish from Peter for the whole night in John 21?
Of course, when the time for reward comes, they will get the prize first; nevertheless, the seven thousand will be the next to get the prize
In Luke 10 when the Lord Jesus was sending out the seventy disciples, He said, 'I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves'
In Taipei, we have gone door-knocking at two hundred thousand homes, which is over one-third of whole of the island
In the future we must knock on their doors again, until 1995 when all the sons of peace are found and become Christians
In the first few meetings you can use some of the subjects from Life Lessons such as prayer and reading the Bible
If they want to learn to sing more, they can obtain a set of tapes from One Hundred Selected Hymns and listen to them at home
Perhaps some hymns are difficult to understand but the more someone listens to them the more he becomes familiar with the tune and the music
If three of them go together, does it mean that they should gain three people a week in order to fulfill this count?
Besides the manpower of the two thousand five hundred saints, the five hundred full-timers can also help in taking care of these homes
They will go out five days a week and attend home meetings at least three evenings, and if necessary, five evenings
Five hundred full-timers going out for five days is the equivalent of two thousand five hundred more persons to bear this burden
If the Lord has mercy on us so that we work out our estimate, then the people on the whole of Taiwan will be saved
Consider this: Of twenty million Christians, every twenty will produce one full-timer, which makes one million full-timers
These one million should all be university graduates who are fluent in international languages, spreading out to the whole world
At that time, much manpower and material riches will be given for the gospel, and the gospel will be spread throughout the whole world
If He truly accomplishes this, then first of all the whole population of the island of the Republic of China will become Christians
If we do not conduct our home meetings well, and if there is not enough support, there will certainly be some new ones who will slip away
Knocking on doors and bringing people to salvation is to bear fruit; conducting home meetings is to have the fruit remain
When we visit people by knocking on their doors, bringing them to salvation and baptizing them, we are begetting them
If we gain thirteen thousand new ones, but eventually we lose twelve thousand, with very few who remain, the saints will be discouraged
On one hand, we bring many people to salvation, but on the other hand, we must face the issue of whether or not these people will remain
On the one hand, He has a relationship with us because He is the Creator and we are the creation; He is God and we are men
If Christ were not the Spirit, He would have no way to have an organic union with us, to be our life, and to abide in us
Such a union is not like the binding together of two pieces of dead wood or the welding of two pieces of iron or steel
For sixty years the light that God has continually granted us has been first concerning Christ and second concerning the Spirit
The One who was crucified, passed through death, resurrected, and entered into us has become the Spirit, the reality
The second verse which tells us that Christ is the Spirit is 2 Corinthians 3:17; it says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
In the summer of 1969 in the conference in Erie, Pennsylvania, we released further messages on the seven Spirits
Throughout these decades, it is hard to say how many love feasts we have held and how many messages we have given
At that time, when we finished the life-study of the New Testament, we decided to go to Taiwan to research the reasons for this
At this time the Lord is opening our eyes to show us a line that we have neglected, which is to 'go' and to meet 'from house to house'
In the past we had the rich truth, the high gospel, but the result of our going out to gain people was not satisfactory
They were so frightened that they hid among the trees and made aprons out of fig leaves, avoiding the face of God
After being born, according to the human manner He lived in the home of a poor carpenter in Nazareth for thirty years
In the same way, when we go door-knocking today, every house that we visit is a place to which the Lord wants to go
Although the Lord sent the disciples as lambs in the midst of wolves, there were sons of peace among the wolves
After He departed from the world in His ascension, He said to His disciples, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth
The Lord Jesus said to His disciples that when they entered someones house they should not say anything at first except Peace to this house
Our abiding in the Lord and going door-knocking to visit people is the Lord Jesus' seeking and saving that which is lost
It is not we who go door-knocking, but Jesus Christ who abides in us goes door-knocking in order to seek and to save that which is lost
If we do not bear fruit this proves that we have not been abiding in the Lord and that there are some problems in our organic union with Him
If we are willing to pray seriously and properly join ourselves to the Lord, immediately there will be the results
Although the flow of 'electricity' has been cut off, it will now be recovered, and our contacting people will spontaneously be effective
Frankly speaking, preaching the gospel to bring people to salvation is not as difficult as it was before; now the way is much easier
We do not have to expend all our effort to invite people to love feasts to hear the gospel, as we did in the past
If someone is untrained as a cook, he will not have the skill or the boldness to kill a chicken even if he is given the right kind of knife
If it is not easy for us to bring people to salvation, this proves that we are not truly spiritual, holy, and victorious
A young sister testified that originally she had decided to gain ten people, but eventually she gained only eight
In addition to prayer, whether or not our estimate and goal can be attained depends entirely on whether we endeavor
Their heart was not on drinking the water; it was desperate to go out to fight against the Midianites and cast them out
Taking this way will make the church holy and sanctified before the Lord, and the saints will be built up together
In the past we listened to many messages concerning being built up, but the result was still that everyone built up his own matters
We must have some good prayer before we can go out to fight the spiritual battle, asking the Lord to cleanse and to fill us
For an unbeliever to not do that which is not of the spirit means that nothing remains, because their spirit is not in function
When we who serve the Lord pray and then not do all the things that we sense are not of the spirit, what remains is all of the spirit
If we want to establish a meeting in peoples homes after they are saved they will think that we are leading them to have a Sunday service
The first thing we must do is break the heritage and tradition of holding 'services' in the way of Christianity
After we come to someone's home, we should not first arrange the chairs as if we are going to have a Sunday service
The problem of religious concepts is the reason it is better not to prematurely bring the new ones to meet in the meeting hall
We should not be like those who learn to box according to rigid rules about which punch to use first and which to use second
Gradually, we have to let them know that a meeting is not a matter of forms or rituals but a matter of following the spirit
And are cleaning up together, the little brother can pray to begin the meeting while the mother is still washing the dishes
After finishing dinner, while it is still early, someone can wash the dishes and sing, 'Since Jesus came into my heart'
If we understand home meetings to this extent, then when we go and help the home meetings, we can bring people to be delivered from religion
In the meetings, regardless of whether the new ones are reading verses, giving a testimony, or speaking something, do not correct them
If a point comes when they do not do anything, we may then lead them a little by asking, 'Should we read some verses now'?
If we help the home meeting in this way, the new ones will not think that we have come to conduct a Sunday service with them
We should simply give them an impression in a flexible way that we are going there to have fellowship with them
In truth, all human beings possess a communal nature, as the ancient Chinese used to say, 'To be human is to be communal'
To illustrate further, a piece of charcoal cannot burn by itself; if it were to burn, it would go out very quickly
Occasionally there are meetings for the whole island of Taiwan and even international conferences on a larger scale
We should always allow time for others to speak something, and we should teach them how to speak in the meetings
Before we were saved, we made many mistakes in our daily life that left some consequences which need to be dealt with
One is in Luke 19, which talks about Zaccheus, who was originally a tax collector who constantly defrauded those who paid taxes
Truth Lessons is written in a coherent and systematic way and can be considered as the essence of the basic teaching for a new believer
It has not only outlines and main points but also the content to explain the outlines and main points in a concise and clear way
When we go to the home meetings, we will always encounter the practical problems of the new ones, which we cannot ignore
In order to take care of their problems, we may not be able to use Truth Lessons step by step, lesson by lesson
We must take care that when we answer the questions of new believers, regardless of what they ask, giving simpler answers is always better
We should take this opportunity to speak a little to them to let them know that to pray is to come near to the Lord
When we quiet ourselves and pray with our spirit the spirit gains ground in us and we then become very clear about the feeling of the spirit
Before reading with them, we have to read it ourselves and understand the general idea and the main points of the chapter
If the new ones can receive some solid education in Life Lessons and Truth Lessons, they will surely be remaining fruit
Three hundred out of this number will be newly added to the church life, and one-fourth of these three hundred should be remaining fruit
Last year we baptized eight thousand people in addition to the four thousand baptized at the start of our full-time training
According to past experience, among these three thousand remaining ones there should be five or six hundred homes in which they break bread
We cannot look only at the outward situation of the number of people who are baptized and the good condition of the home meetings
Full-timers need to be produced, and one-fourth of the saints must be raised up to go door-knocking every week
Whether or not we are joined to the Lord as one spirit is spontaneously revealed in our living in several ways
Our mouths not only speak and sing the word of the Lord unceasingly, but they are also full of thanksgiving and praises
If we are released, joyful, lively, and fresh, when we go to a home meeting, we will bring with us these sweet qualities
A Japanese has the look of a Japanese; when he goes to a home meeting, he brings the Japanese culture and atmosphere with him
If a surgeon does not cleanse his hands and cover his head, he will unconsciously spread the bacteria on his body to the patient
If this kind of person goes to lead a home meeting or a church meeting, the whole meeting will be as dead and rigid as he is
Since such a one is not beside himself, he certainly cannot lead a 'crazy' meeting or perfect others to be beside themselves
The phrase in Christ is a great one, but few people have the actual experience of being in Christ in their practice
The Bible does not say that he who is joined to the Lord is one Christ with Him, but that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit
In common speech there is no such expression as being fervent in spirit; we mainly speak of emotional impulses
If a Christian is emotionally impulsive he will fail because to be emotionally impulsive is in the self the natural man and even the flesh
Before going to perfect a home meeting, we ourselves must first have a transfer from our soul-our mind, emotion, and will-into our spirit
We need to go out and labor, but we should never forget that before we go to a home, we must first have a transfer
Being proficient implies not only being experienced but also being familiar with and skilled in a certain thing
The more we read the word of the Lord, the more we will experience the Lord's word and the more proficient and skillful we will be
Such a person will have been educated for many years and saturated with the words of his learning throughout these years
Those who are not educated scold others in a certain way, while those who are educated scold others in a different way
The word of the Lord in the New Testament is of two categories: the good word, that is, the word of grace, and the word of righteousness
According to Hebrews, it refers to the word of the Lord's earthly ministry, which is recorded in the four Gospels
The word in the four Gospels is truly good, but it is only the good word, the word of grace, and is still not the word of righteousness
If a person has not graduated from college it is usually not easy for him to find a good job because his practical knowledge is not adequate
Sixty years ago we might have looked down on an electrician who digs through walls, pulls cables, and repairs wires
We need to consider practically whether it is appropriate for trainees to get married during the term of training
Just when the fire is fanned into flame, a marriage may be 'cold water' poured on us, and our morale will diminish
When many newly saved young people see the trainees serving full time while they are so young, they have the same desire within them
Today we who serve the Lord are not only volunteer soldiers but also desperate fighters who serve at the risk of our lives
If we are this kind of people, when we go to perfect a home meeting, every member of the family will be perfected
Although she loved this granddaughter, it was not easy for such an elderly person to leave the idols she worshipped
If a person is casual and muddled, laughing when he should not laugh and crying when he should not cry, he is frivolous and not soberminded
If we are dignified and of a sober mind, we will behave properly and sobermindedly, having a proper expression in every aspect
They should shake hands with a person of the same sex in one way and shake hands with a person of the opposite sex in another
If someone contacts everyone in the same way with no difference at all, he is frivolous, not discerning the actual situation
To be of a sober mind means to have self-discipline, to be self-restrained, and to have self-control in everything
We have to be weighty people who do not speak thoughtlessly, express our opinion casually, or convey our attitude lightly
We stay within our limit and measure, our manner is appropriate, and our speaking and behavior are grave and fitting
Because of the rigidity in certain areas of our former practice, the function of many saints has been annulled
Before we have this kind of understanding, it is too hasty and absolutely not appropriate to establish a bread-breaking meeting in his home
Next, if there are still unclean things in his home, such as idols or a mah-jongg table, we need to help him clear those up
It is a terrible thing to establish a meeting for breaking bread in a person's home without first dealing with these matters
After people are saved, they will spontaneously abhor unclean and sinful things because of Christ's life in them
We still must help them gradually to have the proper knowledge concerning a thorough clearance of their living
If at the beginning the number in a home is too small for bread-breaking, we can combine two to three neighboring homes for this meeting
Before breaking bread, we need to have fellowship with the new ones once or twice on the significance of bread-breaking
In 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 the Lord said, 'This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me
Shedding His blood was for redeeming us, and giving His body was for dispensing His life so that He could enter into us
For this reason before we remember the Lord and come together for this fellowship we need to examine ourselves and ask for the Lords shining
In the New Testament the apostle Paul also mentioned a number of times that he was willing to forsake his life for the saints
To risk one's life is to risk one's person with his disposition, not caring about oneself and giving oneself to others
If all are martyrs, there will be no one to do the work that needs to be done and bear the responsibilities that must be borne
Many countries have their 'suicide squads,' yet for someone to risk his life inappropriately is to bring death upon himself
If we merely say that He was God becoming flesh, it is hard for people to understand what kind of flesh He was
Rather, He had to die at the exact time the Messiah should be cut off in order to fulfill the prophecy in the Old Testament
In the Old Testament Abraham offered his son Isaac on Mount Moriah, but God prepared a ram at that time to be Isaac's substitute
If the Lord Jesus were crucified in Galilee, that would be wrong; if He were crucified in Bethlehem, that also would be incorrect
The Lord must be crucified outside the city on Calvary, the peak of Mount Moriah, so that He could fulfill the prophecy in the Old Testament
When we knock on doors, we need to see people face to face, and when we talk to them, we must observe their expressions
Often when something was not right, He turned away, acting not according to men's will but according to God's will
When people were hurried or anxious, He was not, but if He truly wanted to perform a miracle, no one could stop Him
When He calmed the wind and the sea, He only needed to rebuke them once; the wind stopped immediately, and the waves died down
Very often in our experience of the Lord we think that we are perishing and that the Lord does not take care of us
We should know this: If the Lord does not seem to take care of us, we must then have the experience of forsaking ourselves
When we knock on another one, the 'wolf' howls at us, and when we knock on a third door, the 'wolf' wants to eat us
If we are willing to deny ourselves and knock on doors unceasingly and steadfastly, many 'sons of Gehenna' will become 'sons of peace'
If brothers of this kind go to perfect home meetings, they will definitely have no success because they have not come out of themselves
If this kind of person goes to visit or perfect home meetings, there will be no impact, because he has not denied himself
If we wish to go to someone's house and perfect the home meeting there, we first need to be persons who deny ourselves
Those who prefer laughing need to learn how to weep, while those who prefer weeping need to learn how to laugh
We see from the Gospels that when people were burning, the Lord was very calm, and when people were silent, He rose up to take action
In John 11116 when Lazarus was sick and about to die his sisters Martha and Mary sent people to beg the Lord Jesus to come to them quickly
He first remained in the place where He was for two days and then told the disciples that He wanted to go and see Lazarus
The Lord Jesus was far away across the Jordan, but Lazarus lived in Judea near Jerusalem, where the Jews were planning to kill Him
When we pray, we frequently have the experience that the feeling within is leading us to counter ourselves, that is, to hate ourselves
In order to perfect a home meeting, we must counter our self, at least our unhappy self, to become a person who rejoices in the Lord
If we have read the four Gospels carefully, we will see that when the Lord Jesus worked, He went against Himself
Those who have read the Acts and the Epistles will also see that many saints, especially Paul, were also such persons
If we do not accommodate them, we will kill them, but if we do accommodate them, there must be a limit to how much we are prepared to do
For the first twenty-five minutes of a forty-minute meeting, the new ones may still be asking various kinds of questions
In the remaining fifteen minutes, we need to give them a 'shot' to inject them with the burden that we have brought with us
In this way, they can gain help regarding the breaking of bread, receive light from the truth, and receive the life supply
We need to teach our 'students' definite items in each lesson and not be ambivalent, considering that it does not matter what we do
Because among us the truth is rich and the supply of life is readily available, we do not lack the proper materials
Since we now have fifteen thousand people who are newly baptized, there may not be enough manpower to take care of each family
In it there will be some correspondence, some life supply, some unveiling of the truth, a word concerning the gospel, and so on
Undoubtedly, the church's meetings include big meetings and medium-sized meetings, but the basic meeting place is the home
We believe that this home was only one of many that was very close to Peter, a home that cared for Peter very much
Of course, having definite dates and set times is more convenient for the sake of scheduling our daily living and activities
The revelation of the Bible is that the meetings of the church are not religious; rather, they are the activity of the Body
The church meetings are not basically in the big meetings or in the meeting halls but in the homes of the saints
As we all know, the purpose of any religion is to have an object of worship and to teach according to that object
Due to man's desire to worship God, he feels the need for a place of gathering in which one man speaks and all the others listen
For a person to come every time is an honor to the meeting, and for him to make a material offering is excellent
Today's Christianity, including Catholicism, Protestantism, every sect, and every denomination, is in such a condition
If the flower is always kept inside the house, its leaves will turn yellow; then it will need to be placed outside
We are laboring here in an earnest way while certain ones are laughing behind our backs and saying that we are bringing trouble on ourselves
Even though Protestantism preached the gospel and taught the truth, the Lord was able to gain very little from that in actuality
It is not necessary to speak of the outward situation in religion; even among us in the Lord's recovery there is not much treasure
Generally speaking, all these things have a set time, but in reality children also have urgent needs that must be taken care of
According to the principle, we have not wanted these newly baptized ones to come to our existing meetings right away
If a new mother, who has never raised any children before and has had no experience, receives this teaching, her child may suffer
When his diaper is wet she will not change it because she is strictly following the teaching to not change diapers until the prescribed time
The Old Testament does not expressly and clearly speak about the church, but it does have many types and prophecies concerning the church
As far as we know, there are already one hundred fifty homes among us beginning to have the Lord's table meeting
In meeting the needs, we need to be adaptable and flexible, just as a coach teaches people how to play basketball
When the leaders of ancient Greek cities wanted to gather together all the people in the city, they would call them out
The English usage of the word church may also be inaccurate, because most people consider the church as a chapel
Though the word assembly is very good, its meaning in the English language is not as rich as that in the Greek language
It is only when we organize this pile of wood piece by piece that it is an organization, such as a table or a bookshelf
If we have this light and see the church according to this light, we will realize that the church cannot be found in Christianity
Jewish and ancient Greek constructions began with a base pillars were built on top of it and then the rest of the building continued upward
To God, the church has this kind of function to bear all that God is as the reality, the truth, of the universe
The word reality is better than truth in conveying the proper meaning, because truth can be misunderstood as doctrines
If this mystery refers only to Christ, then Christ's being taken up in glory should precede His being preached among the nations
After that we learn multiplication and division, and we may find memorizing the multiplication table to be even harder
At the time we are learning all these things we do not thoroughly understand them but through more learning we gradually come to understand
The one seen in the United States is the moon in the United States, and the one seen in Taiwan is the moon in Taiwan
The one situated in Hong Kong is the church in Hong Kong, and the one positioned in London is the church in London
Question: Since the church can have a designation, when the meeting hall needs to put up a sign, how should we designate it?
Going door-knocking, visiting people, leading people to believe in the Lord and be saved, and baptizing them are only the basic matters
After a person is saved, establishing a meeting in his home, leading people in the meeting, and perfecting the meeting are the key matters
All of us, older ones and younger ones, need to understand this burden, receive this burden, and bear this burden in one accord
Along with the Reformation, the invention of printing and the use of newspapers brought a noticeable benefit for Christianity
In the 1800s, three hundred years after the Reformation at the time of Luther, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England
The United States has many seminaries, but today two in particular are considered as leaders in terms of theological teaching
Around 1900 the Scofield Reference Bible was very popular in the United States, and even today many people are still using it
More than ninety-five percent of the footnotes in this reference Bible originate from the theology and teachings of the Brethren
Before the Brethren were raised up, Christians in America and Europe generally believed that their chapels were the church
Throughout the previous generations not one group of Christians had supplied a better interpretation of the types than the Brethren did
Before the emergence of the Brethren, people in general were not clear about the second coming of the Lord Jesus
People were not clear about the Lord Jesus' coming, nor did they fully understand the interpretation of the other prophecies in the Bible
It was the Brethren who opened up the book of Daniel, and they also opened up Revelation, at least on the surface
Only a portion of the true lovers and seekers of the Lord have accepted the teachings of the Brethren in the past one hundred sixty years
When we go to lead and perfect a home meeting, we may not even know what kind of truth materials we have and how to use them
There are at least three to four kinds of materials for the edification of the new believers, but we need to decide which one to use
Speaking too profoundly may be unacceptable, but speaking too shallowly is not good, and speaking nothing is even worse
The Bible cannot be changed; however, the way to interpret the Bible and use the Bible requires much consideration
Although they still met in the synagogue, they may not have done it willingly, and there was no record of what they did there
If we were still using an ox cart to travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung, it would take at least two days to get there
In the past sixty years we have inherited and have been following the old way for too long and to too great an extent
To continue to conduct our meetings and preach the gospel according to the old way would be like going back to the ox cart
They consider that taking the train is too troublesome; they say they are too limited by time and might miss the train
The ox cart, they say, is much more flexible; it is always available and can go and stop anywhere as one wishes
We do not mean that the old way has no advantage at all, but when we compare the two ways, it is clear to us which way we should take
Before we go to lead a home meeting, we should have adequate prayer so that we will be bold in the release of the spirit
The coach first needs to teach them the basic movements, expecting that they would practice these basic matters thoroughly
They need only to apply them with flexibility according to the real situation with the goal of shooting the ball into the basket
If there is a need to explain the Greek text, we can simply mention that the word church in Greek means the 'called-out assembly'
Later the Lord raised up the churches in the Lord's recovery as a testimony that denominations are a party formed into a sect
Since we 'blew the trumpet' concerning sects, mainland China has been affected, and it is still affected to this today
Some preferred Paul so they were of Paul some preferred Cephas so they were of Cephas and some preferred Apollos so they were of Apollos
Still others said that those were wrong and that Christ was best, so they were 'of' Christ; eventually four groups were formed
We all know that baptism is in the Bible, but to make it a special designation, that is, to make it a special creed, is not of the Bible
If someone has already been baptized and wants to attend the meetings in the Baptist Church, he will have to be baptized again by them
Some Christians were baptized not by immersion but by sprinkling and some even passed through the flagwaving ceremony of the Salvation Army
Like us, they also hold the common faith of the Triune God, the redemptive death of the Lord Jesus, and His resurrection and ascension
In accordance with their special creed, the Baptist Church, for example, has a certain fellowship among themselves
The situation in today's Christianity is mainly due to these three matters-special creeds, special fellowships, and special names
We should lead them to read the Bible to see that division is fleshy and condemned by God and that we should reject it completely
We also have to teach them that any group that has a special creed, special fellowship, or special name is a sect
According to our study and observation, we feel that we still need to prepare a set of materials for the perfecting of the home meetings
Apparently, to be a witness does not have much to do with life, but in actuality to be a witness is to bear witness for life
At that time the disciples were in a room with closed doors and windows, yet He entered with a resurrected body
From its beginning the Gospel of John tells us that the Lord Jesus is God He is the Word of God and He became flesh and lived on this earth
We can say that He is a man, but He has a body not of the old creation but of the new creation and of resurrection
In Acts 1, the disciples who personally observed the Lord's death and resurrection immediately became witnesses of the Lord
By this we see that the Lord Jesus wanted the disciples to go out not to do a work but to be a certain kind of person
To be a witness is not to go to court to testify of things you have seen and heard or to give details of a particular story
Rather, to be a witness means that the person for whom you are witnessing has become you, and you have become Him
To experience genuine death and resurrection means that a person lives not by himself but by putting himself aside
The Lord Himself always stood in death, and once He stood in death, the Father was able to live out from within Him
Paul said that we who serve the Lord die daily so that we may no longer live to ourselves but to Him who died for us and has been raised
If this continues, we will all become like robots, moving when the machinery moves and not moving when it stops
If we have such an attitude, such a spirit, such a life, and such a faith, we will live a life that is always dependent on Him
Today as we are serving the Lord, we must exercise to the extent that our going is the Lord's going, and our move is the Lord's move
Although our body acts, visits people, goes door-knocking, and baptizes people, our spirit is joined to the Lord as one spirit
Sometimes we think that we should do something in a certain way, but the spirit within us directs us in a different way
At the same time, we need to explain to them the significance of water in baptism so that they can understand its meaning
We should believe that when we are serious, our words will certainly be of the spirit, having reality and power to impress people
We must exercise our spirit and learn to speak in the spirit, telling people, 'Dear friends, this is a great matter
We do not necessarily need to resolve matters such as smoking and drinking right away, because both smoking and drinking are a kind of habit
Even if we have been serving the Lord with our full time for a long time, our practice related to the Spirit and the word is still lacking
Although the church has been on the earth for over two thousand years, it has borne little testimony for the Lord
They are civilized or uncivilized, well-educated or uneducated, capable or incapable, but none of them is without opinions
Not only our own efforts but even the efforts of all those who have been serving us in the church will be brought to naught
To our shame, however, there have not been much multiplication and increase among us over the past sixty years
It was a pity, however, that some among us were seeking after so-called 'spirituality,' which produced many opinions
Eventually, these ones invited a well-known evangelist from abroad, whose arrival brought even more opinions into the church
According to his opinion, he wanted to establish his own ministry in order to gain a group of people through the messages he released
From that time on, the one accord among the churches in Taiwan was never recovered to what it used to be before 1954
Doctors know that once damage has been done to the body, it is very difficult to recover it to its original condition
During the years between 1949 and 1954, all of us were of one heart and one mouth, sharing the same burden and the same goal
At that time, we did not hear any opinions, whether we were at a co-workers' meeting, church meeting, or training meeting
Around 1960, though, this turmoil was stirred up by that particular opinion with the result of inflicting great damage on our spirit
Not a single message was empty or meaningless; all the messages were full of the light of life and the supply of life
At that time the Lord's recovery spread across the whole of America, from the east to the west and from the north to the south
There were some brothers who were regarded as proper, honest, and without guile, and they had some thorough fellowship with us
They overemphasized the correct time for breaking the bread, and they stressed the 'universality' of the breaking of bread
If we hold on to our opinions, the training will be a waste of effort; the opinions and the effort will offset one other
The truth that we speak and the instructions that we give have all undergone a long period of research and study
In the latter part of the book of Acts from chapters thirteen to twentyeight Paul was in the lead and again we mostly do not find opinions
When they heard that Paul had taught people throughout the nations not to keep the law of Moses, they were deeply troubled
If someone receives this leading, he is in the Lord's recovery, and if he does not receive it, he is still in the Lord's recovery
Experience tells us that things often start off well, but gradually as opinions creep in, the situation changes
We often describe a certain person as being 'barbaric' to indicate that his character has not been properly trained
Many in Christianity often think that the prevailing of the Lord's work in the age of the apostles was due to the power of the Holy Spirit
We cannot find a verse in Acts saying that the power of the Holy Spirit resulted in an increase in the number of people in the church
The problem in Christianity is with opinions, and the poverty in Christianity is due to the lack of the word of God
Even among those who have the proper interpretation of the word in the Bible, what is spoken is often shallow and superficial
Many have not seen the profound truth and revelation of God and the eternal economy of God that are revealed in the Bible
To have only the word of the Lord without the Spirit is like having the outward shell of a body without the inward content of life
In this way, when we go out to perfect a home meeting, it will not matter much whether or not we have prepared any materials
We need to have the word as the reality and content in order to supply life to others and cause them to grow in life
If we lack these two items, no matter how good our materials and methods are, we will be giving others only doctrines and letters
We should bear in mind that it is the Spirit of God and the word of God that can enliven others and cause them to grow
Through our experience, we eventually realize that the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word; the two are simply one
What the Lord Jesus speaks to us is His word, but when this word enters into our being, it becomes spirit and life
When the spirit comes from them, it becomes word, and when this word enters into others, it again becomes spirit
We all know that whatever food we consumewhether it is milk bread meat vegetables or fruitis able to supply us life and cause us to grow
That is why a small child who weighs only a few pounds at birth will weigh over a hundred pounds after a number of years
In Life Lessons, which was compiled for the perfecting of the home meetings, a suitable hymn is included in each lesson
To maintain a proper rhyme, the long lines have to rhyme with the long ones and the short lines with the short
What mercy that my eyes have seen' is four groups of two syllables, and the sentence ends with another three syllables
Although the first three lines are composed of eight syllables, in Chinese they all are in the pattern of three and five, not four and four
If you are the one out of every four saints who is willing to go doorknocking and visiting you should consecrate the Lords Day to the Lord
The first evening is to be trained in how to knock on doors, lead a home meeting, and use and teach from Life Lessons
One and a half evenings should be devoted to leading home meetings, and the remaining half evening should be used for door-knocking
You should not stop begetting; you should continue to beget, but you should raise up the ones whom you have begotten
If everyone has something to say, and if everyone has his opinions, it will never be possible to 'get to Rome'
The one with the steering wheel in his hands is the one who drives, and everyone else in the car should not talk
Even if we know that the directions are not quite right, the 'steering wheel' is not in our hands, so we should still remain silent
Those who work faithfully will drive there right away and arrive in ten minutes, or twenty minutes at the most
From the beginning the many young fulltime serving ones among us need to learn the lesson of having no opinions and not giving any opinions
If there are children in the homes, we need to encourage them to sing with us because children are the fastest learners of hymns
Although Life Lessons has its own sequence of lessons, we do not need to be rigid about the sequence when we use the book
The principle is that the choice should be based on our knowledge of the particular home and their practical needs
Because it is simple, it is easy for the new ones to understand, but it still has a crucial meaning and certain main points
We not only need to study the verses thoroughly, but we also need to understand the main points in the explanation
If five or six people are together talking and laughing excitedly and someone comes in weeping they will hardly be able to continue laughing
If we walk according to the truth and the Spirit in our daily life, as time goes by we will be a certain kind of person
We not only seek the constant filling of the Holy Spirit, but we also need to have a good training of our character
We all need to learn to be proper people, not only when we visit others in their home but also in our daily life
We must continually build up our character in our daily living and seek to always be filled by the Holy Spirit
If the home meetings are good, the new way will succeed, but if the home meetings are not good, the new way will fail
It is difficult for the trainees to live with several hundred people, let alone be trained twenty-four hours a day
Perhaps some of them are the only son or daughter at home, and they were spoiled by their parents and allowed to do whatever they liked
Every person who serves the Lord must be like an egg of marble, even of steel that can withstand a nuclear attack
If we hear a word that wrongs us or does not please us and become hurt and disappointed, then we will not be welcome anywhere
If the arrangement is that we share a room with another person, even with two or three people, we are still fine
It is not even necessary to bring up other Bible verses because all the necessary verses are contained in the lesson
By leading the new ones to read and speak in this way, it will be easy for them to remember the five main aspects of the church
The speaking of twenty minutes has its benefits the speaking of fifty minutes has its benefits and the speaking of one hour has its benefits
In the coming years, we hope that there will be more than one hundred thousand saints meeting regularly in Taipei
Whether or not the new way will be successful is a matter of God's eternal purpose, and it depends on whether or not we are willing to do it
The problem today lies not with the way but with whether or not we are willing to take this way and how we take it
When they go back to their own localities, they should spread the new way and become teachers to train the saints in every place
In a few years hundreds and thousands, even tens of thousands, of saints in Taiwan will go to many places to gospelize the world
We all must press forward to succeed in the home meetings, to gospelize Taiwan, and to gospelize the whole world
Even though some of the hymns were selected from outside sources, none of them were simply copied exactly or compiled without being revised
Some originally were old English hymns that were spread to China one or two hundred years ago and translated into Chinese
He also said that there were other sheep which were not of this fold; He would lead them both and they would become one flock
The Lord Jesus leads people out from the fold, but the hymn writers have opened the fold wide again and called the sheep back in
One of these hymns is based on the historical fact of the Israelites' crossing the Jordan River and entering into the land of Canaan
Redemption was accomplished on the cross, while salvation is the application of the redemption of the cross to us
Redemption is objective and was accomplished on the cross, whereas salvation is subjective and is applicable to us
We need to see that Christ not only was cursed, but He actually became a curse on our behalf to redeem us out of the curse of the law
The Old Testament also prophesied that crucifixion was not an ordinary punishment or execution but an extraordinary one
In Deuteronomy the ordinance of the law which God established with man explicitly speaks of a man being cursed by hanging on a tree
As a result, the words in that ordinance became a prophecy, prophesying that Christ would hang on a tree, that is, be crucified on the cross
Christ was crucified beginning at nine oclock in the morning Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour
From nine o'clock to noon was one period of time, and from noon to three o'clock in the afternoon was another period
Christ was crucified for a total of six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the afternoon
In the first three hours, it was men who persecuted Him; it was not yet God who punished Him on behalf of us sinners
Of the same period of punishment on the cross, the first half was in martyrdom, while the second half was in redemption
1 Peter 224 says Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree in order that we having died to sins might live to righteousness
The first thing Christ accomplished on the cross was to bear the various sins in our outward behavior, that is, our 'personal sins'
On the cross the second thing that Christ did was to remove the sin in our inward nature, that is, the sin inherited by birth
Galatians 3:13 says, 'Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because
Those who smoke opium cannot quit no matter how hard they try because there is an addiction within their bodies
On the cross Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death, and released us from the slavery of death
Eleventh, John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit '
The first ten items kill and abolish, while the last item releases life and dispenses life into us so that we can be His living members
We should introduce new ones or family members among us in a normal and informal way for everyone to become acquainted with each other
When we go to a new ones home whether there are few or many men or women old or young we should not be afraid and certainly not be cowardly
For those who are more seeking, we can give them more, perhaps two lessons every week or two meetings a week with two lessons each time
If we do not adequately feed those who are earnestly seeking and have a large capacity, they may become uneasy
Since Life Lessons and the home meetings are closely related, we need to have a basic knowledge of Life Lessons
We have observed in certain students in the seminaries that the more they read the Bible, the more deadened they become
In John 5:39-40 the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, 'You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life
As a result he may go to check with the dictionary and discover that in Chinese there is only in the ancient times and not in the beginning
We may use another example in which a person reads Genesis 1:1: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
We need to understand the literal meaning of this sentence-'in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'-by using our mind
When we read the Bible, we read with our eyes, then comprehend with our mind, and then receive what we read with our spirit
Reading with the eyes, comprehending with the mind, and receiving with the spirit are the three steps of reading the Bible
The ones who read in this way do not seem to have a spirit, or their spirit seems to be dead, so they rely entirely on their mind
When we read, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,' we can say to the Lord, 'O Lord, in the beginning!
It is remarkable that the more a person calls on an idol or George Washington, the less of a joyful feeling he has
If pray-reading is entirely a matter of mental response, a person can also try to pray-read the newspaper and see what happens
It is not necessary to continually command ourselves to move our legs; as long as we walk, we are moving our legs
Even if we speak to the Lord gently from within, 'O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,' our spirit will be activated
The Bible verses in Life Lessons may not be quoted in their entirety but only in part, economically according to the need
The verses are quoted concisely, not too much or too little, and adequately, being most suitable for the new believers
We should lead them to the point where we can sense that the inner condition of the few saved ones in this home is stable before the Lord
Depending on the situation, the serving ones can decide how to hand over the offerings each week to the meeting hall where they meet
The brothers and sisters who meet regularly in the homes may have been accustomed to meeting corporately in the meeting hall
Now that some of these brothers and sisters attend the home meetings, the arrangement for their children will become a problem
If certain home meetings are located near each other, the children can be grouped together to be cared for in one home
To do something in particular may not be necessary at the beginning, but gradually we have to bring them into the knowledge of the church
Both the newly saved ones and those who have been saved for a long time will blend together in the meeting and be mutually encouraged
Still, we need to bear in mind that this is not a set regulation but is something entirely organic and flexible
If some brothers and sisters are newly baptized and are meeting in a few homes, they should remain in their home meetings for a month or two
By the time the number in their district increases to thirty forty fifty or sixty we can lead them to set up a corporate district meeting
After three to four weeks we can bring these brothers and sisters to the meeting hall to attend the Lord's table meeting on the Lord's Day
In the future there will be people here in Taipei attending different kinds of meetings on the same Lord's Day
As we all realize, if we take the old way, we will be bound in fetters and confined, and there will be no way out
For this reason, it is often a help not to bring our Bibles, hymnals, and tracts with us when we go to the home meetings
Once the customer finds out that there are more products, he will want to see them all, even if there are hundreds of them
The chapter we read may be about calling upon the name of the Lord, but we will be tempted to read Genesis 1 about God's creation
Not many people were baptized through our speaking of those stories and the testimonies quoted from classical writings
Our weapon for preaching the gospel is The Mystery of Human Life, and the one for leading the home meetings is Life Lessons
If we come to a point we do not understand, we simply need to repeat-read, emphasize-read, vitalize-read, and pray-read
We need to impart these words into people: 'in the beginning,' 'God,' 'created,' 'the heavens,' and 'the earth'
If we first impart the verses into people, they will receive the supply, because the Word of the Lord is living and powerful
Although we cannot say that every word in the footnotes is a gold nugget, each word is at least concise, to-the-point, and pertinent
If we read a certain chapter, we should simply read that chapter and not make references to other books or materials
The first is to go door-knocking by using The Mystery of Human Life, and the second is to have home meetings by using Life Lessons
Days a week from the morning until night we should either knock on doors and baptize people or have home meetings to nourish and supply them
We have estimated that if we gain two thousand people through door-knocking, about one-fourth will remain, which is five hundred people
We never thought that the word spoken by the Lord in Matthew 13 and the principle of our estimation under His leading would be the same
The anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches utterly choked the word, causing it to become unfruitful
Among these five hundred new ones who attend the meetings, we can produce one hundred twenty-five who will knock on doors
It was he who brought Paul into the New Testament ministry, and it was also he who brought Paul with him to go out to work
Even among these five thousand there may be over three thousand who are weak, but there are still over one thousand who are stable
While we are taking this way, we should not look only at the dark side; we should also look at the bright side
We may go out again for a second night, and still no one may be baptized, and on the third night only two are baptized
If we firmly believe this way and are faithful in taking it, after not too long the whole earth will be filled with our brothers and sisters
He can cause us not to be able to gain people today and tomorrow, sending away all the sons of peace and giving us only wolves
The work we are doing is a work of peace, the people we are seeking are the sons of peace, and the way we are taking is a way of peace
If we go, we will certainly give others an impression of emptiness and deadness, and this is what we must not do
If all of us still meet according to this old way, we too may eventually give up the meetings because we do not have the spirit and life
For the time being, we may agree to this saying, but even in a playground you still have to have a ball to play with
What the coach fears most is that the ball, the court, the opponents, and everything else are ready, but the players cannot play well
The second reason that the small group meetings are not successful is that we do not know how to use the spiritual materials
People think that if they want to eat chicken, fish, vegetables, or rice, all they have to do is bring them home
All of us fulltimers have to be clear that we are engaged in this profession to do two things to go doorknocking and to lead home meetings
The advantage is that although they do not like it, they will admire our spirit and feel grateful for our love toward them
When we go a third and fourth time, he may open the door and also his heart, but he still will not be baptized
Some of them are 'sheep'; it is just that they have been influenced by the atmosphere of society and have put on a wolf's skin
Especially in the villages if we practice doorknocking in the way that we are doing now we may be able to knock on all the doors in one day
The first lesson of the second volume is 'Knowing the Sects,' and the last lesson is 'The Offering of Material Riches'
The first volume talks about knowing that you are saved, having the life of the Lord, knowing the church, and living a life in the church
Being transferred into Christ is being saved, while being raptured to meet the Lord is the end of our journey of following the Lord
In other words, all four volumes of Life Lessons range from knowing that we are saved to the obtaining of glory
These forty-eight chapters clearly tell Christians all the matters from their being saved to entering into glory
University professors have their own way of teaching, which is different from the way the elementary teachers teach
Today they are still receiving training here, but the content of this training is not chemistry, science, astronomy, geography, or history
Many things we know without having learned them, but other things we may have been taught for over a year without knowing them
We will be so familiar with the content that when we go to the home meeting, we will not necessarily need to start with the first lesson
Although there are many points concerning leading the new ones, it is not necessary to practice them all immediately
If the situation manifests the need for a certain kind of leading, and such a leading is possible, we can carry it out
On the other hand, we may feel that the new ones in this home meeting can be brought to a big meeting of the church
We hope that when we bring them to the meeting in the meeting hall we will bring at least twenty homes with about sixty brothers and sisters
Before bringing them to the meeting, we first should train them by telling them, 'Today we are going to see the big meeting in the church
The brothers should consider these two thousand homes carefully and find out to which meeting halls and districts these homes belong
In the future these results will be given to the brothers and sisters in every meeting hall who will lead the homes
When we first knock on the door of a home, the person there may open the door to us, but he may wear a cold face
Frankincense is a kind of fragrance, but natural affection is honey in the meal offering, which God does not want
Some have said that no matter how much they knocked on doors, the doors would not open, or even if the doors were open, the hearts were not
They report that the many doors they knocked on were all open, or that a new home has been brought into baptism and is having meetings
From the results of our study, we have found that the brothers and sisters 'at the poles' went out to knock on doors with a cold face
If it is hard for someone to be 'heated up,' he needs to move from the 'poles' to the 'equator' to be warmed up by the hot air
When we go out to work, whether it is door-knocking or visiting homes, we need to heat people up but not make them too hot
Making people feel too close to us is not appropriate, because when this kind of feeling comes, natural affection also follows
We can have a feeling of love for others-we can even go on a picnic together-but in whatever we do, there must be a limit
Life Lessons volumes one and two contain a total of eighteen topics, ten in volume one and eight in volume two
The first three 'knowings' are concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; the other two are regarding the cross and the church
The line of thought here is that by knowing the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and adding the cross, we have the church
Life Lessons helps a new believer first to know that he himself is saved and second to see the need for his whole family to be saved
It helps him to begin to know the true God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and also the cross of Christ, and even to know the church
Do not wait until you go to take care of a home meeting to start reading the lessons and decide which topic is suitable
If a professor is still flipping through his books when he stands in front of the blackboard, he should be dismissed
At the same time, the new ones have probably touched the Lord's love in the meetings and are willing to consecrate themselves to the Lord
After consecrating themselves to the Lord, they will wish to do something for the Lord, so they must exercise their spirit
The apostle Paul testified for them that before offering their material riches, they had already let the Lord gain them
They first subjected themselves to the Lord, and not only to the Lord, but also to the apostles who took the lead to serve the Lord
Once a person is filled with the Holy Spirit, three things will result: preaching the gospel, serving the Lord, and offering material riches
Consecrating ourselves comes out of the Lord's love to us, while offering material riches comes out of the filling of the Holy Spirit
Consecrating ourselves comes out of the Lord's love to us, while offering material riches comes out of the filling of the Spirit in us
A contemporary Chinese scholar, Hu Shih, said that the Chinese Union Version is a great advancement in Chinese vernacular literature
The literary style of Ephesians is also very good, although from the viewpoint of the original meaning it was translated relatively poorly
We have already fellowshipped that full-timers, especially the younger generation, should do only two things full time
We have learned that even though we need to spend time exercising, we should do it absolutely not for entertainment but for health
In addition to the normal eight hours for working, the four to five hours remaining should be time for studying
According to the old Chinese learning method, however, children recite books from the first day they go to school
They recite from The Three-character Classics, The Book of Family Names, and The Analects of Confucius every day
We must work so thoroughly on the text that we are able to speak it fluently and the content of the lessons becomes our inward constitution
If we study these four volumes well before we go to labor on the home meetings, our viewpoint will be completely different
If this is the case, we can surely saturate Taipei so that in every home there is a meeting which is new and living
If the players rigidly follow only what their coach has taught them about passing and catching the ball, they will certainly lose the game
Similarly, parents should teach their children when they are young so that what has been taught can be wrought into their 'blood'
From now on, the way the church should take is to knock on doors, lead people to be baptized, and set up home meetings
If we are all proper and we spread throughout the different classes of society, the impact will be immeasurable
We estimate that although there are only forty-eight lessons, it takes one and a half years to complete this course
If we multiply in this way, the people we gain will not be indifferent or like the 'church members' in Christianity
Once they open, they cannot get rid of us, and eventually we even baptize them in water, which is difficult for them to understand
What we are bringing to their home is a 'diamond,' and they feel it would be a pity if they did not receive it
That is why they may show us a long face when we first come, but after talking with us for five minutes, their face relaxes
It is like someone who grinds in a mill; first he pushes the grindstone in one direction, and then he pushes it in the other
Man's feelings are like the weather; if the weather is not good, after a couple of days it will be sunny again
We who serve the Lord should have a long-term view, because there will be a time when people come to the end of their life
We need to be encouraged by this good prospect that there will be Christians everywhere meeting in different homes
Today the good schools throughout the world take note of the talented students and put them in separate classes
We must observe people's inward condition of pursuing, fulfill their desire for pursuing, and add suitable meetings for them
According to the normal thought and social custom, they suppose that after being baptized they should go to a 'church' for a Sunday service
Otherwise, once they go to the denominations and join their meetings, they will feel that they have what they were looking for
When we go to the meeting hall, we also need to follow the Spirit's leading to release our spirit to praise and pray
For the preaching of the gospel we use The Mystery of Human Life, and for establishing the home meetings we use Life Lessons
Today when people are saved they have the thought that they have received a religion so they will wish to know how this religion originated
Although he listens to what we speak, he may not understand due to our unclear explanation, and he may not come anymore
If they ask about certain practical matters, we should sit down and spend ten or twenty minutes to clearly explain the matters to them
Many times people may not have specific questions, but we should still learn to lead them to the spiritual points
Our following the Lord and serving Him focuses not on the outward things but on following the spirit within us
The outbreak of wars, the situation in the world, and the budget for national defense are also included in economics
Once he speaks, even if he speaks only one word, we can know his inward condition so as to meet his inward needs
Even though we may be teaching the same curriculum, we may use one method to teach one type of person and another method for another person
When we go out to labor on home meetings, we are fanning the fire into flame, and we do not fear that it will be too fierce
Although this lesson does not specifically mention each aspect of salvation, it includes the first stage of sanctification
The content of Life Lessons is deeper from one volume to the next, but this does not mean that there is nothing profound in the first volume
The incarnation of Christ was a work His crucifixion was a work His resurrection from the dead was a work and His ascension was also a work
The second lesson on knowing Christ begins with His ascension to the heavens and continues with His heavenly ministry
Because this lesson is so profound and high, we must be particularly careful in using it when we go to the home meetings
He not only ensures that the new covenant will not fail, but He also executes this new covenant upon those who believe in Him
If someone continues to raise questions and refuses to let us go, we should treasure such a heart and repeat the lesson once again
If they do not let us go, we should be happy for their pursuing heart, and we should read again to get into the words with them
We need to realize that most of the newly baptized ones have been saved within the past few months and that they do not know much
We should teach the first two volumes to lay a foundation in them before starting to use the topics in the next two volumes
We should avoid trying to teach them the content of volumes three and four at the beginning, because they have not yet reached that level
It is by the Holy Spirit's enlightening and searching within man in such a way that a sinner is awakened to repent
