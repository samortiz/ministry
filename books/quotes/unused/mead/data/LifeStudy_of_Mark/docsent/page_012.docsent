   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BAPTISM OF REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As one who signified the termination of the old dispensation with the old culture and religion, John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Repentance is to change the mind, turning it to the Slave-Savior, and baptism is to bury the repenting people, terminating them, for the Slave-Savior to germinate them by regeneration John 3:3, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word rendered for in this verse also means unto.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Repentance with baptism is for, and results in, forgiveness of sins so that the obstacle of man s fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his preaching John the Baptist emphasized repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To repent is to turn our mind from anything other than God, including our culture, religion, knowledge, education, and social life, and turn it to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Religion, culture, civilization, society, knowledge, and education all distract us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now that the old dispensation has been terminated, we must repent and turn our mind to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the Gospel of Mark, John the Baptist did not teach the repentant ones what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, he simply buried them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This burial signifies termination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the wilderness John preached repentance and terminated all those who repented.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is included as part of the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mark 1:1 speaks of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus Christ denotes the Lord s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel is of a Man named Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mark 1:1 does not say, Jesus Christ and the Son of God ; it says, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The comma here indicates that Son of God is in apposition to Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that the Son of God denotes Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The title the Son of God denotes the Lord s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the fact that the gospel is of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, means that it is of humanity and deity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This gospel is full of humanity and also full of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This compound title used in relation to the gospel reveals that both human virtues and divine attributes are in this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This gospel is full of the Lord s humanity in its virtue and perfection and also full of His deity in its glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the gospel is of humanity full of virtue and perfection and of deity full of glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these aspects can be seen in the sixteen chapters of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A LANDMARK</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we read 1:1 and 2 carefully, we shall see that the beginning of the gospel was the coming of John the Baptist to preach the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When John came out in an uncultured and unreligious way announcing repentance, that was the beginning of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we have seen, the beginning of the gospel involves the termination of the dispensation of law and the germination of the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The dispensation of law ended with the coming of John the Baptist, and the dispensation of grace began also with him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among theologians there has been a debate about the beginning of the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some say that this dispensation began at the day of Pentecost, and others claim that it began with the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others hold still different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, the beginning of the gospel, which is the beginning of the dispensation of grace, was the coming out of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the coming of John the Baptist was a landmark dividing the dispensation of law and the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His coming marked the end of the dispensation of law and the beginning of the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE WAY AND THE PATHS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mark 1:2 indicates that John the Baptist came to prepare the Lord s way, and verse 3 says, A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In these verses we have the way and the paths.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To make ready the way of the Lord is to change the mind of the people; it is to turn their mind toward the Slave-Savior and make their heart right, straightening every part of their heart through repentance so that the Slave-Savior may enter into them to be their life and take possession of them Luke 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to understand the difference between the way and the paths.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To prepare the way of the Lord is to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have seen that to repent is to change our mind, to have a turn in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To turn our mind is to prepare the way for the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way in verse 3 refers to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to prepare the way, make ready the way, of the Lord through repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John the Baptist did an excellent job of preparing the mind of the repentant ones for the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The paths are all the minor, inner sections of our being: thoughts, likes and dislikes, intentions, desires, decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we compare the mind to a highway, we may compare the paths to small streets and roads.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The highway and all the streets in our being need to be prepared for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As human beings we are not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, inwardly we are very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Consider how many streets and lanes we have within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consider also how people s minds are away from God and occupied with things of philosophy and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How is it possible, then, for Christ to come into people?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order for Christ to enter into a person, the way and the paths within him need to be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The gospel is not merely an objective matter, for the gospel is actually Jesus Christ Himself as the embodiment of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As such a One, He is waiting for people to open to Him so that He may come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, people have their minds occupied and filled with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the best evangelist is one who can cut the way in a person s mind and thereby prepare him to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we preach the gospel properly, eventually the way will be prepared for Christ to come into people and occupy them.</S>
