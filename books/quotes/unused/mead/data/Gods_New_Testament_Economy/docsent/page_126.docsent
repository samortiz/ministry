   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENTERABLE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to specifically look at the triune entry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the divine revelation in the sixty-six books of the Bible our God is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That God is righteous, holy, merciful, and faithful has been preached and taught for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must also realize, though, that the righteous, holy, merciful, faithful God is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Noah s ark is a type of our God being enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ark typifies Christ, the embodiment of God, and that ark was enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Noah, his wife, his three sons, and three daughters-in-law all entered into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ark was not only trustworthy but also enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the ark was enterable, the eight people who entered into it were saved from the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In like manner, every airplane is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a 747 were only trustworthy and not enterable, we could not go anywhere with it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we enter into the 747, however, we are saved from the wind and the storm and we are on our way to our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our enterable God is the real ark and the real 747.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BELIEVING INTO THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>AND BAPTIZED INTO THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second type which shows that our God is enterable is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tabernacle is also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 1:14 tells us that the Word who was God Himself became flesh and tabernacled among men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ was a tabernacle for people to enter in. When we believed in Him, we entered into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 3:36 says, He who believes into the Son has eternal life lit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>. The same Greek preposition for into is used in Romans 6:3 which tells us that we have been baptized into Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just to say that you were baptized in Christ is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You were once outside of Christ, but when you were baptized into the water, that signified that you were baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, Matthew 28:19 indicates that we need to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We were once outside of the Triune God, but when we were baptized, we were baptized into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Vincent indicates in his word study that the preposition into denotes a kind of spiritual and mystical union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, an organic union transpired at the time we were baptized into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we were baptized into the Triune God, we were baptized into the very Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is just the Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because He is the Spirit, we all can be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This matter of our entering into the Triune God is a crucial aspect of the divine revelation which has been missed among most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we baptize people, it should not just be a ceremony or a religious form to accept people into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we baptize them, we must tell them to exercise their faith to be immersed into the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to tell the ones being baptized that we are not only baptizing them into the water, but also into all that the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Jews believe God, but they believe in an objective God that exists in the universe but has nothing to do with them experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our believing, however, is very subjective because we believe into God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our believing creates an organic union between us and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Into means entering in. No one told me when I was baptized that I was being immersed into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all have to realize this wonderful fact of our baptism, that is, when we were baptized, we entered into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BEING IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen that the three gates of the New Jerusalem portray the Triune God as our entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Also, the three parables in Luke 15 with the Son as the shepherd, the Spirit as the seeking woman, and the Father as the loving father, show us that the Triune God is receiving sinners, not only back to His home but also back into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all have entered into the Triune God and now we are in the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I always consider myself as a person in God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While I am living in my home, I am actually in God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While I am taking a plane, my sensation is that I am in God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While I am walking on the street, I am in God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am altogether in my Triune God, in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This one realization of being in God will preserve you from many evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you realize that you are in God, can you go dancing?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever you realize that you are in God, you would never fly to Las Vegas to gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Also, this realization will stop your gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We Christians gossip frequently nearly every day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, whenever you begin to gossip and you realize that you are in God, this realization will stop you from gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not jump out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To gossip is to jump out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not take a leave of absence from our dwelling place in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may feel that we could gossip a little bit and then come back into God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many times, however, after we gossip, it is hard for us to get back into God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to make a strong confession and let the blood wash us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then our conscience would be cleansed to allow us to be in God experientially.</S>
