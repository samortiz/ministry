        <h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH PASSING THROUGH<br />
THE PROCESS OF BEING TORN DOWN AND BUILT UP</h2>
<p>Based on the past two thousand years of church history and the biographies of many lovers of the Lord, the church is passing through death and resurrection; that is, the church is being torn down by men but is also being built up by the Lord. People are continually trying to tear down the church, and the Lord is continually building up the church. To tear down the church is to bring the flesh into the church. Thankfully, however, His building-up work is manifested through man&rsquo;s tearing down. Wherever there is a tearing down, there is also the building up.</p>
<p>We are learning to serve the Lord, to follow Him, and to work for Him, and our desire is for the church to be built up. Nevertheless, we have passed through numerous painful experiences. The turmoils in the church have caused much suffering, and sometimes it seems as if not one stone is left upon another. When we inquired of the Lord concerning these things, we received light from God&rsquo;s Word. Now we see that the church is built up in resurrection by passing through the process of tearing down. We must worship the Lord because the tearing down only enables Him to build up the church in resurrection. The Lord said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (2:19). While man&rsquo;s flesh is tearing down the church, resurrection is operating to build it up. While man&rsquo;s opinion is tearing down the church, resurrection is building it up. When we see that the church is being torn down, we become anxious, but God is not anxious. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, the church has been on the earth for two thousand years, why is it still not built up?&rdquo; The Lord may say, &ldquo;In My eyes, two thousand years are not that long; to Me a thousand years are like one day&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:8). The Lord is continually building up the church.</p>
<p>As the church is going through this process of tearing down and building up, we also are experiencing this same process individually. Sometimes the tearing down begins just when we feel that our condition is good. God&rsquo;s building work is completed in resurrection, but it begins with tearing down. We may feel bad when the tearing down comes, but God does not feel bad; we may be sorrowful, but God is never sorrowful. He will say, &ldquo;I am building through tearing down. I am building in resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without exception, we all want the church to advance, and we want the saints to be in one accord to propagate the gospel and to serve in mutual harmony and coordination. However, our situation is not according to our desire. At times, problems arise among the co-workers, among the elders, or among the saints. There are even problems in our environment and in the world situation. These problems cause the church to be torn down. When we see the tearing down, we may feel sorrowful and wonder why such things happen. But if we see the light in John 2, we will worship the Lord, because the tearing down prepares the ground for building up in resurrection. People will tear down the church, but the Lord will build it up in three days. He builds in resurrection. The work of tearing down is not yet complete, but neither is the work of building. As far as the Lord Jesus is concerned, His physical body has been torn down, and He is now building the church as His Body. For the past two thousand years man has been tearing down the church, but at the same time God has been building the church in resurrection.</p>
<p>Church history shows that the tearing down is often so miserable that everything seems to enter into a tomb. However, after a period of time resurrection brings us out of the tomb. Man cannot destroy God&rsquo;s temple. Man can only tear down outward things; man cannot destroy the inner content of the church. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; The Lord is still building God&rsquo;s house in resurrection. Although man may tear down, the Lord is building. What man tears down is small and physical, but the Lord builds up something that is enlarged and spiritual in resurrection. We do not need to be sorrowful when the church suffers. Rather, we should worship the Lord, and say, &ldquo;Lord, this is the journey of the church. The pathway of the church is one of tearing down and building up. The pathway of the church involves man trying his best to tear down, but You are building up in resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot build up the church simply by giving messages or by holding conferences and trainings. The building of the church lies in its being torn down again and again so that the Lord can build up in resurrection. Church history shows that this is the Lord&rsquo;s way. After He does a building work and His children are full of expectation, hope, and anticipation, He allows people to do a tearing-down work. When the condition of the church is good and the work is effective, the church often suffers from tearing down. There can be building up only when there is tearing down.</p>
<p>Whatever is natural can be torn down, and only that which is genuine and spiritual can be built up in resurrection. We cannot determine the measure of spirituality in our work. The measure of spirituality will be determined by what is left after our work passes through death. Only something genuine and spiritual will be resurrected after being torn down.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD OF COMFORT AND WARNING</h2>
<p>For the past ten years, we have been greatly blessed by the Lord; the brothers are serving and coordinating together in one accord. However, I do not have the assurance that this situation can be maintained. I am concerned that a storm will soon come upon us. I hope that this word will be a warning to us now and a comfort in the future. When a storm comes, we should not use our maneuvering to subdue it, nor should we try to be a peacemaker. Rather, we should let people tear down, even if not one stone is left upon another, because then we will see how much we have been constituted with resurrection. May we receive mercy in this matter so that we would not be those who tear down but those who are torn down. The tearing down will manifest how much of our work and person will pass through in resurrection.</p>
<p>A minister of the word once said that the church does not have a smooth pathway on the earth. This was true in the age of the apostle Paul, and it is true in our age. When Paul was old, Demas abandoned him, having loved the present age, and all who were in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 4:10; 1:15). He was left alone. This was a severe tearing down. We would not think that a person such as Paul, who was experienced, who was matured in life, and who had bountiful gifts and great spiritual authority, could fall into such a situation. The church and the believers must pass through this process while on earth. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; The history of the church on the earth speaks of a process of being torn down and being built up. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would not be those who tear down but those who are willing to be torn down. Then, after being torn down, we will be built up in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Lord came to change water into wine and then to build up God&rsquo;s house in resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s work cannot escape the principle of changing water into wine, nor can it avoid passing through the process of being torn down and being built up in resurrection. God will allow turmoils to rise up in the church so that whatever needs to be torn down will be torn down. Those who receive mercy will not take part in the tearing down but, instead, will be willing to be torn down to experience the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. We thank the Lord that He changes death into life. Any tearing down by man will only manifest resurrection.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
