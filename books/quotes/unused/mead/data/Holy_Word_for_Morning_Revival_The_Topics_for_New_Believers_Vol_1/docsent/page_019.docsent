   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 3 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 15:4, 7 Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When We Take His Word into Us, Having the Lord Abiding in Us and Being Filled with the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By comparing verses 4 and 7 of John 15 , we can see that the way the Lord abides in us is by His words abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The practical way to have the Lord abiding in us is simply by taking His Word in. Whenever we touch the Word and let the Word abide in us, we touch the Lord Himself and let the Lord Himself abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is clear from the Scriptures that the Word of Christ is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is proven from the verses we have read in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only way to have Christ abiding in us is to take in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was young, I read John 15 many times and wondered how I could have the Lord abiding in me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I found the way from the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To have the Lord abiding in us is simply to take His Word into us, because the Lord is in His Word and is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we take His Word into us, we have the Lord abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be filled with the Word in our spirit means to be filled with the Lord Himself as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Also, Colossians 3:16 tells us that when the Word of Christ dwells in us, we will be filled with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then Ephesians 5:18 and 19 tell us that when we are filled in spirit, we will be filled with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, to have the Word of Christ dwelling in us simply means to be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The concrete way to be filled in spirit is to take the Word into you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let me illustrate this with some safety matches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that a match is the embodiment of phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The phosphorus on a match will catch fire when it is struck in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you try to strike a safety match on the paper cover, it will not catch fire, because you are striking the match on the wrong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you strike the match on the striking area, it will catch fire immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, there is the phosphorus; second, the phosphorus is embodied in the match; and third, there is the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And within the Spirit, there is the fire, which is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On one hand, we have the match, the phosphorus, and the fire; on the other hand, we have the Bible, the Spirit, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever you read the Bible, do you really catch fire?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The problem is that we not only strike in the wrong way, but also at the wrong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of striking the Bible in our spirit, we strike it in our troublesome mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we analyze the match, we see that one part of the match is white, and another part is red.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But do we get fire by knowing this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, we must strike the match, and at the right spot.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To study the match is wrong, and to strike the match at the wrong spot is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Learning to Pray-read with Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we strike it at the right spot we get fire!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must forget our mind and learn to pray-read with our spirit: "Lord, I praise Thee, In the beginning '" John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Simply pray this three times, and your spirit will catch fire.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Hallelujah, in the beginning."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Really, this is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah, I don't know much what this means, but how it nourishes me!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are truly filled with the Word, we cannot help but sing with grace in our hearts to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we pray-read the Word, it will become a singing in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Simply learn to strike the Word in the right way and at the right spot.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then there will be a real fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>75</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
