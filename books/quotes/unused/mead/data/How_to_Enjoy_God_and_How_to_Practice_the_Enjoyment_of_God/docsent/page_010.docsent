   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING TO ENJOY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God does not intend for us to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As God s children, we need to change our concept and see that God s only desire is to give Himself to us to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The secret of the Christian life is not how much we work for Him, but how much we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not what we do for Him, but how we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must learn this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no need for us to worry about doing this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to learn to simply turn our inner being to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we pray, there is no need for us to be concerned about our difficulties and burdens, such as a seriously ill child.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn to come to God to enjoy and absorb Him, and forget about everything, even a child s illness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we forget, the Lord will not forget, but if we remember, the Lord often seems to ignore the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when we say, My brother Lazarus is sick, the Lord does not move faster for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we want Him to come and take care of a matter, the more He does not come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knows our Lazarus is sick, but He does not answer our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only when we stop does He come.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we insist, the more He waits until Lazarus finally dies, is buried, and begins to stink.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has no intention for us to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His only intention is that we learn to absorb and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Martha was always busy for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She did not know how to stop and absorb the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must learn to stop ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In particular, when we pray, we must learn to stop our involvement in so many affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be busy with so many matters when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether our prayer is for half an hour or only ten minutes, we should absorb and enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should feed on Him until we are full.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let the children be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let the difficulties remain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let the burdens take care of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord knows all about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should enjoy Him and be fed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should simply enjoy and absorb the Lord again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do this, we will be filled with God, and our face will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will be full of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a glory this will be!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sadly, the opposite is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many brothers and sisters are like the two disciples on the way to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are filled with sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They preach the gospel with wrinkles on their foreheads.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They visit people with sullen faces.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They go with their sorrows, not with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, the ones whom they visit have more sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some elders are sorrowful elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they consider hall twenty-eight, they shake their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they look at hall two, they bemoan the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When praying in the morning, they say, Lord, remember hall twenty-eight, and do not forget hall two.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not praying to the Lord; this is praying about halls.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The elders should forget about the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When they come to the Lord in the morning, they should behold His beauty, absorb Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As they are fed by Him and are filled with Him, their faces will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then when they visit hall twenty-eight in the evening, all the brothers and sisters will say that Moses has come.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will marvel at the shining face and say, The countenance of this elder has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His face is no longer sad but shining.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he stands up to speak, the Lord is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what it means to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no need for us to pray for so many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We simply need to touch the Lord, to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our relationship with the Lord is not based on matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has no intention for us to do anything for Him, nor does He have any intention of doing anything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our relationship with the Lord is not based on doing things but on enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said, Take, eat Matt 26:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that He wants us to remember Him, to take and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He has given Himself to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He has no desire to do anything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He simply desires to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He does not want us to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He desires us to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That is all He desires, and this is all that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He has become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We simply need to enjoy Him, and His glory will be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the meaning of being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brothers and sisters, only in this way will we find light, power, victory, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is how we will find the Lord of glory Himself.</S>
