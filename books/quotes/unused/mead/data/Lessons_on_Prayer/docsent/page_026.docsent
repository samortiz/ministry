   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SOBRIETY OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A mind that has been renewed should be very clean and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a mind is also surely transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes it is impossible to talk with certain brothers or sisters concerning spiritual things because their mind is neither clear nor bright.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it is all mixed up just like paste.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person with such a mentality is unable to discern between the head or tail of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To him, there is not much difference between eight and nine, nor is there much difference between nine and ten.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can someone like this pray?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If his mind is confused, surely he will not be able to pray with clarity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please read the examples of prayer in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You will find that none of those who prayed spoke silly words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hannah, the mother of Samuel, is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following the birth of Samuel, she went before God to offer her thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is unlikely that Hannah had much education, because there was no girls' school among the Israelites at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when you read her utterance in prayer, you can sense that she not only had a shining spirit, but also a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since her mind was as clear as a glass window, the Spirit of God could directly utter words of prayer through her spirit in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament there was another mother, Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being of a humble background, she was not highly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Her prayer, however, demonstrates that her mind was also very sober and her thinking was not at all confused.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Confused prayers are the products of confused minds.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of God's mercy, He may answer many nonsensical prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, one should not be content with praying silly prayers, thinking that one way or the other God will always listen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All those who know prayer realize that many times when we go before God to pray, it is like handling diplomatic affairs or defending a case in court.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A lawyer knows that when defending his client his mind must be clear and his words must be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A sober speech is based on his ability to understand as well as to speak forth clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, in order to be a man of prayer, we need a mind that is renewed and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The renewing of the mind is the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in order to have a sober mind we ourselves need to be responsible to exercise it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE CONCENTRATION OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our mind should not only be sober, but should also be able to concentrate well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe many brothers and sisters have realized that the biggest problem in our prayer is a desultory mind, a mind which does not easily concentrate but always drifts about.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When some brothers and sisters kneel down to pray, in less than five minutes their minds begin to travel around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One moment they think of the United States, then their thoughts move on to Great Britain, and later they think of Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their minds cannot be focused, and their thoughts fly everywhere and go every place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe we have all had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason we are unable to pray is that our thoughts continually drift.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot either collect or direct them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is very strange that this does not happen while we read the Bible or talk with people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, for some unexplainable reason, whenever we pray it seems that a telegraph inside keeps transmitting messages until we become disabled in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is what is referred to as being scatterbrained.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may not be aware of having a mind that is not sober, but we are very clear concerning what it means to be scatterbrained.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once our thoughts become scattered, we cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, in order to pray, we must have a proper concentration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To gain a proper concentration requires regular exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way to properly exercise your mind is to control your thinking, not allowing your thoughts to run wild.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people are too loose and free in their thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a person indulges his mind, exercising no control or restriction over it whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The mind of such a one is like a wild horse running loose without a bridle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only is that person unable to pray, but he is also unable to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Learn to control your mind, and do not allow it to fall into fanciful thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Always restrict your mind to not think beyond its proper limit, but think only of the things that pertain to your duty or responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, if you are going to visit a friend today, you need to exercise your mind a little to consider which way to go, the means of transportation, the best time to go, what to do there, and when to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because this kind of thinking pertains to your responsibility, it is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But sometimes you allow yourself to think of things about which you should not be thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At such a time, you need to restrict yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At times you may find yourself unable to restrict your thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then I would suggest that you perform some chores or read a book.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever you discover that your mind is running wild, try your best to keep yourself busy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more you let it go, the more wild your mind becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such indulgence makes you unable to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Also, many times thoughts which are not our own may come into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These are darts shot from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These darting thoughts also distract our mind and disturb our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, we must learn to refuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even though they may return after you refuse them, do not receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes, the more you refuse those darting thoughts, the fiercer they become.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is like mischievous children knocking at your door.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more you tell them not to knock, the louder they knock.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At that time, you can stop refusing them and just ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the same way, by refusing and ignoring those thoughts, they too will just go away.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In summary, to properly concentrate we need to practice the control of our thinking and refuse the darting thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After such practice, our mind will spontaneously be directed in a proper way; then when we again kneel down to pray our mind will respond to our direction and will be able to concentrate.</S>
