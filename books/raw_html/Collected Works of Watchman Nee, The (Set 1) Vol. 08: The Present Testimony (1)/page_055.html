<P>Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace you have been saved." This is the past salvation.</P><P>Romans 8:24 says, "For we are saved by hope" [KJV]. This means that we are in the process of being saved; this is the present salvation.</P><P>Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled." This is in the future.</P><P>We thank and praise God that we have been saved! However, there are still two kinds of salvation which we have not yet achieved. Therefore, we need to pursue further. Some may not think that they are saved, so we tell them that once they believe they are saved. This refers to being saved from the punishment of hell. We have been saved from hell, but we still need to be delivered from the power of sin and pursue after the glory in the future kingdom. Therefore, we should work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</P><P>Dwight L. Moody was a very powerful preacher and extremely capable in saving souls. In his lifetime he said that he had never seen a lazy person be saved! Even if a person desires to be delivered from the punishment of hell, he cannot obtain it if he is lazy. "Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" (Eph. 5:14).</P><P>In the past few weeks I have mentioned many times that we are incapable in ourselves. If it is up to us to do anything, it will be very difficult. But if we are willing to surrender and believe, then Christ will do it on our behalf. While one should listen to this side of the truth, there is another side of the truth: to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. This is our responsibility for, if we do not do this, we are off. No doubt, Christ has died on my behalf, shed His blood on my behalf, and resurrected and ascended on my behalf. Some may think that since this is the case, all we need to do is just worship and be absolutely passive. There is no need to pray, read the Bible, and donate. However, we need to know that since God has done this, we can work out our salvation even more fervently. Since God has done it, we should work it out. How can we work it out? The following verse tells us the answer.</P><P>Philippians 2:13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Verses 12 and 13 are two sides of a most glorious truth; they include everything. If you look at the first verse, you think that we should do everything. But if you look at the second verse, it seems that God will do everything. On one hand, we should work out our salvation, and on the other hand, God will work it out. This is not contradictory, but complementary. Verse 12 says that we should work out our salvation, and verse 13 says that God is able to make us do what we should do.</P><P>These two verses explain two very important aspects of truth in the Bible. In one aspect there are many severe commandments in the Bible from God. He commands us to do this and do that. It seems that God has given us a hard burden that we can hardly bear. It seems almost impossible to take any step forward. We seem pressed to death. But in the other aspect there are many promises from God. They tell us that this and that are taken care of by God. Everything is God's grace and God's doing. It seems it is not necessary for us to do anything. Due to a lack of understanding of these two aspects of truth, some people tend to go to the extreme. Some think that everything is a commandment from God and that they must do it all by themselves. They see God's commandments as heavy burdens. They are not able to bear them, yet they are afraid not to bear them. They seem to be pressed to death. Others think that everything is according to God's grace. Everything is God's doing, and everything is done by God. They themselves do not need to bear any responsibility. This invariably leads to laxity toward themselves. When man deviates—it does not matter which way he deviates—there is a danger that he will neither abide by God's commandments nor receive God's promises in the Bible. God's truths are balanced on both sides. God is working inside of us, and we are working outwardly—working out what God has done within us. If we only let God work inwardly, without our working outwardly, we cannot receive anything. But if we are working outwardly, and nothing is being done by God inwardly, we cannot achieve anything.</P><P>All things in our human life are covered by these two matters: the willing and the working. To will is an inward decision; to work is an outward behavior. Whatever is decided within, we fulfill without. This is the willing and the working. Willing refers to our inward situation; working refers to our outward living. But both our inward willing and outward working are God's operating within us, which operates until we fulfill His good pleasure. All our willingness is according to God's operating, and all our working is also according to God's operating.</P><P>Oftentimes, we want to obey God, but we cannot do so. However, God says, "I am operating in you; therefore, it is possible to obey; you can do it." Many Christians suffer so much because they cannot do so many things. Many times they tell God, "It is such a suffering to obey You. I just cannot do it. I want to forsake the world, but I cannot do it. I should not hate someone, but I cannot help it." However, God has no intention for you to suffer. He wants to operate within you until you can do it. Therefore, you should tell God, "Although I cannot obey You, and I cannot give up the world, nor do I know how to love others, I ask You to work within me until I am willing to obey You, until I am willing to give up the world, and until I am willing not to hate others." If you believe after you pray this way, there surely will be changes. Even if you have things which you have not been able to overcome for years, by committing and believing this way, you will be able to overcome.</P><P>When Mr. [Chapman] first began his ministry, his congregation grew day by day, and he had a large chapel built. When Mr. Moody heard of his name, he took a train to listen to his preaching. After Mr. Moody arrived at the meeting hall, he sat there silently listening. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Chapman, who knew Moody, came down from the platform to Moody to ask his opinion. Mr. Moody said, "Brother, what you have ministered is a failure. It is not a success. There is some flaw in your life." When Mr. Chapman heard this word, he was not happy. He thought, "Mr. Moody should not have criticized me in this way. He has no authority to say that." However, Moody had said what he said. At any rate, Mr. Chapman knew that there was one weakness in himself. He realized that he was too attached to his wife and children. He felt bad for two or three weeks. Finally, he said to God, "I have no way not to love my wife and children, but I pray You would work until I can." From that day on, he learned how to love his wife and children. Later, he ministered effectively. Someone asked him to give a testimony, and he said only a few words: "If I know how to preach the gospel and minister, or if there is anything good in me, I know where it came from. It came from that time when I obeyed."</P>
