   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Problem of the Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The ninth case Paul dealt with in 1 Corinthians is the exercise of the gifts 12:1 14:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even the spiritual gifts can be a problem to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It all depends on how we exercise these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we need to realize that all the spiritual gifts and the exercise of the gifts must be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 12:12 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the gifts with their functions and exercise must be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, we should realize that not only is the Head Christ but the Body also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Following this, verse 13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This tells us that all the gifts from the Holy Spirit are for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regrettably, however, the gifts today often distract believers from the Body rather than build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What should be used for building becomes a distraction; this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we have the gifts, function with the gifts, and exercise the gifts, the more we need to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the believers must be focused on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not distract any member from the Body by using our gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The best way for us to exercise the gifts is in the way of love 13:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Love is the best, excellent way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Real love is Christ with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to exercise the genuine love toward others, we must experience Christ with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our self has to be dealt with, and we must take Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we will know how to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even with the exercise of the gifts, we may not have love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, instead of loving others, we may simply speak in tongues every day with no concern for others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we read chapters twelve through fourteen carefully, we will see that the intention of the writer is that we would prefer to have love rather than to exercise the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our exercise of spiritual gifts does not build up others or profit others, we should be willing to drop the gifts and exercise our love toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the best way for us to exercise our gifts, because their purpose is to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our exercise of the gifts does not fulfill this purpose, we should be willing to drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If love builds up others more than gifts do, we should exercise love rather than the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here again we must apply the first principle of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The person who has the gifts must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then he will have the best way to exercise the gifts, which is love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This love, no doubt, is Christ with the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Problem concerning Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tenth case involves the matter of resurrection 15:1-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is surprising that even a real Christian would not believe that there is a resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These were not "modernists"; the Corinthians were genuine Christians, but among them there were some who did not believe in the fact of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This case is related to the third principle in this book, the principle of being spiritual, soulish, or fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These few were soulish persons because they tried to reason concerning the resurrection by their mental understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot understand spiritual things with our mentality, our soulish mind; if we try to, we are soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this chapter there is a spiritual and heavenly revelation that not only confirms the resurrection but reveals the ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ will transpire on the day Christ returns and life swallows up death v. 54 . Here, therefore, it is not only a matter of resurrection, but a matter of life swallowing up death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time the Body of Christ will be in its full consummation, testifying what Christ is and how much He is.</S>
