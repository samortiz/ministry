<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Tabernacle of God</H2><P>Christ is the tabernacle of God (John 1:14b), which refers to Jesus as a man in the flesh to be God's temporary dwelling place among men on the earth. God dwelt in Him as in the tabernacle (tent) in the wilderness, like the children of Israel had the tabernacle of God as God's dwelling place among them while they were wandering in the wilderness (Exo. 25:8-9). The tabernacle in the wilderness was a prefigure, a type, of Christ being the real tabernacle as God's temporary, movable dwelling place among men on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Lamb, the Spirit, the House (Bethel),<br>and the Heavenly Ladder</H2><P>The Lamb, the Spirit, the house (Bethel), and the heavenly ladder (John 1:29-51) form a group of what Christ is, as the Word of God speaking for God, in the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Lamb of God</H2><P>Christ is the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world judicially (vv. 29, 36) to make whatever He did for God's economy legal according to the righteousness of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Spirit</H2><P>Christ firstly had the dove, signifying the Spirit of God, abiding upon Him (vv. 32-33), and subsequently in His resurrection He became, organically, the Spirit of God who gives life (1 Cor. 15:45b). As such a Spirit, He transforms God's redeemed people, who were made with clay, into stones (John 1:37-42).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The House (Bethel)</H2><P>It is for the building up of the house of God at Bethel (this house of God is the intrinsic and basic line of the Gospel of John concerning the church, the Body of Christ) that His redeemed people are transformed by the Spirit into stones organically. First Peter 2:4 and 5 say that Christ is a precious stone, a living stone, and we come to Him that we may also become living stones for the building up of God's house. Because of the fall, we became distorted clay. God's way is not to reform distorted ones, but to transform the clay into stones. The Lamb is for redemption. The Spirit is for transformation so that we can be stones for the building up of God's house, Bethel.</P>
