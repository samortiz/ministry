   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Once you become a Christian, you must leave your past temperament behind.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is no such thing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Often the church suffers because many people try to bring their natural flavor and peculiar traits into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When those who do not like to talk gather together, they become a quiet group.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When those who chatter gather together, they become a chattering group.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When those who are cold gather together, they become a group of cold people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When those who are warm gather together, they become a group of warm people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, many distinctions are built up among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, there is no place for natural dispositions in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Christ and in the new man, there is no place for natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not think that others are wrong because their disposition is different from yours.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must realize that your own disposition is also unacceptable to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether you are quick or quiet, cold or warm, intellectual or emotional, once you become a brother or a sister, you must put off these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you bring these natural elements into the church, they will become the basis of confusion and division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you bring your disposition and temperament into the church, you will make yourself the standard and the criteria.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are up to your standard will be classified as good Christians, and those who are not up to your standard will be classified as poor Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who get along with your character will be deemed right and those who do not get along with your character will be deemed wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When this happens, the church will suffer through your disposition and temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such distinctions must never exist in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second distinction is between free men and slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This distinction has also been eliminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christ, the distinction between free men and slaves does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians during the Roman era when slavery was practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time slaves were like animals or tools; they were their masters' possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Children born to slaves were automatically slaves; they had no freedom their whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The distinction between the free man and the slave was very great.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, God does not allow this distinction to exist in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians all say that there cannot be free man or slave.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This distinction has been eliminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third distinction is between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Christ and in the new man, the male and the female have the same status; there is no distinction between them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The male does not occupy a special position; neither does the female.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Christ is all and in all, there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In spiritual matters there is no difference between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A brother is saved by the life of Christ, that is, by the life of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A sister also is saved by the life of Christ, the life of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brother has become God's son, and the sister has become God's son as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Christ we are all God's sons, and there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fourth distinction is between barbarians and Scythians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a distinction of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are differences in cultural standards, yet Paul told us that the cultural distinctions of barbarians and Scythians alike have been abolished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, we should learn to be a Jew among Jews, and to be as under law to those under law 1 Cor 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among people of other cultures, we should behave according to their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should learn to be one with all people in all places.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we contact those of a different culture, we should learn to be one with them in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The final distinction is between circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This distinction has to do with marks of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Jews have the mark of circumcision on their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It shows that they belong to God, that they fear God, and that they reject the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet they overemphasize circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Acts 15 speaks of some Jews who tried to compel the Gentiles to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christians also have their "marks of piety in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, baptism, head covering, the breaking of bread, the laying on of hands, and so on can all become marks of piety.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Baptism has a spiritual meaning, but it can also be a mark of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Head covering with the sisters has a spiritual meaning, but it can also be a mark of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Bread-breaking and the laying on of hands have spiritual meanings, but they can also become marks of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of these things have spiritual meaning; they are all spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, we may use these things to separate God's children, boasting about marks which others do not have, and the result is disunity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do this, we have downgraded these matters from their spiritual level and made them mere physical marks in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When this happens, we become, in principle, the same as the Jews who boasted in circumcision; our baptism, head covering, bread-breaking, and hand-laying have become our "circumcision."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we differentiate between God's children based on these things, we have made distinctions according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, in Christ there is no distinction between circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No physical mark of the flesh can be used to differentiate God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Christ we are made one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The life in Christ is one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All of these things are outside of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of course, it is good to have the spiritual reality that accompanies these physical marks.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if one has the spiritual reality yet is lacking in the physical marks, we cannot count him out.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's children should not allow physical marks to damage the oneness in the Lord and the oneness in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all are brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are the new man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all are members in the Body, and we all are parts of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once we are in the church, we should not have any distinction outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Everyone stands on new ground.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone is in the new man created by the Lord and everyone is in the Body built up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must see that all of God's children are one.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no place for superiority or inferiority.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must eliminate the denominational and sectarian thoughts from our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we do this, there will be no division in the meeting of the church of God and in the fellowship between the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to pay attention to these matters in the meeting, and we have to live out such a life in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>May God bless us.</S>
