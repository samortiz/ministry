   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FULLNESS EXPRESSION OF HIM WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church as the Body of Christ is the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:23 says that the church "is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grammatically, "the fullness'' is in apposition to "His Body.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that the Body is the fullness and the fullness is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Body of Christ is His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fullness issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the enjoyment of Christ's riches, we become His fullness to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This fullness is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ, who is the infinite God without limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a great Christ needs the Body to be His fullness for His complete expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians do not understand what the word fullness means in Eph 1:23 and 3:19.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think the word fullness means riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fullness does not mean the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ephesians the unsearchable riches of Christ are mentioned in 3:8.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must differentiate between the riches and the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The United States has supermarkets full of the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The riches of America are its products, but the fullness of America is a husky American.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This fullness is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fullness comes out of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if we do not eat and digest the riches, we may have them without having the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The riches issue in the fullness through eating and digesting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not eat and digest the riches, we shall remain skinny and short.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, the church is not only the Body of Christ, but also the fullness, the expression, which issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This fullness is the expression of the very One, the universal Christ, who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Colossians 3:11 says that Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All, both times in this verse, refers to people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Ephesians 1:23, however, the "all in all'' which Christ fills is something universal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is unlimited Eph 1:23; 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The dimensions of the universe are actually the dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How long is the length?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How high is the height?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How deep is the depth?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How broad is the breadth?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No one can tell.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The dimensions of Christ in Ephesians 3:18 are unsearchable and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These dimensions are the description of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ fills all in all, and we the church, by enjoying His riches, eventually become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I had only a head, without a body, I would have no fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This fullness is my expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must realize that the church as the Body of Christ is Christ's fullness as His expression.</S>
