The New Man</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him [Christ] who created him; where [in the new man] there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all [men] and in all [men]&#8221;</b> (Col. 3:10-11).</p><p>Just as all of mankind is a corporate old man created in Adam, the church is also a corporate new man. Christ, having abolished on the cross all the ordinances which caused discord among men, created this new man in Himself (Eph. 2:14-15). This new man bears the image of its Creator, Christ, who is its life and its content. In this new man, there are no persons of the old creation belonging to any race, religion, culture, or class. Only Christ is all the constituents of this new man and is in all its constituents. The church as the Body of Christ takes Christ as its life for His expression; the church as the new man takes Christ as its person for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s will.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE CHURCH</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The church of God...those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints&#8221;</b> (1 Cor. 1:2).</p><p>The church is constituted with all those who have believed into Christ and who possess His life. Any person who has not believed into Christ and has not been saved cannot become a constituent of the church. Without being saved, even our closest relatives are not constituents of the church. Only after they are saved and have the Lord&#8217;s life to become saints are they constituents of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Universal Aspect</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;On this rock I [Christ] will build My church&#8221;</b> (Matt. 16:18).</p><p>The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the universal aspect. It is unique, including all who have believed into Him in the universe through all the ages and in every place.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Local Aspect</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church&#8221;</b> (Matt. 18:17).</p><p>The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the local aspect. It is numerous and its local believers can speak to it. According to the local aspect, the church appears in every locality. Each local church includes only those who have believed into Christ in that place.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE DESIGNATION OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. It Has No Special Name</h2><p>The church is unique and has no need of special names. The church is the church; there should not be kinds of churches that are denominated according to their kind, such as the Presbyterian church, the Lutheran church, and the Baptist church. To denominate the church in this way is needless and not according to the biblical revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. It May Be Designated by the Name of Its Locality</h2><p>Although the church is unique in the universe, it is numerous in its local manifestation. The many local churches do not differ in nature; their difference is only in the different places where they are. Therefore, we may use the name of the locality in which a local church is to designate that church, such as the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), and the seven local churches in the province of Asia (Rev. 1:4, 11).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Life Lessons, Vol. 1 (#1-12) &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
