   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: We worship You for Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of Your presence, we are full of faith that You are working here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we confess our weakness, smallness, and even uselessness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Your mercy is our trust.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, cleanse us fully.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need Your cleansing within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thank You for Your cleansing blood and for Your anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, speak to each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Give each one of us a word, a word that You want us to have tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, we thank and praise You for the blood, the anointing, and the sanctifying word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>O Lord Jesus, open all of us up from deep within, and may we open up to You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, may there be nothing whatsoever hidden or veiled within us, and may we not shrink back and hide from Your face.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do wish to see You face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May Your countenance, which is Your lovely face, become our help.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, we have followed You for years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your presence has always been with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tonight, we need Your presence with us even more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Touch the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, You are our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We worship You here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We want to know You more, and we want to know more concerning Your organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also want to know ourselves and all the members more thoroughly so that we can enter into the consciousness of Your Body and maintain a proper relationship not only with You but also with all the members in Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, we can never forget Your evil enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You know that he is following us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where You work, he is also busy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, we pray that You would bind him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also bind him in Your victorious name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We believe that whatsoever we bind here has been bound by You in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, bind Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have promised that You will put him under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May this word be fulfilled among us tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Clear out everything in us that has the poison and the bite of the serpent so that he can be trampled out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lord, release Your word, so that all of us would receive Your boundless supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Visit us once again so that we would have more of Your glory within and would express more of Your magnificence without.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SEEING THE ONENESS AND ARRIVING AT THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>About a year has past since I was last here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am so happy to see the brothers again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I wish to have some further intimate and thorough fellowship with all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After reading all the verses and the outline of this message, I believe you should have some impression that what I am sharing with you tonight is of two points: one is the oneness, and the other is the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The oneness may seem high and far away in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the one accord is very near and is even right here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It describes the condition within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The term one accord speaks of something related to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the examples in the New Testament, oneness is very objective.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems far away in heaven and hard to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the one accord is very subjective; it speaks directly of our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, we can say that the one accord is the oneness in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The oneness without the one accord is only something on paper and has no reality to it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we only speak of oneness without speaking about the one accord, we may have only some high and great doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They may be good, but they are not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if we add the one accord to the oneness, we are "pulling the oneness down close to us," like pulling a kite down from the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will bring the oneness right to where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have the one accord, we will have the oneness among us in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, we must first talk about the oneness, and then the practice of oneness, which is the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For quite a long time, I have been bothered as I considered our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not only among those outside of us, but even among us the oneness and the one accord have suffered a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The oneness has been neglected, and the one accord has been set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This has been our overall condition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For this reason, I have been constantly burdened within and have always wanted to come back to see all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I feel that our present need is to see the oneness, to emphasize it, and to dive into the significance of the oneness in an intensified way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the same time, we should fellowship about the oneness in a serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In particular, we must arrive at the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without the one accord, there is no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At most, there is the talk about oneness; there is no practicality of this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For this reason we have to thoroughly see the oneness spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The world talks about oneness also.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As long as there is an organization, there is talk about oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A family wants to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A school wants to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In an institution or an army, people talk about oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even in a community, or a little club, the same is true.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What then is the difference between the oneness spoken of in the Bible and the oneness the world talks about?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The oneness the Bible talks about is very different from the oneness the world talks about.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is even different from the oneness we may be used to talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The term "oneness" is the same for these different peoples, but its nature and ingredient are different.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is like the example of a ring; a platinum ring is of one nature, a gold ring is of another nature, and a brass ring is yet of another nature.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The shape may be quite similar, but their natures are absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can say that the oneness we talked about in the past did not touch the intrinsic nature of the oneness spoken of in the Bible.</S>
