   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Principle of Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, in order for a board to stand, it cannot depend on only one tenon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there were only one tenon, the board would spin, but with two tenons, the board could not spin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, in the matter of building, there is the need for two; one cannot work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you stand by yourself, you will turn toward the east today, toward the south tomorrow, and toward the west the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After turning a full circle, you will turn toward the south again, and after a few days you will turn again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You will always be turning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Christian who is always turning cannot be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When there are two tenons, you have no way to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, you must stand with another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You cannot serve by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them out two by two Luke 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord did not want His disciples to go out by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our coordination should also be in twos.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot be at peace if someone is serving alone, because we are afraid that he will begin to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When two persons are in coordination, one cannot turn without the other turning too.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no way for one to turn if the other refuses to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They both must stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only so, you must remember that you are only a half.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are only one and a half cubits, not three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You need another person, another one and a half cubits, to be added to you so that you become three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When one sister is added to another sister, the two become three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They become a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they are separated, they will each be one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a half unit, not a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, the Holy Spirit has revealed to us that we must be in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Gold Overlaying Wood</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order for us to coordinate, based on the foundation of Christ s redemption, we must be overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is seen with the boards, which were made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the only way for us to manifest the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wood denotes the human nature, and gold denotes the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Gold overlaying wood signifies the mingling of the human nature and the divine nature so that the human nature can express the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that man lives the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, there is a human living that expresses the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The boards, which were made of acacia wood, needed to be overlaid with gold in order to be joined.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, when we experience the mingling of God and man, that is, the mingling of God s life with our life and God s nature with our nature, we can be coordinated with the other standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Gold Rings</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The standing boards were also united by gold rings Exo 26:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The uniting rings show that the divine nature is the uniting power among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are made of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to experience the uniting rings in our human nature, we need the divine life and nature to be manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we love the Lord, live before Him, and fellowship with Him, the more He will be manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the gold rings, the divine uniting power, are manifested in us and enable us to be united with others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Bars</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There was also the need for bars.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On each side of the tabernacle there were five bars for the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The bars were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The five bars formed three lines, and the middle bar passed through the center of the boards from end to end. The bars were arranged such that two bars formed a line at the top, two bars formed a line below, and one bar passed through the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, the numbers three and five are also involved with the bars.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Three signifies the three-one God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Five is four plus one, signifying the created man plus the Creator being able to bear spiritual responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The uniting of the boards lies entirely in the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The boards were overlaid with gold, and the bars that were overlaid with gold united the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The boards were united by means of the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Likewise, we can be united to be the church, the house of God, because we have the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are wooden boards.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we did not have the divine nature, He could not be expressed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we live according to our human nature, according to the flesh, we will eventually be scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we live in the divine nature, we are overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way, we are full of gold, full of the expression of God s glory, His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must remember that we are all united in oneness by the gold of God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, not only are we standing, but we are also united.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to Exodus 27:1-8, the bronze altar in the outer court did not have any silver.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The bronze altar had only bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Bronze signifies God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The hangings of fine twined linen in the outer court were held and joined by hooks and connecting rods, both of which were made of silver vv.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>9-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that Christ s redemption, which issues out of God s righteous judgment, links us to God s righteousness, signified by the linen, for God s testimony and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In other words, Christ s redemption as our foundation brings us into God s nature and mingles us with God so that we can be overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then we can have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not enough for us to be redeemed by the Lord and have a little change in our behavior and our living, because God still does not have His building.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must be overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must let God mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As we are overlaid with gold, the divine and human natures are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the one hand, we stand on Christ s redemption as our foundation, and on the other hand, we are mingled with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the way for us to become a structure, God s building, in which there is God s presence and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we would express God and be full of His glory and presence, we must be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more we are joined to Him, the more we will have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we are all joined by the divine nature, we will be filled with the presence and the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even though we have the human nature, we will live in the divine nature because we are overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will be human beings who live by God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The more we live in the divine life and nature, the more we will have the atmosphere and element of gold filling our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Furthermore, by means of the gold we will be joined into one to become God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then God s glory will fill our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the building up of the church, and this is also the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then whoever comes into our midst will sense the glory of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When they contact us, they will acknowledge that God is among us and that this is God s dwelling place.</S>
