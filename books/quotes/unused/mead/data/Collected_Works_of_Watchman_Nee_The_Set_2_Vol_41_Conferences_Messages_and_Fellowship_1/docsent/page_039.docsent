   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN CONSECRATION Date: November 17, 1935, afternoon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1; 6:13; 2 Cor 5:14-15 INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God saves us for the purpose of living for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has not saved us merely for the purpose of separating us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has saved us for the purpose of separating us from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the end, we will be sanctified, that is, fully separated unto the Lord cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 17:14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Christian who has not overcome is not a happy Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He lives in defeat constantly and has conflict in his heart continually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This conflict and defeat occur because he has not consecrated himself in an absolute way to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THINGS TO DO BEFORE AND AFTER OVERCOMING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The consecration that is spoken of in the Bible is an absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our consecration is not absolute, at the most we can be second-class Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are two things that a Christian should do before he can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first is to let go, and the second is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are also two things that he should do after he overcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first is to make confession for his sins, and the second is to consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have already spoken of letting go, believing, and confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we will consider the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We possess many things which we are not willing to consecrate, such as our money, family, time, and career.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are unable to consecrate because we have not yet overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can consecrate only when we stand on the ground of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who have not experienced victory cannot consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we take the Lord as our victory, it is very easy for us to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have not taken the Lord as our victory and then say that we cannot consecrate ourselves, I will say, "Amen, that is right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can never consecrate yourself by yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 6:13 says that consecration comes after the experience of dying and resurrecting with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can consecrate ourselves to God only after we are "alive from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people think that they are living a consecrated life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, they have not even touched the entrance to such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless we first experience the victory of Christ, we cannot consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONSECRATION BASED ON GOD'S SAVING GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 12:1 says, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word "compassions" is plural in number; it refers to the multifarious grace mentioned in Romans 1 through 8.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the sequence of teaching in the book of Romans, chapter twelve should immediately follow chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the compassions mentioned in chapter twelve refer to the things covered in chapters one through eight.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Son of God has died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has died for us and saved us from the punishment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is now living for us and delivering us from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has shown all of these compassions toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul was not commanding us but exhorting us to present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the first eight chapters, we are told that we were sinners and that the Son of God shed His blood to redeem us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Chapters three and four speak of the blood, chapter five speaks of forgiveness, and chapters six through eight speak of the cross crucifying our old man and releasing us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord died for us once, and He is now living for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once we believe in the Lord's death and resurrection, we become the Lord's. Many people are willing to be delivered from hell, but unfortunately they are not willing to be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are willing to be delivered from sin, but they are not willing to be sanctified and separated absolutely to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has saved us, and we have believed in this saving fact.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There was once a Christian girl from Abyssinia, Africa, who was sold as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the beginning of the auction, three men were bidding fiercely for her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All three were evil, and the girl knew that she would suffer greatly no matter whose hand she fell into.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She was weeping and full of sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Finally, a fourth man came and made the highest bid.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As soon as he bought her, he sent for a blacksmith to break her chains, and said to the girl, "You are free."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then he turned around and walked away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At first the girl did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later she came to her senses and shouted, "He has bought me!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has bought me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From this day forward until the day I die, I will follow him."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This story is happening to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord's love has constrained us, and we must tell Him that we will follow Him from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A brother was once riding on a train and was invited to participate in a card game.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He told those who invited him, "Sorry friends, I have not brought my hands along with me today."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The others looked at him in surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He went on, "My two hands are the Lord's. The hands that once sinned and played card games are now crucified with the Lord." He saw that since he had consecrated himself to the Lord, his hands were the Lord's and no longer his own.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once while waiting for a bus ride, I saw a book of a questionable nature in a shop, and I was tempted to look at it, but the Lord forbade me and I dared not open the book.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>My eyes have been consecrated to the Lord; they are no longer mine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today we need such a realization.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to know that the Lord has purchased us and that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This feeling is indeed sweet and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some may criticize us for being too narrow or stubborn, but while their mouths criticize us, their hearts admire us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Such Christians are the happiest people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nothing can give us greater joy than consecrating ourselves absolutely to the Lord, for we are consecrating ourselves to the Lord who loves us most dearly.</S>
