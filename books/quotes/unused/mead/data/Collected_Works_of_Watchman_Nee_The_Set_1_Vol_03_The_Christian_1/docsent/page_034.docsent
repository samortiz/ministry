   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE STORY OF CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TRUTH CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE DISPENSATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to understand the Bible clearly, we must divide the Bible into different dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The revelation of God in the Bible differs according to different dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God uses a particular way to deal with people in each dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If these dispensations are mixed together in the study of the Bible, some will see many contradictions and find many passages that are difficult to understand because they do not realize that God's dealing with man differs according to different dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unbelievers think that these contradictions exist because the writers of the Bible had an incomplete concept of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that the concept of God gradually evolved until it became bright and clear at the time of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the tone of unbelievers who try to discredit the Bible as God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot accept this, but we admit that there is a progression of doctrine in the different books in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we see only faintly at the beginning of the Old Testament is manifested, in the clear light of the New Testament, as being short of full revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not because of man's changing concept of God, but rather because God's revelation to man is different.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's dealing with man differs according to a particular dispensation; therefore, God gradually reveals Himself to man and also reveals what kind of conduct man should have during the dispensation in which he is living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must divide the Bible into distinct dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people think that the only dispensational division in the Bible is the one between the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although this division is an excellent help for study, it is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the scholars who have studied the Bible carefully have seen that there are seven dispensations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This analysis is not based on man's idea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By diligent study, one can see that there is a natural division of seven dispensations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first of the seven dispensations is the dispensation of innocence, covering the period of time when Adam and Eve were in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second dispensation is the dispensation of conscience, covering the period from the time after Adam was driven out of paradise and received a conscience until the end of the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The third dispensation is the dispensation of human rule, covering the period of time after the flood until the scattering at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fourth dispensation is the dispensation of promise, covering the period between the call of Abraham and the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fifth dispensation is the dispensation of law, covering the period from the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the law at Mount Sinai until the time of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sixth dispensation is the dispensation of grace, covering the period of time from the death of the Lord Jesus and the descension of the Holy Spirit until the rapture of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seventh dispensation is the dispensation of the kingdom, beginning with the second coming of the Lord Jesus and the establishment of the kingdom on the earth until the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the millennium the heavens and the earth will be consumed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then God will make a new heaven and new earth where the righteous will dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will be the beginning of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two most important dispensations in the Bible are those of law and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These dispensations are the longest and most frequently mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The original condition of man, God's covenant with man, man's fall, and God's judgment are all different in these dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not separate the different dispensations when we read the Bible, we will see many contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God deals differently with people in each dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not carefully differentiate between the dispensations, we might expect the people in this dispensation to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This would create confusion and cause us to misunderstand the meaning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The seven dispensations of the Bible tell us the different ways in which God dealt with man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The greatest purpose of God in these seven dispensations, so far as man is concerned, is to show that man should be saved by grace and not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Galatians 3 tells us that when God gave His promise to Abraham, His purpose was that man would be saved through grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time man did not know that he was sinful and would not admit that he was powerless to save himself through good works.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To show man that he was sinful and could not do good, God added the law after He gave His promise to Abraham so that man might know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of God's commandments and charges in the law show man's inward impotence and defilement so that he would be willing to receive grace and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the nature of man, no one likes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All men think that they are capable in themselves, capable of good works, without sin in themselves, clean, and capable of being saved through good works.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason God must first cause man to know himself; only then will he admit that he is helpless, only then will he confess that he is a sinner and receive God's grace without any pride.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God spent more than fifteen hundred years in the dispensation of the law to prove that no one in the world could keep His law or do good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a test of fifteen centuries God manifested His real purpose in the dispensation of grace: man can be saved through believing in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This grace is given to the world through the Lord Jesus' death for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a pity that even today there are many people who still do not know that they are full of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are still planning to be saved through works.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These people should return to the dispensation of law and be tested in order to know themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can only say this much concerning the teaching of the seven dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we want to point out why the story of creation in Genesis 1 expresses the teaching of these seven dispensations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are many writers in Europe and in the United States who are more capable than I and who have written many discourses on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not believe that I can write better than they, but I just want to mention these points briefly in order to help those who do not yet know this teaching.</S>
