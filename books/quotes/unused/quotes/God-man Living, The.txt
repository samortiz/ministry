We can be His children forming the church, issuing in the Body of Christ and consummating in the New Jerusalem
God's good pleasure is to be one with man and make man the same as He is in life and in nature but not in His Godhead
God predestinated us, marked us out, before the foundation of the world that we could be made His sons according to His good pleasure
God has some plan to fulfill, and this plan is to have the church as the Body of Christ which consummates in the New Jerusalem
The good pleasure of God is to have us as His sons, and eventually, all these sons ultimately consummate the New Jerusalem
In view of His good pleasure to have many sons consummated as the New Jerusalem, He created man in a special way
God created man with a spirit for man to receive and contain Him that man may live by Him as man's life and everything
God created man in His image, with a human spirit, and with a sense of a purpose deeply implanted in man's heart
Now we want to see the way the God-man is born of God through regeneration, the first item of the organic salvation of Christ
Psalm 19 says that the heavens declare the glory of God and that without a voice heard, the creation still speaks
Paul said in Romans 1:20 that God's eternal power and divine characteristics can be seen by man through 's creation
Day by day we should not forget that we are children of God born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God
We are regenerated of God the Spirit to be spirits-gods belonging to the species of God to see and enter into the kingdom of God
God's good pleasure is to be one with man, to make Himself a man, and to make man Himself in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
He created man in His image making man His xerox copy second He created man with a human spirit and third He put eternity in mans heart
After His creation of man, God put man in front of the tree of life, but the way to the tree of life was closed due to man's fall
All of these saints in the line of the inner life never considered the Lord's shepherding a part of the Lord's organic salvation
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
The Lord told Nicodemus that unless he was regenerated he would not be able to see, or understand, the kingdom of God
In Song of Songs the Lord instructs His lover to go to the place where He pastures His sheep by following the footsteps of His flock
Later He also pastures His flock among the lilies that is among those who seek the Lord and live a life of trusting in God with a pure heart
In this appendix Christ came in resurrection to the apostles to charge Peter to feed the Lord's lambs and to shepherd His sheep
The churches are so weak because they are missing the vital groups with Christ as the Chief Shepherd and Overseer
Both the feeding and the shepherding are for the God-men's growth in the divine life of God for their daily salvation
Peter 2:2 says that the newborn babes desire the milk from God's word that they may grow unto salvation, the daily salvation
We need to be saved from such things as losing our temper, criticizing others, mistreating others, and even lying
Because they know the Lord and the truth, they should be strong members of the vital groups, but they hardly ever speak
All of us need to be under the organic feeding and shepherding of Christ and be one with Him to feed and shepherd others
Many of us know the term God-man, but we need to be able to give a clear portion in the New Testament where this God-man is mentioned
John 1 tells us that in the Word, which is God, is life, and this life is the light of men shining in the darkness
Whoever would receive this shining receives the life in the Word, and authority is given to him to be a child of God
In this sense, Adam was the son of God in image and likeness, but he had only the image of God without the life and nature of God
We are not only created by God but also born of God, so God is our real, genuine, Father, and we are His real, genuine, children
Dear saints, whatever our profession is, whether we are teachers or doctors, we should not forget that our status is that of a God-man
In His youth the Lord Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day to put off His flesh and sanctified unto the Lord
At the age of twelve He said to His parents, 'I must be in the things of My Father,' or, 'I must be in My Father's house'
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul told Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach different things other than the economy of God
The economy of God is His plan to distribute the unsearchable riches of Christ to people that the church may be produced
If you are in all these kinds of states and conditions, you have to be silent, because no one honors or appreciates you
He told Adam that He would come as the seed of woman to destroy Satan, but He did not come until four thousand years later
Matthew 3:13 through 4:11 reveals how the Lord began to live in His ministry, which commenced when He was thirty years old
When He became thirty, God established Him to carry out His ministry for the purpose of accomplishing God's eternal economy
The end and the ultimate issue of the sixty-six books of the Bible show us the conclusion of God's eternal economy
In the last two chapters of Revelation, which are the end of the entire Scriptures, is a holy city, the New Jerusalem
The Bible, especially the New Testament, has been studied, interpreted, and taught for nearly twenty centuries
We are standing on the shoulders of many who have gone before us and have seen many parts of the divine revelation
It is not a material, lifeless city but a corporate living person as the bride, having Christ, such a wonderful person, as her Husband
The section from the end of Matthew 3 through the beginning of Matthew 4 shows us how this God-man lived and ministered
Christ started His ministry when He became thirty years of age, the full age God required for anyone to serve Him
Moses' law did not help them to be righteous, so God had a new start by sending another man by the name of John
Jesus needed to be baptized because He became flesh, and the flesh, in the eyes of God, is good for nothing but death and burial
To bury such a dead person by baptism is the way of righteousness, not the way of the law with its statutes and ordinances
The opening of the heavens indicated that the significance of His baptism was accepted and sealed by the heavens
By anointing Him the Father declared something according to another source, the source of the Spirit of holiness, His divinity
God anointed Him and declared, particularly to the angels, that He was the Son of God according to His divinity
His anointing was based upon the Father's choosing and because of Christ's loving of righteousness and hating of lawlessness
Not many have seen that Christ was tempted by the devil under the leading of the Holy Spirit and under the arrangement of God
He was standing on His position as a man, and He did not want to do anything to show that He was the Son of God
It was under the leading of the Spirit of God that the first God-man was brought to be tempted by the devil for His test
In Gods economy He arranged to have an enemy a testing one who had been a cherub created by God appointed by God and even anointed by God
Some have said that John was a transitional person who was neither in the Old Testament nor in the New Testament, but this is wrong
The outcome of the law was that man was exposed to be sinful before the righteous God and no man of the flesh could be justified by God
The entire New Testament is the dispensation of grace, which is the dispensation of the gospel of Jesus Christ
The Israelites who were under the ministry of the law of Moses needed to repent because they were all practicing unrighteousness
The kingdom of God is of righteousness , and the kingdom of the heavens is particularly based upon righteousness
The Gospels show us that there were disciples of three parties those of John the Baptist those of the Pharisees and those of the Sadducees
Those of John the Baptist were a real test to the Pharisees and the Sadducees, so none of them dared to come to John
The New Testament begins with the thought of John's preaching, that is, that men of the flesh are good only for death and burial
In baptism there is the practice of burial into water and then a rising up from the water, signifying resurrection
Baptism is so powerful because Jesus joins the baptized ones to God to make them God in life and nature but not in the Godhead
John the Baptists ministry is to deal with our real situation which is that we are men of the flesh who are worthy only of death and burial
The righteous are also referred to in Matthew 10:41 and Luke 14:14, and the way of righteousness is spoken of in 2 Peter 2:21
The New Testament dispensation of grace is to produce the God-man living, and the God-man living is a life of righteousness
Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness
Of course, Romans 8:3 tells us that He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He was still in the flesh
In the previous message, we saw the definitions of the way of righteousness and the proper and righteous base of Jesus' baptism
Jesus received the baptism by John the Baptist, standing on the base of realizing that He was a man in the flesh
Especially the co-workers and elders need to realize that as a natural man in the flesh, we are good for nothing except death and burial
In this message we want to go on to see three definitions covering the three sections of the enemy's one temptation of the first God-man
The tempter, Satan, said to Him, 'If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread'
Satan's stratagem was to tempt Jesus to ignore His standing as a man and to assume His position as the Son of God
The Lord answered him by saying It is written Man shall not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God
The first God-man defeated His tempter by standing firmly in His position of a man and answering him by saying, 'Man shall not live
After passing through two years of training, the full-time trainees may feel that they are special when they return to their localities
They would announce to the congregation that a certain trainee has returned, and they would ask him to give a message
Many of the so-called healings in Pentecostalism are just for the purpose of making a show and are not genuine
In being tempted the Lord had at least three statuses: first He was a man, second a creature, and third the Son of God
Today we must realize first that we are a man of the flesh worthy of nothing and second that we are a creature
The enemy would tempt us to love the world by getting us to consider how successful the people in the world are, while we are nothing
In this message we want to see the temptations suffered by the Lord during His ministry and at the end of His ministry
Although the Lord passed through some other temptations, the principles are all covered by these three categories of temptations
The Herodians were the political party under King Herod for Roman imperialism, usurped by the Pharisees in tempting the first God-man
They do not believe that Christ died on the cross for our sins but that He died on the cross merely as a martyr
They tempted the first God-man by telling Him that among them there were seven brothers who married one woman consecutively
He taught them that God as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob is not the God of the dead, but of the living
Without the interpretation of the Lord Jesus, we could not see the light that this divine title indicates resurrection
He answered, ''You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind'
Their questions indicated that they were concerned about Roman imperialism, their Jewish belief, and their creed
He was saying that He was equal to God, and that offended the Jews, but it was prophesied by David in Psalm 110:1
We believe that the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man will come on the clouds of heaven to take the earth and possess it
The Lord's standing on the position of humanity was a strong weapon for Him to defeat Satan and the instrument usurped by Satan
Far we have seen the first Godmans living in His infancy in His youth and in His silence between the age of twelve and the age of thirty
Paul was given a thorn in the flesh because God was concerned that he would be proud because of the revelations he had seen
One former co-worker dared not say that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, because he said this would offend others
A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory'
Some of those who are as bruised reeds and smoking flax will be used by Christ to bring forth justice unto victory
When the Lord saw the crowds He was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd
Martha and Mary lost their brother Lazarus, but they still remained ignorant and that compelled the Lord to weep
The Lord did not have a place to lay His head, though the foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have roosts
The two sons of thunder, James and John, asked, 'Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them'?
The Greek word for model literally means 'a writing copy, an underwriting, used by students to trace letters and thereby learn to draw them'
We become the reproduction of the original writing copy, not a mere imitation of Him produced by taking Him as our outward model
In His crucifixion He prayed for those who were crucifying Him, that the Father would forgive them their sin of ignorance
Even in His suffering and dying, He extended His salvation to one of the criminals who were crucified with Him
Everything that the Lord Jesus did was in coordination with the Father who abode and worked in Him for the accomplishment of His economy
He was on this earth living a life totally for the manifestation of God to express God's attributes in His human virtues
Now that we have seen the living of Christ for His ministry, we want to go on to see His moving for His ministry
Today we are fighting for the kingdom of God and working for Christ, but we must remember that a dove is both our weapon and our instrument
God sent His Son to be a man with the intention to defeat Satan, but the Spirit of God led this One to be tempted by Satan
We may hear just one message, but the Spirit we receive of the Lord in this message by His speaking is not by measure
From that time onward, He was going about to do good and to heal all those who were being oppressed by the devil
For Christ to offer Himself to God to be crucified to accomplish redemption to bring us back to serve the living God was a great thing
That indicates that even He, Christ in the flesh, was suffering something that was not so easy for His humanity
He realized the need of the strengthening of the Spirit, so He offered Himself, including His humanity, to God through the eternal Spirit
In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the first God-man's living by seeing Him as a man of prayer
His being a man of prayer was not even as merely a Christ-seeker praying desperately to gain Christ in His excellency
On the one hand, Jesus was a man in the flesh, yet He prayed to the mysterious God in the divine and mystical way and realm
Peter 2:23b says that in the midst of His suffering He did not speak threatening words but kept committing all to Him who judges righteously
In the Lord Jesus, Satan as the ruler of the world had no ground, no chance, no hope, no possibility in anything
Our classmates, colleagues, or peers should sense that there is something about us that they cannot understand
The One who prayed the prayer recorded in John 17 was Jesus of Nazareth, a man in the flesh, yet His prayer was mystical
A sister who lost her son once said she could not understand why it was that the more she loved the Lord, the more she seemed to lose
We want to see the divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels
He should have felt that His Father's divine commission to Him concerning the kingdom of the heavens was a great and critical burden to Him
He needed to seek His Father's counsel concerning how to bring His Father's kingdom in the heavens to the fallen Adamic race on the earth
There is no mention of prayer accompanying the first God-man's fasting, not only in forty days but also in forty nights
Even those who are close to us should be able to sense that there is something about us which is mysterious and cannot be understood
Sometimes when we hear a young sister giving a testimony, we have the sense that her speaking is divine yet mystical
When people saw what He did, they were astounded and said, 'Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?
We want to continue to see the divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man, who was a man of prayer
The praying ones must be children of God, born of God, so they have the authority, the right, to call God their Father
Romans 14:17 tells us that the reality of the kingdom life is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
In the United Nations, peace is talked about all the time, but there is no peace, because there is no righteousness
In his second Epistle, Peter tells us that the unique thing that dwells in the new heavens and new earth is righteousness
The name is of the Father, because the Father is the source; the kingdom is of the Son, and the will is of the Spirit
To pray in this way is to pray that the Triune God will be prevailing on the earth as He is prevailing in the heavens
The Lord's prayer takes care of the Triune God, of our daily necessity, of our relationship with God and with others, and also of Satan
The prayer taught by the Lord in His supreme teaching begins with God the Father and ends also with God the Father
They love to make a show publicly that they may be seen by men and receive glory from them according to the lust of their fleshly desire
We should pray in our private place to be seen by the Father in secret, not by others for an outward public display
The disciples should not pray as the Gentiles do, babbling empty words, supposing that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard
Some have accused us by saying that our pray-reading of the Word is repetitious, but pray-reading is spiritual breathing
His disciples should not fast like the sullen-faced hypocrites, disfiguring their faces that their fast may appear to men
Now we want to consider the second time the Lord taught the disciples concerning prayer in His supreme teaching on the mount
The Lord said, 'Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you'
The Lord promised us that if we ask, we will receive; if we seek, we will find; and if we knock, it will be opened to us
If we ask, seek, and knock, we will enter into all the blessings in the kingdom of the heavens for our supreme and strict kingdom life
We must remember that we are still looking at the divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man
Whatever God does is a divine fact, and the divine facts were lived in a human life, making that human life mystical
We know this because of the parallel record in Luke 6:12-18, which says that the Lord spent the whole night in prayer
The next day He established the twelve apostles to visit and take care of the people who were troubled by unclean spirits and heal them
The Lord went to the mountain completely apart from human society to contact His Father in prayer, and He prayed the whole night
While the first God-man was rebuking the cities, He fellowshipped with the Father, answering the Father by His prayer
In the Gospel of John, the Lord said repeatedly that all the ones who come to Him and believe in Him were given to Him by the Father
The Greek word for easy means 'fit for use'; hence, good, kind, mild, gentle, easy, pleasant-in contrast to hard, harsh, sharp, bitter
All the elect given to the Son by the Father are the enlargement of Christ and the organism of the Triune God to express Him
In the Father, He has chosen us; in the Son, He has redeemed us; and in the Spirit, He seals us and is our guarantee
The economy of the Triune God is for Him to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people to make them His expression
The Triune God's economy was made according to His purpose for His good pleasure, and His good pleasure comes out of His heart's desire
Christ was God becoming a man, and this man who was in the flesh, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit
The New Testament teaches us, the members of the Body of Christ, to do everything with God, in God, by God, and through God
The Father has hidden all the things as the contents of His economy from the wise and the intelligent-the worldlings
The Lord said, 'Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens'
If we are wise and intelligent and not as children, there is no hope for us to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
The Greek word for model is literally a writing copy, an underwriting used by students to trace letters and thereby learn to draw them
The believers copy the Lord in their spirit by taking His yoke-God's will-and toiling for God's economy according to His model
In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning the Lord's pattern as a man of prayer in the record of Matthew
In the performing of the miracle of feeding five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, He trained His disciples to learn from Him
In Matthew 11:29 the Lord told the disciples that they needed to learn from Him, indicating that He was their pattern
Matthew 14:19 says that He took the five loaves and two fish and when He was going to bless them, He looked up to heaven
Most readers of the Bible would pay attention to the miracle of creating something from nothing performed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 14
We need to remember that He looked up to the Father in heaven and blessed the five loaves and two fish in front of His disciples
A co-worker who is invited to speak somewhere may think that since he has been speaking for the Lord for many years, he knows how to speak
The learned professors in the universities do many things in order to attract people's attention, displaying what they know and can do
We should deny ourselves and not have the intention of doing anything from ourselves but have the intention of doing everything from Him
All of us should be on the alert for this one thing-when we are sent to do some work, we should not take that chance to seek our own goal
You may take your visit to them as a chance for you to accomplish your purpose instead of seeking the Lord's will
We should only know to labor, to work for Him, by denying our self, rejecting our purpose, and giving up our ambition
If we go to a certain place and have a great success, would we leave right away or would we remain in this big success to enjoy it?
Even the Lord Jesus told us that when we pray we should shut our door privately and pray secretly to the Father who sees in secret
We have to learn to leave the crowds, our family, our friends, and the saints in the church to go to a higher level on a 'high mountain'
We need to get to a higher level separated from the crowd to be with the Father privately and secretly to have intimate fellowship with Him
The Lord told the ones whom He fed not to seek the food that perishes, but to seek the food that abides unto eternal life
To see all the detailed points concerning the lessons of life to learn from the Lord in His way of performing the miracle imparts life to us
The Bible shows us clearly that there are two kinds of angels: the good angels standing with God and the bad ones following Satan
In Revelation 12 Satan is likened to a great red dragon whose tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven
Even in the church, disorder appears, so according to the New Testament teaching the Lord Jesus set up a model to keep a good order
In the early years in China among us, there were a number of cases of casting out demons, but not in recent years
Matthew 18:15-22 describes the case of a brother who is disobedient first to someone who wants to shepherd him
We have to bind with the authority of the heavens by two or three coming together in the principle of the Body, not by ourselves
Whatever we say in binding a rebellious one must be like music to God and also to the enemy Satan for him to be defeated
According to the context of these verses, the offending one might be the disobedient one in the previous section
The Lord said that if we are going to forgive a disobedient brother, we have to forgive him seventy times seven, that is, 490 times
The more we live in the kingdom, the less we feel that some have offended us, even though they may have done many wrong things to us
People brought their children to the Lord that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but His disciples rebuked them
For the disciples to rebuke the children coming to the Lord indicates that they felt that they were mature and special
We should never reject the weaker ones, the fallen ones, the mistaken and backsliding ones, or the ones whom we feel are not growing
All these points are very instructive and show us how we should deal with people and be among them for the Lord's interests
All the prayers offered by the Lord in Matthew, Mark, and Luke-the synoptic Gospels-were made by Christ in His humanity
In cursing the fig tree so that it instantly dried up, the first God-man taught His disciples how to pray by faith
The first God-man's teaching here was according to God's will to be accomplished for the fulfillment of His economy
Not many see that the Lords teaching on prayer is related to Gods economy which is to be accomplished by His faithful people doing His will
Israel disappointed God in this matter, so God came to the church, hoping that the church would be His organism
It is to take care of the producing and building up of God's organism, which is the Body of Christ that will consummate the New Jerusalem
Based upon this background, the first God-man taught His disciples to pray for executing God's will according to His economy by faith
The praying one could have faith in God without doubting, but believing that he had received what he asked for, and he would have it
In Mark 11:24 the Lord said, 'All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them'
Soon after the United States defeated Iraq in 1991, one day a thought came to me: 'Why don't you go to Russia?
The brothers have estimated that by the end of this year, there will be fifty well-established churches in Russia
Besides Russia, the Lord has been moving in other eastern European countries, such as Poland, Albania, Romania, and Armenia
The second testimony is concerning my experience of the Lord in 1943, which was a critical year of the war between China and Japan
There were eight years of fighting between Japan and China, and the last four years, after America joined the war, became very hard
By His mercy and grace, we can boast that today on this whole earth, all the churches, the co-workers, and the elders are in harmony
We can have God as our faith and pray according to our knowledge of God's will for the fulfillment of His economy
In prophesying that the returned Israel in the future will suffer the great tribulation, the first God-man taught them how to flee by prayer
At the end of this age, because of Antichrist, a great tribulation will occur in the holy land, so Israel will suffer
We must also be one with God so that we can believe that the very God to whom we pray controls the weather and rules the world situation
After the Feast of the Passover, He taught His disciples how to remember Him by breaking the bread and drinking the cup
At the end of that feast, He established the Lord's table to remember Him by breaking the bread and drinking the cup
In His humanity such suffering was nearly unbearable, yet He prayed for the Father's will, not His will, to be done
He said that as the sent One, He was not alone, because the Sender, His Father, was with Him all the time in His divinity
We will cover the Lord's prayer in John 17 in the Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John, in the upcoming summer training
Many readers of the Bible feel that in studying the four Gospels, the easiest thing to study is Christ's prayer
In this message we will conclude our fellowship concerning the God-man living, specifically concerning Christ as a man of prayer
Among other things, we want to consider the Lord's prayer on the cross in which He said, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
God the Father was with Him all the time, but when He was dying on the cross, He cried, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
We want to emphasize that we are still fellowshipping concerning the divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man
We have been baptized in one Spirit into this one Body , and God has placed us and blended us together in this one mystical Body
All the genuine prayers, real prayers, prayers that can be counted by God, are divine facts in the mystical human life
Watching and praying is a very strong principle in our Christian life because the tempter, Satan, is always around us
While the disciples were sleeping, the Lord was fighting in His prayer, even to the extent of sweating with drops like blood
They did not keep the Lord's word, because they were weak in their flesh even though they were willing in their spirit
While the persecutors were crucifying Him, He asked the Father to forgive them because they did not know what they were doing
Christ prayed asking the Father to forgive those people who were crucifying Him in His humanity with the divine power of the eternal Spirit
To pray for the forgiveness of those who were crucifying Him was not an easy thing, but He did it in His humanity with the divine power
In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God's will; in the last three hours He was judged by God for our sins
Eventually, They work to bring us into Them, that is, into the union, mingling, and incorporation with the Triune God
In Matthew and Luke, the synoptic Gospels, when Christ was being baptized, He stood in the water on earth praying
When He was crucified to death, He did not die in His divinity, but He was killed in His humanity for our sins
At that juncture, He needed an angel to strengthen Him , needless to say that He needed the Spirit to support Him
We need to see that the prayers made by Christ in the synoptic Gospels were made by Him in His humanity with His divinity
John 17 shows us how Christ prayed that His believers would practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity as the Divine Trinity does
