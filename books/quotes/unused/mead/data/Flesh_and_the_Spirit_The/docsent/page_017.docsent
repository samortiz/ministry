   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST INTERCEDING FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must see that Christ became two things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He became the flesh to crush the flesh and to condemn sin in the flesh, and He became the Spirit to indwell us and become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans also reveals that Christ is the One who is interceding in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 8:34 says, "It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He became flesh to condemn sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the One who is now here indwelling us and giving life to us, He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the One who is interceding for us, pleading for us in the heavenly court, He is in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are the three major points concerning Christ in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 3 of chapter eight, He was on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 10 He is now in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 34 while He is here imparting life, He is in the third heaven interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need Him to become flesh; we need Him to be the Spirit; and we need Him interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have an all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He crushed our flesh and condemned sin in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He became the Spirit to impart Himself as life to us, to indwell our spirit, and to strengthen our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Also, for fulfilling God's economy, He needs to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is now interceding for us in the heavenly administrative office as the very Paraclete 1 John 2:1; Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ went to the cross, and we went with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He came out of the tomb in resurrection, and so did we.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is now in resurrection, and so are we Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today He is in our spirit, and we are walking according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While we are walking according to the spirit, He is interceding for us at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The bountiful issue of this is that we will get the help from the flesh but not be bothered by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will be absolutely in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are in our spirit, we are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jacob had a dream in which he saw a ladder set up on earth, the top of which reached to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The angels of God were ascending and descending on this ladder Gen 28:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he woke up, he said, "This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" v. 17 . He called the name of that place Bethel, which means the house of God v. 19 . According to Ephesians 2:22, our spirit today is the real Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our spirit is also the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we turn to our spirit, we are in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hebrews tells us that we have to come forward to the throne of grace 4:16 and enter into the Holy of Holies 10:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The throne of grace and the Holy of Holies are in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can we enter into heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We just need to get into our spirit; then we are in heaven because our spirit is the gate of heaven, the entry of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you get into the spirit, you are in the Holy of Holies.</S>
