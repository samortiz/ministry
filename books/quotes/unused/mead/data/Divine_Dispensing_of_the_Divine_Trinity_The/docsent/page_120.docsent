   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN A LOCAL CHURCH 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:9, 30; 2:10-13; 3:6-7, 9, 12; 15:45b; 6:17; 12:3-6, 13</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may read the Epistle of 1 Corinthians many times without understanding it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult to touch the essence of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE ESSENCE OF FIRST CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To help our understanding, we may compare the essence of 1 Corinthians to the essence of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A tree has a trunk, branches, and leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These, however, are not the essence, or the extract, of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, we may know the element and substance of a tree and still not yet know its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The essence of a tree is its extract.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as we may see the trunk, branches, and leaves without knowing the essence of a tree, so we may see the trunk, branches, and leaves of 1 Corinthians, but not be able to see the essence, the extract, of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>More than fifty years ago I made an outline of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I reviewed that outline years later, I realized that I had touched only the branches and leaves of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I had not yet touched the element or substance, much less the essence, of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may think that there is no difference between the substance of a thing and its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But from the study of the Bible and the writings of certain great teachers, we have learned that there is a very important difference between substance and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may touch the substance of a particular matter without touching its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only when you touch the essence of a thing can you have the extract of that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First we have the element, then the substance, and finally the essence, the extract.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these messages we are endeavoring to touch the essence of Paul s word in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us now consider the extract of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CALLED INTO THE FELLOWSHIP OF GOD S SON</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND PUT INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1:9 Paul says, God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has called us into the partaking of, the participation in, His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has called us to partake of the all-inclusive Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son means that He has called us into the enjoyment of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has called us into the enjoyment of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This enjoyment is not merely an individual matter; it is also a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has called us into the co-participation of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order that we may enjoy Christ, God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is not only a sphere; He is also an element, substance, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has put us into this element, substance, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as something may be put into water and then soak in the water, we have been put into Christ so that we may soak in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After putting us into Christ, God has made Christ His power and wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to 1:24, Christ is God s power and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For Christ to become wisdom and power to us actually means that He is dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This dispensing can be compared to the flow of electricity from the power plant into the appliances in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This flowing of the electricity is the dispensing of the electricity into the appliances.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that God has called us into the participation of the enjoyment of Christ, the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this purpose, He has put us into this electricity and now is making this electricity our wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
