   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 14:7-11 says, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these verses the Lord clearly reveals to us the mystery that He and the Father are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is in the Father and the Father is in Him; when He speaks, it is the Father who works; when men see Him, they see the Father; when they know Him, they know the Father, because He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Scriptures also reveal that the Son the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There can never be another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord was made flesh and became the last Adam, and later, after death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The words spoken by the Lord in John 14:16-20 confirm this point.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the Lord tells us that He will pass through death and resurrection to become another Comforter, that is, the Spirit of reality, who will come to abide with us and dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 17 the Lord said concerning the Spirit of reality: "He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then in verse 18 He says, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The very "He" who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very "I" who is the Lord Himself in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord said in effect, "When He comes, I come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is I; I am He."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus, and the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, in verse 17 the Lord said, "The Spirit of reality...shall be in you," and then in verse 20 He says, "I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This also proves that the Holy Spirit who is in us is the Lord who died and rose and now lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord spoken of here, of course, is the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse tells us clearly and definitely that our Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the Father and He is the Spirit, the very God and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This clearly shows that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, not three; They are distinct but not separate.</S>
