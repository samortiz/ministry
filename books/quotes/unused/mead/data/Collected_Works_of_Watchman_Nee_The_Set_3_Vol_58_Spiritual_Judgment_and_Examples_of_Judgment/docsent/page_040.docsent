   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Stricken Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christianity is not about changing the mind or the emotion; it has to do with the purifying of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me illustrate my point this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A naughty boy may be severely punished by his father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At first he may think that the father has been too harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But later he will think that his father loves him and that he was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his mind he knows that he should be punished, and in his emotion he realizes that his father punishes him out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But these feelings only reach as far as the emotion and the mind; they have not produced a stricken spirit in him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they have produced a stricken spirit in him, he will be sober after he has been punished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He will no longer make noise at the dinner table, and he will no longer be naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will no longer be rowdy in his bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead he will calm down.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He will feel ashamed of the things he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the expression of a stricken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can say that he has the mark of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our service to the Lord, God deals with us in such a way that our mind and emotion are touched and our feelings before God are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in His dealing, something is seared into our spirit so that our spirit is stricken as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The pain, the shame, and fear that we bear at the time of being stricken remain fresh in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone who has passed through the cross has a mark on him, the mark of a stricken spirit, which remains in him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can no longer be careless or jovial but bears a wound with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only such ones can impart life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every time we suffer, it is for the purpose of producing a stricken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Take the example of the child that we spoke of earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When his spirit becomes haughty and loose again, he will suffer another chastisement from his father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every time we are chastised by God, we should end up with a chastised spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is how our spirit is purified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that we will no longer speak to our Father or that we will no longer dare to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It means that our spirit will become different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Naughtiness, looseness, and carelessness are marks of rawness in man; they are reflections of his original state.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a one has to pass through the fire before he is "cooked."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a mark with those who have a stricken spirit they become fearful of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They bear a spirit of fear within them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are not only changed in their attitude, words, emotions, and thoughts, but they bear the expression of chastisement in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such an expression is demonstrated through their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who have a stricken spirit simply have it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When others touch it, they know it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who do not have the scar of the cross do not have it, and others know it; no one can fake this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We encounter sufferings and chastisements all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would be a pity if these do not produce a stricken spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every time God sends us suffering, it is for the purpose of producing a stricken spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this is not produced in us, we are wasting our time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the way of the cross, and this is the way to spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the Lord resurrected, He allowed Thomas to touch the wound in His hand and His side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we are wounded by the cross, we also should have clear marks of the cross in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way to be delivered from rawness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Daily we should live in this spirit of chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a spirit will keep us from acting rashly or speaking carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person with such a spirit will come to God in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He will no longer be rough and coarse; he will become tender.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our brother has to have a purified spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord has done a great work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has suffered over ten years, from 1936 to 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he has not learned the lessons, he has wasted all this time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have been too frank with you, but I cannot hide anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not replace the fruit of the spirit with the works of the emotion and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The spirit should not be entangled or polluted by the emotion and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It should be fearful, disciplined, and careful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I feel that your spirit has been too free.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It should bear the mark of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In your speaking and praying, you should have the scar of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A loose spirit is raw and cannot edify others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A rubber tree that has not been cut cannot supply others with its sap.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A man who has not passed through the cross cannot bring others into the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A raw person cannot participate in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only those who have been made mature by God can lead others into the reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During the past few days I have been a little impatient because I have seen many people who have been stricken but they have not received much spiritual benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that as the days go by, a stricken spirit will be found in you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are no longer young.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot waste the Lord's time any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every time we experience trials and sufferings, we have to produce abundant results.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not take care of this, we will be of little use to the Lord.</S>
