   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You are not under the law but under grace Rom 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>New Testament believers are not under law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we should not return to the law to live under the law and to keep the letter of the ordinances of the law.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have died through Christ to the law, so we have been discharged from the law to serve the Lord in newness of spirit, not in oldness of letter.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must serve the Lord according to the Spirit and the life in our spirit to live under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we should not care for the letter of the law but only for the Spirit and life in the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The law is a child-conductor to lead us to Christ so that we may live under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we have entered into Christ and are under grace, we are no longer under the child-conductor, so we should not live under the law.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them Heb 8:10; see also 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although believers are not under the law, this does not mean that they are not under any restrictions and can be completely lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although God s salvation frees believers from an outward observation of the law of letters, He puts the law of life into the believers and inscribes it on their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The outward law of letters is composed of ordinances apart from God and separate from God.</S>

   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Holy Spirit enters into us and brings God s life into us as an inward law.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since this life is in the Holy Spirit, the law of this life is also in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, the law of life is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This inward law is active and keen; it has the capacity to regulate us in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It causes us to know God s will and enables us to live out God s will in a living and strong way.</S>
