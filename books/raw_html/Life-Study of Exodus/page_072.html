<h2 class="head1">III. MAN&rsquo;S FREE WILL</h2><p>In the universe there are three things that cannot be denied: God&rsquo;s sovereignty, God&rsquo;s mercy, and man&rsquo;s free will. God&rsquo;s sovereignty and mercy are both divine and eternal, without beginning or ending. Man&rsquo;s free will, on the contrary, is something created by God. In creating man with a free will, God displayed His greatness. Because He is great, He does not force us to choose Him. Rather, He leaves us free to make our own choice.</p><p>The fact that God granted man a free choice also reveals His wisdom and love. No one who is great, wise, and loving compels others to do things. Instead, such a person will always respect the free will of others and say, &ldquo;The choice is yours. If you want to do this, you may choose to do so. You must make the decision.&rdquo; Whether we take God or reject Him is a matter of our choice. Genesis 2 proves that man has a free will. According to this chapter, God placed the man created by Him in front of two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and man was free to choose between them. When I was young, I thought God was mistaken in allowing the second tree to be in the garden. It seemed to me that if there had been only one tree, the tree of life, there could have been no problem. But in His greatness, wisdom, and love, God gave man the opportunity to choose Him by placing him in front of two trees.</p><p>According to Genesis 3, Eve deliberately chose to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. In making this decision, she exercised her discernment and free will. In the same principle, we must decide whether or not to believe in the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, after receiving Him, we must choose whether or not we shall seek Him. Some may think that the situation in the universe would be wonderful if Satan did not exist. Nevertheless, it is a fact that both God and Satan, both life and death, are present and we must choose between them.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. PHARAOH&rsquo;S HARDENING OF HIS HEART</h2><p>With this as the background, we come to the problem of the hardening of Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart. Did God firstly harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, or did Pharaoh take the first step to harden his own heart? As a help in answering this question, consider your experience in believing in the Lord Jesus. Was this initiated by you or by God? Surely it was initiated by God. However, you did the believing. Before I was saved, I had no thought of God. My believing in Christ was neither planned nor initiated by me. I have the full assurance that the source of this was God Himself. He planned it, initiated it, and scheduled it. Before I was saved, I was not willing to believe in Christ. However, one day I spontaneously became willing. According to my experience and yours as well, God took the first step to cause us to believe in Christ.</p><p>In the same principle, God took the first step in the hardening of Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart. Before Moses had his first confrontation with Pharaoh, God told him that He would harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart (4:21). However, in the case of our salvation, God initiated our believing in the Lord Jesus, but He did not execute it by believing for us. God planned that we should believe, but we ourselves had to believe. Likewise, God firstly hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, then Pharaoh carried out this hardening through his own free will.</p><p>Here we see God&rsquo;s sovereignty and man&rsquo;s free will. Instead of being contradictory, these two correspond. Pharaoh could not escape responsibility in this matter and place it all on God. He had his own free will.</p><p>On the one hand, we must worship God for His sovereignty, but, on the other hand, we must fulfill our responsibility. God&rsquo;s sovereignty does not contradict our free will, and our free will does not contradict His sovereignty. If we see this, we shall humble ourselves under God&rsquo;s sovereignty and spontaneously take up our responsibility. We shall say, &ldquo;Lord, everything is according to Your sovereignty. Nevertheless, I must carry out my responsibility.&rdquo; The more we are willing to bear our responsibility, the stronger is the sign that we have been predestinated by God.</p><p>The Bible firstly says that God hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart. But the Bible also says that Pharaoh hardened his heart. This shows both God&rsquo;s sovereignty and man&rsquo;s free will. We must always humble ourselves and say, &ldquo;Lord, You are sovereign. But I must still carry out my responsibility.&rdquo; This attitude indicates that we are favored by God. Suppose, however, that we have the attitude that because everything is according to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, we are not responsible to do anything. This is a sign that we have denied God. Pharaoh could not absolve himself of responsibility, and Moses could not boast of his deeds. In this way, God shut every mouth. Moses had no room to boast. Neither did Pharaoh have an excuse not to bear responsibility.</p><p>God&rsquo;s sovereignty and our responsibility are both involved in our spiritual seeking. All proper spiritual seeking is planned and scheduled by God. But we are still responsible to seek the Lord. When we seek Him, we should not be proud. Rather, we should humble ourselves and confess that our seeking of the Lord is according to His sovereignty. At the same time, we fulfill our responsibility. If we are indifferent toward the Lord, we are in danger of not fulfilling our responsibility. But if we are zealous in pursuing the Lord, we must be careful not to boast of our spiritual seeking. Once again we see that we need to humble ourselves under God&rsquo;s sovereignty and, at the same time, carry out our responsibility. If we are conscious of God&rsquo;s sovereignty and our responsibility, we are truly favored by God.</p><p>We have pointed out that some verses say that God hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, whereas other verses say that God made Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart hard. In the same principle, in some places we are told that Pharaoh hardened his heart (8:15, 19) but elsewhere, that Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart was hard (7:13, Heb.). There is a difference between hardening the heart and the heart becoming hard. In Exodus we are told both that Pharaoh hardened his heart and that his heart became hard. This indicates that Pharaoh firstly hardened his heart. The result was that his heart became hard. Hence, the heart being hard was the consequence of the hardening of the heart. Before Pharaoh hardened his heart, it was still possible for his heart to be softened. But instead of softening his heart, Pharaoh hardened it. The same is true today. Before a person hardens his heart, his heart is not hard. To some extent at least, it is soft. But once he decides to harden his heart, his heart becomes hard.</p><p>We can learn an important lesson from this: Never allow anything negative to develop toward the Lord. Before this negative thing arises, you still have two choices&mdash;to be for God or to be against Him. But once something negative comes forth and your heart is hardened, you will have only one choice, and that is to reject God.</p><p>From the way Pharaoh dealt with his heart we can see how God dealt with Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart. Firstly, God hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and then He made his heart hard. After God had hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, He could have softened it. However, He did not do so. Instead, He kept Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart in a hardened condition. This means that God made Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart hard. In the beginning, God hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart; then He made Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart hard. In other words, God did not intervene to change what He had done to Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>If we allow something negative to develop toward the Lord, there will be a serious issue. God may not change this result. Rather, He may allow it to continue, just as He did not show mercy to Pharaoh, but let him stand by himself in order to show forth His power in him (Rom. 9:17). Once you harden your heart, your heart will become hard and remain hard. This is on your side. On God&rsquo;s side, He firstly hardens your heart and then He may refuse to change what He has done. Firstly, He hardens the heart and then He keeps it hard. This warns us to take heed lest any negative thing arise within us. Once this negative thing produces a particular result, that result will remain. It may be that not even God Himself will change it. He may allow it to remain as it is.</p><p>I believe Moses used various expressions to describe the hardening of Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart so that we might learn to humble ourselves before God&rsquo;s sovereignty, to take up our responsibility, and to guard ourselves from allowing negative things to develop toward God. Once these things develop, it is very difficult to change the result they cause. Instead, the condition remains and may even worsen. Let us learn from the example of Pharaoh. He allowed something evil to begin, and the result remained permanently. What a serious warning this is!</p><p>Throughout the years, I have seen many cases of those who allowed negative things to develop. At first, there were two choices in front of them, and it was still possible for them to change their direction. But once they made the negative choice, there was no turning back. From that time onward, there was no change of the condition or the consequence resulting from their choice.</p><p>Be careful of any negative thing rising up. Never regard such a thing as insignificant. Do not say to yourself that you will do a certain thing and change later. You may desire to change, but the result of your choice may not allow you to change. Furthermore, God may not have the intention to change such a negative situation.</p><p>We need to worship God for His sovereignty, thank Him for His mercy, carry out our responsibility, and keep negative things from arising between us and the Lord. Then we shall be in God&rsquo;s favor, a Moses, not a Pharaoh. We need to look to the Lord that we may be not vessels of wrath like Pharaoh, but, like Moses, vessels of mercy and honor unto glory.</p>
