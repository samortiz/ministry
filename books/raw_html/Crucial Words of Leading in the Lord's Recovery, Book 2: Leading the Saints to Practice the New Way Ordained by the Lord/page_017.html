 <h2 class="head2">After Morning Revival,<br />
Calling on the Lord and Enjoying the Lord<br />
as the New Portion in His Word</h2>
<p>Psalm 119:147-148 speaks of a seeker of the Lord rising up, seeking Him, and having fellowship with the Lord in His word before the night watches. Lamentations 3 also says that God&rsquo;s grace, compassions, lovingkindness, and presence are new every morning and that we should enjoy Him as our portion (vv. 22-24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing to the Lord and<br />
Receiving the Infilling of the Spirit</h2>
<p>In our living, we need to confess our sins to the Lord and receive the infilling of the Spirit (1 John 1:9; Acts 13:52).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking according to the Spirit<br />
to Live Christ</h2>
<p>Moreover, in our daily life we need to walk according to the spirit in order to magnify Christ and live Christ (Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:20-21a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying Unceasingly&mdash;<br />
Calling on the Lord Unceasingly</h2>
<p>Christians often ask, &ldquo;How can we pray unceasingly?&rdquo; To pray unceasingly is to call on the Lord without ceasing. We can pray unceasingly by calling on the Lord unceasingly, regardless of time, place, or what person or matter we are facing (1 Thes. 5:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching Christ<br />
in Season and out of Season</h2>
<p>We should not be so spiritual as to think that when we preach Christ, we need to consider whether or not it is the opportune time; this is not right. Paul says, &ldquo;Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). This means that regardless of what time it is, we can speak of the Lord and preach Him to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Diligent to Meet Together</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Relying on the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit<br />
and the Empowering of the Lord</h2>
<p>If we desire to fulfill the aforementioned points, we cannot do so by ourselves. We can do so only by the bountiful supply of the Spirit and the empowering of the Lord (Phil. 1:19; 4:13).</p>
<p>The purpose of this fellowship is to pour out my concern; I hope that all of us will realize that this is a critical moment. May the Lord be merciful to us and cause us to have a reconsideration and a new beginning. We truly do not desire to be the same as before but seek to advance according to the new way.</p>
