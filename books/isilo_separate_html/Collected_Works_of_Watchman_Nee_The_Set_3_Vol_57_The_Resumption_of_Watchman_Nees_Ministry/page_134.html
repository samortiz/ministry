No matter how large a number we have, when this number is compared with the whole, it is worth nothing. The question is whether or not we are the same as all the other children of God. If we are, we can say that we are the church. If not, even if we have sixteen hundred people, we cannot say that we are the church. When a man is in the Holy Spirit, he can be one with the church. When a man is not in the Holy Spirit, there is no oneness of the church. If there is no oneness of the church, even if the number is ten times sixteen hundred, there is still no church.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Dealt With to Have the Body Consciousness,<br />and Being Identified with the Body</h2><p>God wants our self to be broken. Individualism must go, and we cannot act according to our own will; our outward shell must be broken. The Body is a matter of consciousness. God has to bring a man to the point where he realizes that he is the church. This is what we mean by the Body consciousness. One has to be brought to the point where he feels that he is the Body. When one member of your body moves, the whole body moves as well. This is something very real. The Lord said to Paul, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads'' (Acts 26:14). Perhaps Paul only remembered that he persecuted Stephen. He did not realize that while he was persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord. Later, he understood that in persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord. This is why Paul later said that when one member suffers, the whole Body suffers (1 Cor. 12:26). When the whole Body is rejoicing, will not each member rejoice? When the whole Body is suffering, will not each member suffer also? We have to stand on the ground of a receiving one, and we should receive the other members of the Body. Pride goes before destruction (Prov. 16:18). Those who sit on the high chair of a judge can surely not be runners of the race. Only those who receive, who are humble, and who step down from their throne can identify themselves with others and with the church. Otherwise, any oneness is but an outward performance.</p><p>When a man is one with the church, if others are in the flow, he will surely be in the flow. When others receive a certain guidance, he will receive the same guidance. All the brothers and sisters will receive the same grace and take the same way. If everyone is hot, and you are the only one that is cold, it proves that you are not in the Body. If everyone is going in one direction, you have to follow them. If everyone is burdened for Manchuria, spontaneously you will have the same burden. If everyone is afraid of touching a certain matter, you will not dare to touch the same matter. This is the church. The church is something that issues from within. It is not something that is arrived at by outward consensus. Hence, every child of God is the church. If we follow the footsteps of the flock in this way, God will lead us on. We cannot withdraw ourselves simply because of our unwillingness to submit in certain matters, and we cannot fall behind or draw back. Among God's children the most precious thing is this sense of identification. If all God's children see something one way and I feel another way, I should resolve not to fall behind the others, and I should be ready to identify myself with others.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_133.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_135.html">Next</a> </body></html>
