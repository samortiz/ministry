   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT WE ARE AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The matter that I discussed with our dear brother is not a question of who we are but of where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was not a question of whether we are the church but of what ground we are on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are we on the ground of the Catholic Church or of the Protestant churches?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are we on the ground of the various denominations or on the ground of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the case of the children of Israel, it was not a question of whether they were God s people but of where they were.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Were they in Babylon or Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Were they in the wilderness of Arabia or in the land of Assyria or Samaria?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I deeply sense that among those who stood up to speak for God in the past several centuries, too many knew only who they were.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hardly anyone who has stood up to speak for God has genuinely asked this one question on God s behalf: Where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the Lord has been merciful to us and led us into His recovery, we should always focus on this central question: Where are we?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout the ages God has recovered much, but there is still one matter that has yet to be recovered, that is, the matter of Where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The recovery of this matter began among us almost thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, we must continue to ask, Where are we?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not sufficient merely to do things correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will be right only when we are in the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sadly, until today, those who are saved by God focus only on what they are, but they neglect, or even greatly oppose, the matter of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some who have much spiritual knowledge strongly oppose, blame, and condemn us concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is most grievous to our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A subtle scheme of the enemy is to undermine the recovery through men who are very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This scheme of Satan is able to come in through almost anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one is so spiritual that he cannot be used by Satan to damage the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is able to use any spiritual matter or any matter of faith as a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, at this critical juncture, we need to consider this matter clearly and carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although what we have encountered and heard may cause us to feel troubled, we cannot let ourselves be easily shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past thirty years we have paid a great price and suffered innumerable attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have been slandered and reproached many times because of our desire to maintain the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We feel that we should not only refuse to accept any kind of erroneous influence; much more, we should even rise up and cry out concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should devote our whole being to this task until we go to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have no desire to speak on any other topic than the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The truth concerning the cross has been recovered and adequately preached, and the truth concerning resurrection has also been clearly and sufficiently preached.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the matter of the ground of the church has not been adequately preached.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What God is doing is practical and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks once said that since God was unable to get what He was after in the West, He came to the East.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I truly say Amen and hope that Brother Sparks will also apply this principle to the matter of the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God raised up some people in the West who are willing to take the way of recovery; however, over the past six months the matter of the ground has been damaged by much action, work, and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, people in the West avoid speaking of this matter and consider it a shame to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If someone were to ask about it, he would be regarded as being the same as the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My point is that God has had no way in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, He was merciful to us by coming to the East.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, in the past thirty years it seems that we have not cared for any other matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the time of Martin Luther it seemed that he did not care about any matter other than justification by faith; however, we know that this is not true and that he did care about other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the reason people have an inaccurate impression is that Martin Luther emphasized the main point that God was recovering through him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps he could have discarded all other points, but God would not let him discard this one point.</S>
