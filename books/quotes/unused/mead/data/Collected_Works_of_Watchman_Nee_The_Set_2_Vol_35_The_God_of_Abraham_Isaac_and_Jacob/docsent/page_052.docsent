   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BACK TO CANAAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Esau returned to Seir, and Jacob set off to Succoth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city" v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Remaining in Shechem</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God wanted Jacob to go back to his father's land, but he remained in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Shechem was only the first stop on the way to Canaan, yet Jacob dwelt in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, he built a house in Succoth v. 17 . Then he bought a parcel of a field, spread his tent, and erected an altar in Shechem, and called it "El-Elohe-Israel," which means "God, the God of Israel" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had not reached Bethel nor Hebron yet; he was only in Shechem, and he dwelt there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He not only dwelt there, but he bought a piece of land there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that Jacob was not strong enough and had not learned the lesson properly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had not reached the state of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's dealing with Jacob was gradual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The discipline of God and the constitution of the Holy Spirit were carried out step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it was a failure for Jacob to remain in Shechem, he nevertheless built an altar there, called on the name of God, and proclaimed God to be the God of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was a progression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God was now not only the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac, but "El-Elohe-Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"El" is God, and "Elohe" is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The meaning of the whole word is "The God of Israel is indeed God," or "God is indeed the God of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could now say such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had indeed made some progress before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter thirty-four, Jacob's daughter was defiled in that land, and two of his sons plotted and killed Shechem and all the males of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This put Jacob in a very difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was then that God called him to Bethel 35:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God disciplined him and guided him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wanted to live in Shechem, but God would not let him live there for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have mentioned before that Abraham lived in three places in Canaan: Shechem, Bethel, and Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He built altars in all three places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These three places carry the characteristics of Canaan; they are in fact a representation of the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After Peniel, God intended to take Jacob on the path of Abraham, first to Shechem, then to Bethel, and finally to Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Abraham passed through these three places, and God led Jacob through these three places as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Peniel, God led him on to Shechem and then to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peniel and Bethel match one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At Peniel God said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel" 32:28 , and at Bethel He also said, "Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob" 35:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, Peniel was the beginning, while Bethel was the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Going to Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genesis 35:1 says, "And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God told him to go up to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Bethel was a place that particularly touched Jacob's heart because he dreamed and God appeared to him there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have mentioned earlier that Bethel means the house of God; it signifies the authority of Christ, that Christ is ruling over His house.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It also signifies the corporate life, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this house there should not be any defilement, sin, or anything that is contrary to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why Jacob told his household and those who were with him to "put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments" when they went up to Bethel v. 2 . In other words, they had to leave behind everything that was related to the idols before they could go up to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Shechem Jacob buried the strange gods and all their earrings under the oak v. 4 . The meaning of Shechem is "strength of the shoulder." In other words, Christ deals with our idols and our sins, and Christ deals with all the things which we cannot deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The oak of Shechem speaks of the riches of Isaac; it shows us that everything contrary to us is dealt with there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Shechem Christ has enough power to deal with all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His shoulder is broad enough to bear all these responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Bethel is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There should only be clean conduct and clean living in the house of God, and all the unclean things should be dealt with before one can go up to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God demands not only that we have a clean living individually, but that we also have a clean living corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Bethel cannot tolerate any unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Body of Christ is Christ, and only Christ can remain in His Body; everything else must be left behind in Shechem.</S>
