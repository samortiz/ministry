   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit in 1 Corinthians 12:13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit can be seen in 1 Corinthians 12:13, which says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be baptized in one Spirit is one aspect, and to drink one Spirit is the other aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both aspects are illustrated by water, but one aspect is to go into the water, while the other aspect is that the water comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be baptized in water is to get into the water, while to drink water is to take the water into us; these are two different actions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may have the inward aspect of the Spirit regeneration, indwelling, and infilling but we may not have the outward aspect of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament, however, some people had the outward aspect without the inward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have the drink within but not the clothing without, or we may have the clothing without but not the drink within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are two different aspects, and neither can substitute for the other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>TWO KINDS OF FILLING WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are two kinds of filling with the Holy Spirit, the inward filling and the outward filling, which are illustrated by water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be filled with water as our drink is an inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be put into water to be baptized by immersion is an outward filling; to be buried, immersed, in water, is to be filled outwardly with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to discern the two aspects of the work of the Spirit, we must point out a problem with translation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the New Testament there are two different Greek words used for the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In English, however, they are translated into the same word; this causes people to be unclear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament there is always a distinction between these two fillings, and they are never confused.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 2:2 says, "And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Filled here is the inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word in Greek is pleroo, meaning "to fill inwardly."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse, the wind filled the house inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 4 says, "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word filled here is another word in Greek, pletho, meaning "to fill outwardly."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The wind filled the house inwardly, while the Holy Spirit filled the disciples outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may compare this to water in a baptistery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The baptistery is filled with water inwardly, but when someone is baptized in the baptistery, he is filled with the water not inwardly but outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pleroo is used in Acts 13:52, which says, "And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is also used in Ephesians 5:18, which says, "Be filled in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word pletho is used in Luke 1:15, 41, and 67, referring to John the Baptist, his mother, and his father, who were filled with the Spirit outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This same word is used also in Acts 4:8 and 31, when the Spirit came upon Peter and the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 9:17 and 13:9 the Spirit also came upon Paul outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pletho in all these passages refers to the outpouring of the Spirit for the outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE OUTWARD FILLING FOR MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luke 1:15 says, "For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall by no means drink wine and liquor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This filling is the outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For John the Baptist to be filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly means that the Holy Spirit would come down upon him to equip and empower him for his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 41 says, "And when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Mary, the mother of the Lord, came to the mother of John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit came upon Elizabeth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She was filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, so she prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 67 says, "And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Holy Spirit came down also upon the father of John the Baptist, so he also prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was not the inward filling; it was the outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we have seen, Acts 2:4 says that on the day of Pentecost, the disciples were in the house, which was filled with the Holy Spirit as the rushing wind, and they were all filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is, they were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be baptized is to get into something, not to take something into us; this is the outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Acts 4:8 says, "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This filling was for power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time, Peter was empowered, equipped, with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He had received the outward filling on the day of Pentecost, but at this time the Holy Spirit came down upon him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 31, Peter with the disciples was filled for a third time: "And when they had so besought, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit for power, not for life; this filling was something coming down upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Acts 9:17 says, "And Ananias went away and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him, he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me Jesus, who appeared to you on the road on which you were coming so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A little disciple laid his hands on Saul, who later became the apostle Paul, that Saul might be filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 13:9 says, "But Saul, who is also Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On all the above occasions, this kind of filling was the outward filling for ministry.</S>
