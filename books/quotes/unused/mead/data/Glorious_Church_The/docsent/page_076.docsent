   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Old Testament the tabernacle was arranged so that it was in the center of the Israelites' camp.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Three tribes dwelt on the east, three on the west, three on the south, and three on the north.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is recorded in the book of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The position of the New Jerusalem is similar to that of the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wall of this city has three gates in each direction: on the east, west, south, and north a total of twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the twelve tribes dwelt around the tabernacle, the nations will dwell around the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fact that the nations will "walk" by the light of the city means that the nations on earth will come to the New Jerusalem, and their walk to the New Jerusalem will be guided by the light of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The "glory" which the kings shall bring refers to that glory which belongs to the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They will give the city the glory of their domain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Glory" here has the same meaning as "glory" in Genesis 31:1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It means the best produce of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, in the new earth the kings of the earth will bring the best produce of their localities and present it as a gift to the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 21:25 says, "And its gates shall by no means be shut by day, for there will be no night there."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that the gates will not be shut by day reveals that in the new heaven and new earth there will still be the difference between day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The nations can come to the city in their day time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But "there will be no night there" in the city there will be no night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since all those who dwell in the city will have resurrected bodies, they will never feel tired; they can serve God constantly day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 26 says, "And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This refers to the kings of verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The kings of the earth will not only bring their glory to the city, but they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 27 says, "And anything common and he who makes an abomination and a lie shall by no means enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything that is of man and everything that belongs to the flesh are common.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only what is of Christ and the Holy Spirit can enter; anything else cannot get in. "He who makes an abomination" in the Scriptures especially refers to idolatry, and he who makes "a lie" refers to a relationship with Satan, because lies are from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are related to idols or to sin cannot enter into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life can enter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the new heaven and new earth there will only be two kinds of inhabitants: First, there are those who have been saved by the blood they will dwell in the city and have their names written in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then there are those who will be transferred from the millennium they will continue to live and become the inhabitants of the new earth.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They can only go in and come out of the city.</S>
