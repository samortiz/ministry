   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Migration</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the brothers and sisters are trained, they can be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostles are the ones who should remain in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In reading the Bible, many people think that the twelve disciples were supposed to go to the ends of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If that were to be the case, how could the twelve disciples travel through the whole earth?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible shows us that the twelve apostles were to remain in Jerusalem, and that Samaria should be taken by Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter's visit to Samaria was a temporary one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would have been wrong for him to settle down in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The gospel work is a relay race; it is not done by one man alone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, the co-workers should remain in their own Jerusalems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After they gain some people, they should send them out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If they do not send out people, persecutions will come, and difficulties will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order for the gospel to go out, there is the need for migration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostles should remain in Jerusalem and work there, and all the brothers and sisters should receive training from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, the church should care for the poor people, the unbelievers, and the new believers; it should learn how to deal with them, how to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After they are perfected, they should be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of coordination will be effective; it will spread to all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only do the apostles have to preach the gospel; all the brothers and sisters have to preach the gospel as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Philip was not specially ordained to be an evangelist, in the same way that Stephen was not specially ordained to be a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We think that only special brothers can do special works.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet, Philip was simply one of those who were serving the tables.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to know that Samaria was taken over by such a table-server.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Coordination requires that everyone be consecrated and that everyone offer up what he has.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps many will say, "I do not have the eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not know how to preach the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to start learning today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you preach well, you have to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not preach well, you still have to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps the first time you preach, the sinners will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the second time you preach, they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>F. The Working Saints Offering Up</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their Material Riches</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whoever wants to be a Sunday-goer or a spectator can continue to be a pew-member.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in the church, everyone has to offer himself up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs, I have to say that from now on you are no longer working for money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a person does not offer up his riches, his consecration is invisible and intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can tell when he has taken back such a kind of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible says that the disciples laid everything at the feet of the apostles Acts 4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>ALL MYSTICAL THINGS BECOMING TANGIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AND PRACTICABLE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, every mystical thing has to become practicable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, Christ says that we have to humble ourselves and to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is this good?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Lord's word does not stop here; He charges us to wash each other's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, no one would admit that he is proud.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one would put up a sign and say that he is humble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet whether or not you are humble depends on whether or not you have washed each other's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the mystical things have to become tangible before they can become reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The book of James says that if there are poor brothers among us, and we love them, we cannot merely lift our hands and say, "May the Lord bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Be warmed and filled" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>James 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The mystical love is eternal; yet it is useless as far as practical matters are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is more practical to give the poor brother a bowl of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a brother offends me, I have to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if this forgiveness remains a mystical one, I can forgive him fifty or a hundred times, and others will still not realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This kind of forgiveness must be transformed into a kind of tangible dealing.</S>
