   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TEMPLE AND THE CITY BEING EQUALLY CRUCIAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our work is to let people know what it means to have the mingling of God and man and what it means to be under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the mingling and without God s authority, there can be no building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the temple, there is no dwelling place; without the city, there is no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, if we know God s presence without knowing His authority, we do not have the city and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s presence will eventually be lost because there is no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must have God s presence as well as His authority in order to have protection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The building always involves warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 2 speaks of building, and chapter 6 speaks of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Warfare is related to the city, not the temple; warfare is for God s authority, not His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Nehemiah returned to build the city, he encountered warfare Neh 4:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems as if the enemy did not desire to frustrate the building of the temple as much as he desired to frustrate the building of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because the city involves God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The enemy is clear that if there is no city, the temple can easily be destroyed; hence, he damages the matter of authority and order.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is no city, the temple has no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan knows that God s presence can be easily destroyed when there is no order, no authority, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every worker of the Lord needs to understand the meaning of building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To build the church is to build up God s authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a local church has only zeal, warmth, and mutual love but no order or authority, that church is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That church has no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although such a church may be very good today, the lack of protection may cause it to collapse tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Loving one another does not necessarily mean God s presence; it may be something of the natural human emotions and not have the mingling of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if we have the mingling of God, if we do not possess His authority, there is no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Authority must be established in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A church is very weak if the brothers speak differently when a situation arises.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of there being building in that church, there is a pile of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A strong church is full of God s presence and God s authority, having the temple as well as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is difficult to find God s authority in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most groups are full of human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They dignify themselves by saying that they are being democratic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, they are full of human opinions and lack God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was the condition of the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason deacons argue with elders, and elders argue with pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our intention is not to criticize others but to unveil the fact that if we disregard God s authority and emphasize man s opinion, the result is endless quarrelling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church of God is a temple and a city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church of God there are the temple and the city God s presence and His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must consider the type of work we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are we building the church or Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must first know whether we are under God s authority and are keeping our position in the order arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Few people realize that to build the church is to build God s presence and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this time onward, however, we must see that to build up the Body of Christ is to build up the mingling of God and man and to build up God s authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ALLOWING GOD TO BE BUILT INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our being built into God means that we allow God to work in us and to mingle Himself with us in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are built by God and are subjected under His authority, we can then help others by doing a work of building in them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we work on others, we first add God into them so that they have God s presence in their practical walk and living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way they become God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must then do another work in them so that they know God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is to build up the wall in them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way they will have God s presence and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are built-up persons no matter where they go.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They know what it is to have God s presence, God s mingling; they also know God s authority and God s order.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They have been built.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some brothers and sisters may be zealous, but they do not have God s temple or God s city.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may have a certain amount of God s presence, but they do not understand God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is a measure of the recovery of Ezra but nothing of the recovery of Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, others have both the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have God s presence and God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In everything they have God s mingling, and they are under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They keep the order and are under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are also reigning, because they have God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In other words, they have God s city.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we have God s city within us, we have protection for our spiritual condition.</S>
