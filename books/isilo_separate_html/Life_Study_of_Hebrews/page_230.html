In the church life we should live according to the law of life and move according to the anointing, but we have gradually come to live according to regulations and move according to organization. In the beginning, the church life was not like this. It was living, and we lived according to the inner law of life and moved according to the anointing. Gradually, however, our living according to the law of life developed into a habit, and the habit became a regulation. Thus, today we live according to regulations and move according to organization. Because we have become organized, we neglect the anointing. How I long to see the dear ones coming to clean the meeting hall according to the anointing, not according to any arrangement or organization. If in the service groups we care for who is first, second, and last, we shall have an organization. In an organization there is no need to pray, to contact the Lord, and to move according to the anointing, because everything is arranged, and we are told what to do and when to do it. A brother who is not a leading one may say, &ldquo;I am neither the first nor the last. Whatever I do will be all right. I don&rsquo;t need to look to the Lord about what time to clean, because the time has already been announced. If I am a few minutes late, it will not make any difference.&rdquo; When this brother arrives, he will stand around waiting to be told what to do. If the leading one does not come, he will not know how to function. This is not the service we see in the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIVING REVEALED<br />IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>According to the New Testament, the law of life is written into our being. In fact, even the writer Himself is in us. By coming into us, He brings both His nature and His Person into us. The nature works and the Person moves. Hence, we must live according to His nature and move according to His Person. We must clean the meeting hall according to His moving. Do not care about your rank in the church service. Only care for the living Person within you. This is the living found in the New Testament. Compared with the Old Testament, the New Testament is quite short. The Old Testament may have over a thousand pages, but the New Testament has less than three hundred pages. Christianity has become a religion of teachings and miracles. I hope that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we shall realize that we do not need the teachings and miracles found in religion. We simply need to live according to Christ&rsquo;s wonderful nature and move according to His wonderful Person. Do not depend upon regulations, arrangements, or organization. Move and act according to the living Person within you. If we do this, we shall enjoy God and become His people, and God will become so living, rich, and enjoyable to us. He will be our God, not according to regulations, but according to the inner law of life and the anointing. This is the working of the divine and human nature of the wonderful One.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE RESCUED<br />FROM RELIGION</h2><p>You may wonder why I am against religion. It is because I have passed through so many things, especially the teachings and speaking in tongues. In the past, I taught many people how to speak in tongues. But after a period of time, I saw that speaking in tongues only stirred people temporarily and that the result was not much of life. I was also in fundamental Christianity where I learned the teachings of the Bible. More than forty-five years ago, I became familiar with all the types, teachings, and prophecies. These teachings made me dormant for seven and a half years. Due to this, I have the sure standing to declare that we do not need the teachings in letters. After a certain time, I became involved with the Pentecostal movement. Now I have been commissioned and burdened by the Lord to minister Christ as life to His people. Only when you have been wholly rescued from the other things will my burden be discharged. The Spirit knows how much you need to be delivered. Not only those in Christianity but even the church people need to know the sonship. We must see that life is the only way the sonship can be brought to completion within us. The working of the law of life within us is for the carrying out of the sonship.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_229.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_231.html">Next</a> </body></html>
