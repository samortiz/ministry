	 <h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF RECEIVING GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>A saved person has received the Lord Jesus. The key to receiving the Lord Jesus is to come, eat, drink, and enjoy Him. Many can testify that it is simple to come to the Lord to eat and to drink Him. There is no need to find a secluded place in order to receive the Lord. As soon as a person hears the truth of the gospel, he simply needs to receive the Lord.</p>
<p>When I was saved, I was less than twenty years old. When I heard the gospel, I was extremely moved and felt as if every sentence was being spoken directly to me. At that time no one had to tell me how to pray. I was truly touched by the Lord, and as soon as the meeting ended, I left the meeting place and spoke to the Lord on my way home, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, from today onward I do not want anything else but You.&rdquo; When I arrived home, I knelt before the Lord and said, &ldquo;O Lord, I am a great sinner. Although I am young, I am full of sins.&rdquo; I confessed one sin after another to Him; I could not help but confess my sins. I believe that I was saved as soon as I prayed to Him on my way home. Through confessing my sins, however, I received the joy that comes in response to the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>After listening to the gospel, a man who was a judge came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you said that the unique God, who created all things, died on the cross for my sins and resurrected from the dead to be my Savior and life. But how does He enter into me?&rdquo; My words were like a foreign language to him. Although it seemed as if it was hard to believe, I told him to go home and kneel before the Lord Jesus and pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, if You are real, show me my sins so that I can confess them and receive You as my Savior.&rdquo; Since he felt that he would not suffer any loss by praying in this way, he agreed to try.</p>
<p>When he returned home, he shut the door to his room and half-jokingly knelt and prayed to the Lord Jesus. In his prayer, he said, &ldquo;Lord, if You are the real God, show me my sins.&rdquo; He soon was overcome with a sense of his sins, and he asked the Lord for forgiveness. After he prayed and confessed, he thought that Jesus would appear to him, but nothing happened. Eventually, he went to bed. The next morning as he was going to court, a sense of great joy rose up within him. At that moment, he felt as if heaven and earth had changed&mdash;the sky was beautiful, the earth was lovely, and even a barking dog along the roadside was cute. As he was judging cases in court, the people whom he previously thought were quite unworthy became lovely to him. As he judged his cases, he was joyful and his face was brimming with smiles. He was still smiling after he returned home. When his wife asked him what had happened, he could only testify that something marvelous had happened.</p>
<p>Soon afterward he came to see me and told me this story. He asked me what had happened, why he was joyful, and why he felt that heaven and earth had changed. Furthermore, he wanted to know why his view on human life had changed, why he no longer desired to continue his bad habits, and why his attitude toward others was so different. I told him that the Lord Jesus had entered into him and was working in him. Immediately, he realized that he was full of joy because Jesus had entered into him. When the Lord enters into a person, sometimes a person weeps before Him, and sometimes a person is filled with an inner peace. God&rsquo;s salvation can be expressed in many different ways, but it always gives a person a more accurate view of human life and of the things in human life. It also causes a person to realize that he has been accepted by God, based on the redemption of the Lord Jesus. This condition is expressed in some people through joy, and others realize it through an inward sense of sweetness. None of these conditions are the result of man&rsquo;s efforts or moral cultivation; rather, they are the spontaneous issue of receiving God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Thousands of Christians can testify that it is marvelous to believe in the Lord Jesus. This is the reason that some Christians seem &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; when they begin to speak of the Lord Jesus. They never tire of speaking about Him. If I preached about the Lord every day for a year, the content of my preaching would be new every day because there is so much about the Lord that is glorious and sweet. To receive our wonderful Lord, a person only needs to be simple. He only needs to come to the Lord&rsquo;s feast, putting his knowledge and doubts aside.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;All things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.&rdquo; We only need to come to eat, to drink, and to receive; the simpler we are the better. Jesus is God who came to be a man. He shed His precious blood on the cross to redeem us from our sins, and He resurrected from the dead to enter into us as life. Now He is the Spirit. We only need to receive Him with our spirit and in truthfulness. When we follow His inner sense to pray and confess our sins, the Lord Jesus will come into us. When we receive Him, we will receive God&rsquo;s salvation. Then we will have an accurate view of our human life and experience God&rsquo;s wonderful life in us.</p>
