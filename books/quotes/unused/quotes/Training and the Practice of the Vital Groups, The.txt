He has His heart's desire and His own purpose, so in eternity past He made an economy to do something for Himself
His move is first through the Adamic race second through the Abrahamic race third through the church and fourth through the overcomers
All of the following messages will be concerning this last step, the step of God's move through the overcomers
From the very first page of the Bible, God revealed Himself as theTriune God, and He needs a Body as a corporate expression to manifest Him
God judged the fallen race firstly by water, by the flood, at Noah's time , and then by fire from heaven to burn Sodom and Gomorrah
God wanted a people to be one with Him to carry out His economy that Christ might be brought into humanity through incarnation
For Him to come into humanity, He needed a people, and for these people to live, there was also the need of the land
He swerved out of the enjoyment of the good land and was punished by God with death to himself and his two sons
During that time the first generation of those who came out of Egypt died, and they were strewn along in the wilderness
They did not utterly destroy the Canaanites, and the remaining Canaanites eventually became a big problem to them
God also judged them by allowing them to be captured and subdued by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans
The New Testament does not show us so many details concerning the enjoyment of Christ as the Old Testament does in type
God's intention is to bring forth the church as the Body of Christ for the corporate expression of the processed Triune God
The fine flour of the meal offering signifies Christ as food for both God and man, but Christianity has mixed leaven with the fine flour
In God's move through the Adamic race, through the Abrahamic race, and then through the church there was a failure
In the book of Revelation there is the unique call of the Head, Christ, to His believers for them to be His overcomers
At the close of each of the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Head, Christ, sounded out His call for the overcomers
The book of Revelation is not a book merely to tell us about the beasts or about the three and a half years of the great tribulation
God moves through the overcomers to accomplish His economy with the pneumatic Christ as the center and the goal
The term the pneumatic Christ means that in the last step of God's move, Christ was made the all-inclusive Spirit
He is all-inclusive; He is rich; He is bountiful in His supply; and this is the very Christ in this age of the overcomers
The first crucial point of the major items of the Lord's recovery is the participation in the processed Triune God
The second crucial point of the major items of the Lord's recovery is the rich enjoyment of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ
Today Christians know the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, but very few know that the Spirit of God today is the consummated compound Spirit
We have to learn to do something higher than ethical conduct, such as not losing our temper by the exercise of our patience
We may behave ourselves when we are in the meeting, but this may be merely according to our carefulness and not by the divine life
Many of the elders are selfish for their own church, but they may not be burdened for the building up of the Body of Christ
The Bible, the New Testament, shows us clearly that every city should have only one church, just like a husband should have only one wife
In the recent turmoil, the divisive ones did not care for the seriousness of the division which they have made
The final crucial point of the major items of the Lord's recovery is the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ
You may be very nice to a certain leading brother, but if he would speak to you in a frank way, you might be offended
To overcome is not just to overcome all the obstacles and frustrations to carry out the practices of the God-ordained way
In the book of Revelation, He calls for the overcomers to carry out His move on the earth for the accomplishment of His eternal economy
There are the living overcomers, the 144,000 raptured to the third heaven to stand with the Lord on Mount Zion
Besides these two groups of overcomers, there is another group who will overcome Antichrist, his idol, and the idolatrous number of his name
Of course, we all like to see that the church is going on well and improving, but not all the members of a family are the strong ones
Regardless of the condition of a local church, as long as it is set up on the proper ground of oneness, it is still the church
We will be enlightened by Him to see all our defects, mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, trespasses, and transgressions
The Lord will then gain some overcomers in your locality, and there will be a way for the Lord to accomplish His eternal economy
Those who do not overcome in this age will lose Christ in the age of righteousness, the age of the kingdom, the age of discipline
If we are defeated in this age, at the coming back of the Lord, He will cut us asunder, cut us off, from the enjoyment of Christ
To cut them off does not mean that they will perish but that they will be cut asunder from the enjoyment of Christ even today
Mercy is not as deep or as tender as compassions, so the word compassions picked up by the apostle is quite significant
In this life we have been saved, we are being saved, and we are to be saved to the extent that we can even reign as kings in this life
The degraded church has also married herself to the world, and the world is the satanic system of the evil one
Such teachings annul the functions of the members of Christ and do not allow Christ to function as the Head of the Body
They are neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, and because of this the Lord says that He is about to spew them out of His mouth
The Brethren are Christless because the Lord is pictured as being outside the lukewarm church, knocking on the door
The first cause of desiring to be vitalized is the compassions of God, and the second is the degradation of the church
If we do not have the boldness to say that we are the overcomers, we should say, 'I'm going to be an overcomer'!
The purpose of being vitalized is also for the building up of the Body of Christ through the proper practice of the local churches
The practice of the local churches is on the local ground in the oneness of the unique Body of Christ by four steps
We have to believe that a good number of the thousands of people living around us are ones whom God has chosen in eternity past
A fisherman will fish patiently until he catches some fish, and we need to be the same in our labor in the gospel
We need to labor consistently and look to the Lord that each of us could gain one person yearly as remaining fruit for the church life
We need to prophesy to build up the local churches for the consummation of the building up of the Body of Christ
In our repenting prayers, we need to make a thorough confession of all our failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, transgressions, trespasses, etc
After you get your companions in fellowship, you must learn to take the lead to reconsecrate yourself to the Lord
In order to be vitalized, we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind so that we will not be fashioned according to this age
Our body needs to be presented to the Lord, our mind needs to be renewed, taken over by the Lord, and our spirit needs to be burning
The church life is today's Jerusalem; within the church life there must be a group of overcomers, and these overcomers are today's Zion
Zion is the high peak, the center, the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, and the reality of the church, the holy city
A local church must have some overcomers, and these overcomers are the peak and the center of that local church
They are to consummate, to finish, the building up of the local church and to bring in the consummated New Jerusalem in eternity
These three enemies are mainly toward the good Christians, toward the brothers and sisters who are regularly attending the meetings
If we have not borne fruit for three years, for five years, or even for ten years, our enjoyment of Christ should be questioned
They may say that they do not feel anything is wrong with them, but actually something is wrong that is preventing them from having children
Our spirit and our soul are within our body, so if our body is presented to the Lord, our entire being is presented to Him
We need to deal with ourselves and we need to deal with our relationship with and concept concerning the practical world which is todays age
We may be enjoying Christ to a certain extent, but we need to enjoy Him in a deeper, higher, broader, and richer way
Matthew 252430 tells clearly how the lazy evil servant will be disciplined by the Lord in the coming age by being cast into outer darkness
We may know this portion of the Word, and yet not really have much regard for the discipline in the coming age
Also, Matthew 25 tells us that if we do not make a profit with the Lord's talent, we will be disciplined in the coming age
When Brother Watchman Nee was a student, he decided to fast and pray every Saturday for the next day's preaching of the gospel
We must take a way of doing things in every step by having the full assurance that the Lord is satisfied and that we also are satisfied
We should not excuse ourselves by saying that the nations are too evil and that the current and tide of today's world are too strong
You need to pray over the name list and seek the Lord's leading concerning who should be the first for you to take care of
You should keep yourself open to the Lord for His new leading to visit new people other than your acquaintances
Nearly every Lord's Day, this brother's home was prepared to receive people for lunch after the morning meeting
Whatever way you take, you should do it persistently with patience and endurance and do not expect to have a quick reaping
We need to practice the items of the God-ordained way so that we can do them in a consistent way with longevity
We pointed out that we need to go to the Lord individually to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers
The ones who get saved should have the sensation and realization that they are sinful and need the Lord's forgiveness
The Lord Jesus told us that anyone who would come after Him must deny himself and take up his cross to lose his soul-life
If you do not have such a repentance and confession with tears, how can your companion be led into being vitalized?
Because we are living in a dirty world, medical doctors tell us that we should wash our hands frequently to avoid getting sick
We need to see that the old man came out of the evil Satan who is everlasting, so he needs a kind of everlasting fire
If we pray, after five minutes we realize that something has been rekindled within us, and that is the new man
When we come to pray, to take the spiritual food, we have to wash our hands, and to wash our hands is to repent
While he was praying and confessing, he received a revelation of the seventy weeks, but Daniel 9 is mostly occupied with his confession
They have never seen, especially in the New Testament, that there will be a time of discipline for the loose Christians
The New Testament says that the unfaithful, loose Christians, at the Lord's coming back, will be cast into outer darkness
We need to be vitalized so that we can be brought on to maturity to receive the Lord's reward in the next age instead of His discipline
We want to be vitalized overcomers in the church life who are one with the Lord to conquer deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness
Whenever we go out to visit people, whether they are Christians or unbelievers, we should bring all of these tracts
We need to come out of the deadness of Sardis , the lukewarmness of Laodicea , and the barrenness of the degenerating believers
When sinners repent, believe, and are regenerated, they become like newborn babes who need to be nourished by us
Humanly speaking, an education takes six years for elementary school, six years for junior high and high school, and four years for college
Spiritually speaking, we also need to be educated in the divine truths for the Christian life and the church life
The length of time it takes to 'graduate' differs with people according to their desire for the Lord, their endeavoring, and their capacity
In a family it is good to hear all the members of different ages speak, from the young children to the grandparents
We have seen that God's ordained way has four stages: the stages of begetting, feeding, teaching, and building
A normal Christian lives the normal church life and preaches the gospel in a normal way to save people into the church, into the Body
He should make a thorough confession before God of his mistakes wrongdoings shortcomings defects transgressions trespasses sins and evils
Through this kind of repentance and confession he will begin to have a close intimate fellowship with the Lord and with his fellow believers
He can also be perfected concerning how to pray, how to read the Word of God, how to call on the Lord's name, and how to exercise his spirit
Paul dispensed all the riches which he had received of the Lord to the needy ones in order to fulfill his stewardship
We can expound the word of God in a proper way, in a straight way, by having ourselves exercised to do everything accurately
Because of the fall, our humanity is unregulated, so there is still the need of some outward training, which we call character training
We should be genuine exact and strict not only in the church meetings and church service but also in our daily life and in our private life
If a young brother is speaking to a man who is about sixty, the way he sits and talks to this man should be in a very respectful manner
Our being generated made us an old creation, but in regeneration God has made us a new creation, so we must be new persons
We also need to contact people before and after the church meetings, especially the Lord's Day morning meeting
How about we come to the meeting tomorrow half an hour earlier to have some fellowship for about twenty minutes'?
He will be impressed with the loving atmosphere, the intimate atmosphere, among the saints in the meeting hall
When we contact the saints and the new ones in this way, it helps us to function in the meeting; it makes it easier for us to prophesy
We must have such an atmosphere in the church meeting, an atmosphere in which people know that we really love one another
In human society where is a pure flock of people who love one another in an incorruptible way with much encouragement building up and help
In the Acts and the Epistles, we can see that the early apostles also carried out the same kind of blending among the saints
We are to bring them to the tents where the shepherds are and where the people of God meet with the Chief Shepherd
By the end of chapter twenty the Gospel of John is actually concluded yet there is still one more chapter as an appendix chapter twentyone
He was taking the lead among the disciples throughout the three and a half years of the Lord's earthly ministry
Hebrews 13:20 says that Christ is the great Shepherd, and the Lord Himself told us in John 10:11 that He is the good Shepherd
He told us that Christ was the Chief Shepherd and that he was one of the many shepherds under the Chief Shepherd
Some may think that the Lord Jesus went to the seashore in John 21 to help the disciples get some fish for eating
Later, Peter said that he was one of the shepherds, and he exhorted his fellow elders to shepherd the flock of God
The biggest lack, the biggest shortage, is in the eldership, because the elders should be the shepherds among God's people
Even if there are some shepherds, they concentrate mostly on outward affairs; they do not shepherd people's souls
The Lord's recovery in the United States has come to a point where we cannot go on further without the shepherding
Late one night, close to midnight, he was about to go to bed when he remembered that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day
His speaking to Peter indicated to him that he should forget about his failure and take care of the Lord's lambs and sheep
My burden is to stir you up that you may realize that today the Lord's recovery needs you to rise up to contact people
It is no wonder that the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:58 that our labor for Christ will never be in vain
According to the New Testament teaching, the first burden, the first responsibility, of the believers is to get people
In the bank, in the supermarket, on the street, and everywhere we need to practice contacting people until it becomes our habit
You may find out that it would be appropriate to read a few paragraphs from the booklet The Mystery of Human Life with him
You should get yourself acquainted with the contents of these gospel tracts so that you can impart them into the new ones
That is the time for you to sit down to talk to him slowly and gradually for fifteen minutes or maybe half an hour
We may make mistakes as we contact others, but we need to realize that sometimes even our mistakes fulfill the Lord's purpose
When you contact people, you should always discern whether or not you should make this person a constant contact
After a number of contacts you may realize that the time is ripe for you to invite someone to your house or for you to be invited by him
Even though we have released a number of messages concerning the practice of the vital groups, my burden has not yet been discharged
We may feel okay about what we have shared and what we have heard, but the speaking Spirit says, 'No, the burden is still not discharged'
You should have a burden because you see that you are old, dead, lukewarm, fruitless, pitiful, and numb, with no feeling
The Lord will shine on you and show you that you are like a person buried under the earth with layer upon layer of dirt
If you do not go to the Lord and have a thorough repentance and confession in His presence, you are deceiving yourselves
After a number of months, an intimate friend of mine who was a very dear brother in the Lord came from Shanghai
It is recorded that when Jacob led his wives and children and the livestock to meet his brother, he knew that he could not journey too fast
If the vital groups had never been started at all not even in an ABC way we could not have had such good meetings with such promising signs
When a student learns addition and subtraction, he has started to learn mathematics, but he needs to go on in his learning
We need to accept what we have and where we are at the present time and aspire to go on with the Lord step by step
When what we do is not according to what we expect, we begin to doubt about whether we have something real or genuine
We analyze and then we check with others concerning the genuineness of what we are practicing and what we have experienced
We have to be careful about this because we may be going back to lay a foundation of repentance after we have already laid this foundation
He has the key, the power, to open the door that no one can shut, and He has the power to shut the door that no one can open
Have more and more mercy upon us that we could go on, that we could grow, that we could improve, and that we could mature'
You do not necessarily need to wait until you are finished contacting all your relatives, friends, classmates, and colleagues
It may be that he will be begotten by you next week or even next year, so you have to keep him as your constant contact
We need to exercise our endurance and still spend time to raise up those whom the Lord has given us to care for
The blind man who contacted the Lord outside of the city of Jericho cried out, 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me'!
We should have the assurance that the Lord has done something with us because we have been pursuing Him and seeking Him
The only way for us is to contact people, and the only secret of our success is to have constant contacts for our whole life
Faith means not doing anything in yourself, not doing anything by yourself, and not doing anything according to your feeling
We should learn that when we wake up and rise up to labor in the Lord Satan will try to frustrate us so we should not trust in our feelings
Some think that if anything is of the Lord the Lord will let us know and tell us clearly in advance what we should do and where we should go
We have been instructed and advised to repent, to confess, and to have intimate fellowship with the Lord and with our companions
Since you have repented, you have confessed, you have fellowshipped and still remain in the fellowship, you are qualified to go
If you are still hesitating, still lingering, still considering, still feeling that you are not qualified, you are wrong
The elders should take some action to supervise, but they may not like to oversee others to find out the real situation
Whenever you contact people, always grasp the opportunity to say something concerning Christ, to sow a seed of Christ into them
They may even respond at the end of their life, showing that the seed of Christ sown into people is never in vain
Our living on this earth is for the Lord, so that we can contact people and so that He can gain people through us
Someone to whom you give a tract may leave it on his coffee table, and the other members of his family may read it
The only distinction between Him and us is this: He needs us to branch Him out, and we need Him to be our supply and to be our everything
There is a person today in this universe, even on this earth, who is called the Spirit, and we are one spirit with Him
The normal Christians, the vital group people, should be those who live, act, walk, and have their being according to the spirit
A person who does things only according to the mingled spirit is a normal Christian, and he surely is a member of the vital groups
If from the first day of the year to the last day of the year you never speak to anybody concerning Christ, you do not flow Him
Regardless of how much you feel you are enjoying Christ, participating in His riches, the flow of life within you has been stopped
The Lord said in John 7:38, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
When we are filled with the Spirit, we are full of Christ, and our uttering organ will be open to speak forth Christ
Now we have seen the status of the vital group, the commission of the vital group, and the function of the vital group
Do not forget that to be a believer in Christ is to be a part of Christ, a member of Christ, a branch of Christ
You should abide in Him to flow Him out, to branch Him out, to bear fruit by flowing the river of grace, by speaking
Just realize that you are a branch of Christ, abiding in Him, walking, living, and having your being according to the spirit
We all should say, 'I am just a branch abiding in Christ and walking according to the spirit to flow Christ as rivers of living water'
The apostle remembered the Thessalonians first in their work of faith, then in their labor of love, and finally in their endurance of hope
In verse 29 he said that he labored for this, struggling according to God's operation, which operated in him in power
After one week we may see very little growth, and after two more weeks the growth may appear to be about the same
To practice the vital groups, we must be vital to the extent that we are willing to labor in any way and at any cost
Through that conference he was caught by the Lord, and later his brother, who was a traveling preacher, also took the way of the recovery
Eventually, the Lord gave them a large piece of land, and now they have a training center with a full-time training on that land
In the 1993 Thanksgiving Conference in Anaheim, the attendance in the last meeting was 3,260 adults plus more than 800 children
We may be concerned because, after practicing the new way for some time, it seems that thus far we have seen little fruit
One principle is certain: if no one goes to contact a person, the seeking Spirit has no 'line' on which to 'hook' that person
You may make an excuse, saying that you have been working in a particular place for three years and have not gained one person
Eventually, if we speak to people concerning Jesus, they may not believe, but they will hear a word concerning Jesus
Whether we think they will understand it or not, we need to believe that whatever speaks about Christ will work
If we give someone a tract, he may throw it on the street, but what one person throws away another may pick up and bring home
In His ascension the Lord Jesus transcended and surpassed Hades, the earth, the air, and also the third heaven
Because Satan still has a place in the third heaven, even the third heaven needs to be under the feet of Christ
On the day of Pentecost, when Peter stood up to speak, he did not stand up by himself; he stood up with the eleven
Year round, from spring to winter, the same tree stands there apparently the same, but every year that tree bears fruit
According to Luke 16:9, in the kingdom age many will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles because of our labor
Until today we have enjoyed Your rich presence all the time that has made up for our weakness and our shortcomings
Day after day, week after week, month after month, and even year after year, Your mercy has been our strengthening and our trust
Lord, we still ask for Your mercy, for Your blessing, for Your presence, for Your anointing, for Your Spirit, and for Your word
If you know the book of Matthew, you can see that Matthew stresses the aspect of the kingdom of the heavens to the uttermost
Kingdom of the heavens is a term used exclusively by Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God
We need to see that the decree of the kingdom's constitution is altogether a matter of regulating God's people's life and work
God's people's living and working should be something organic according to the divine regulations fulfilling the spiritual requests
If you ask a healthy person why he is healthy, he will tell you that it is because he takes care of the principles of life
According to the God-ordained principle, the night is for us to sleep, and the day is for our living and working
Healthy eating must be moderate, neither too fast nor too slow, in order to satisfy the inner feeling of our body
We planted many small trees around the meeting hall in Anaheim seventeen years ago, but today they are all big
Even though the trees are constricted according to God's ordination, they still need the human hands to trim them
A miracle is not mentioned in John 15 concerning the bearing of fruit, but trimming is strongly referred to by the Lord
We might think that the apostle Paul would bring thousands to the Lord, but we can see in Paul's history that this was not the case
Perhaps he will say that he gained three last week and two more this week, but after a year he will not gain one as remaining fruit
We should always contact the Lord trying our best to remain in our spirit doing everything according to the spirit and praying unceasingly
