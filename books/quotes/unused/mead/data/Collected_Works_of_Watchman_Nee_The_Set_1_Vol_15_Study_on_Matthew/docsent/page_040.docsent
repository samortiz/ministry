   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Binding the strong man is by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This was directly mentioned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The strong man dwells in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The casting out of demons requires the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The casting out of demons needs to be done in the name of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit is the power of the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How does one bind the strong man?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Indirectly, it is done through the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the cross, the Lord crushed the head of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 3:15 Satan's whole body will be dealt with in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cross dealt only with Satan's head, removing his power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He attempts to bruise the Lord's heel because the Lord is advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan tried to bite the Lord from behind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While the Lord was on earth, Satan could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after the Lord ascended, Satan tries his best today to bruise His heel by shaking the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, the Holy Spirit descended to execute what the Lord had accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With the cross as the base and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we can bind Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On our side, we can bind Satan by our prayer out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A great principle of the work is first to bind, and then to plunder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must bind the strong man by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 30:"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because what is happening today is a positive matter, there are only two sides, with no neutral ground.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why the Lord spoke this word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>" With Me" means "standing on My side"; this refers to position.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To "gather" is to gather others together; this refers to work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not one Christian on this earth should fail to stand on the Lord's side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea were believers who were not absolute for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, not one Christian should fail to gather.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not right to never bring anyone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 31:"Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every sin will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin here particularly refers to one's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even blasphemy can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 32:"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does it mean to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To speak against the Holy Spirit is to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not to cheat the Spirit or to quench the moving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, it is to speak against the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And what does it mean to speak against the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a sin committed with full awareness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not merely to say something by mistake; it is to say clearly that the Holy Spirit is the ruler of the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not to be against the Spirit in conduct; it is to be against the Spirit in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"It will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Questions and Answers on the Gospel The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Set 1, Volume 20 we mention five kinds of forgiveness: 1 eternal forgiveness, 2 forgiveness for fellowship, 3 governmental forgiveness, 4 forgiveness through another party, and 5 forgiveness in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This age, or the present age, is the age of grace; the age to come is the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sin of speaking against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The forgiveness in this age is related to the matter of eternal salvation, whereas the forgiveness in the coming age is related to the matter of position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verses 33 through 37 form the fourth subsection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 33:"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What the Lord meant here is that people can know your heart by looking at your fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 34:"Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>An error in the mouth is preceded by an error in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First the heart has a problem, then the mouth speaks it forth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 35:"The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word treasure in the original language implies the way a person keeps valuables in a bank safe-deposit box.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 36:"And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A man's being judged only according to his words would be enough to make him feel that he has no place to hide; he would wish that he could crawl into a hole in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Holy Spirit is offended and ceases to work, man does not have any hope of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, it is more difficult for the rebellious ones to repent than it is for the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reason the Sabbath is placed first in this chapter is to show a change of dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This chapter refers to David because David typifies the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It particularly cites the case of the eating of the bread of the presence to prove that David was rejected by the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It refers to the priests for the purpose of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the millennium the Israelites will still keep the Sabbath and eat the bread of the presence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When David ate the bread of the presence, God did not acknowledge it as the bread of the presence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There were twelve cakes of the bread of the presence, signifying that the Lord was for the children of Israel and the children of Israel were for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When David was fleeing, not one of the twelve tribes followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, the bread of the presence was not considered as the bread of the presence.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If they had received David, how could the occasion of eating the bread of the presence have happened?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Likewise, the question today is not a matter of whether or not one should keep the Sabbath, but a matter of whether or not one cares for the Lord.</S>
