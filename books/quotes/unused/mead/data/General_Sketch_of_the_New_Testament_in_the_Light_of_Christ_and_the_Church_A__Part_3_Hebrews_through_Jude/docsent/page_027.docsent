   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Desiring to Be First</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This Epistle also shows us that among the believers, there are often some who want to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 9 and 10 say, "I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the fellowship of the saints, we should not have the expectation to be the leader, the "ruling class."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we desire to serve the Lord, the more we must be willing to be small.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the believers, to be big is not a glory; it is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be small is a real glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should never try to be great; we must always learn to be small.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The economy among Christians is different from that of the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Among the worldly people, to be rich is glorious, but among the saints, to be poor is more glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, among the worldly people, to gain things is glorious, but among Christians, to lose things and suffer is more glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason we must be renewed in our mind Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must not seek after a high rank.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The highest rank is the most shameful thing, while the lowest rank is the most glorious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn to be small and poor, and we must love suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not try to be the head or rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To do this is to damage the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we put the three Epistles of John together, we will see a clear picture of the proper fellowship among the members of God's divine family.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First John gives us the principles of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second John tells us to have no fellowship with certain ones who claim to be Christians, while 3 John tells us to extend hospitality in fellowship to all the dear saints, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we should not try to be a leader and rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do, we will damage the fellowship of God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH IN JUDE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The short book of Jude is the last of the supplementary Epistles, dealing with the problem of apostasy in the church, the drifting away of the church from the track of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Toward the beginning of his Epistle, Jude charges us to contend for the faith v. 3 . The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith Acts 6:7; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13 , in which we believe for our common salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The faith is the New Testament inheritance substantiated to us and realized by us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This inheritance is the Triune God processed to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jude goes on to speak of the heresies of the apostates v. 4 , historical examples of the Lord's judgment upon apostasy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>5-7 , and the evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord's judgment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>8-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Toward the end of his Epistle, Jude says, "But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the foundation of this holy faith and in the sphere of it, through praying in the Holy Spirit, we build ourselves up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jude's word concerning building up ourselves in our most holy faith is equal to Peter's word about being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To pray in the Holy Spirit, to keep ourselves in the love of God, and to await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ is to live in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way the entire Blessed Trinity is employed and enjoyed by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, Jude speaks of caring for others with mercy in fear Jude 22-23 , and he praises Him who is able to guard and set the believers before His glory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>24-25 .</S>
