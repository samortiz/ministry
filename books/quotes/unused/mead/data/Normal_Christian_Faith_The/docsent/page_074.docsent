   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KILL IT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One time I was at the home of one of my friends.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He had a maid who gave him much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only was she lazy, but she had the habit of stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She possessed every vice that a maid could have.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My friend asked for my advice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His intention was for me to preach to her some in the hope that she might change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I told him an extremely simple answer: Give her up and hire another!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the same way that God deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The human life can never be improved through preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God says, "I do not need you anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With that He simply kills it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the difference between God's provision and our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We hope to suppress sin in order to tame the wild desires of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But what result have we obtained?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many unbelievers have changed their conduct at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were sinful and repulsive; now they are mild and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this is not the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The salvation of God does not depend on how many sins you have committed in the past or how much you have improved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a matter of changing from violence to gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God sees sin as something related to our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He deals with the problem at its root by removing the life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as this life continues, sin remains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the day that this life is put to death, sin ceases.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>NOT A MENTAL RECKONING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This death, furthermore, is not the death that some people talk about, where one merely considers everything in the past to be gone for good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The amazing thing is that you can consider as much as you want that your temper is gone and dead, but in actuality it always comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can only have a psychological reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In reality it is still very alive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It follows you everywhere you go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever you turn around it is there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You can never rid yourself of your temper, no matter how hard you try.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>DIE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can we die?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The answer again goes back to this one fact: God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has caused Christ to die, and when we are in Him we died also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have said that the forgiveness of sin is because we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has caused Christ to die, and since we are in Him, we died also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God judged Christ, He judged us also.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By this judgment our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot put ourselves to death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The death of Christ, in which God has included us, makes us dead with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us read again Romans 6:6: "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no alternative for our old man but to die.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no choice left for him to take.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, it is not a simple matter to die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God had to include us in Christ and then crucify Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Christ died on the cross, we were all included.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From that moment on, we were no longer ourselves; we no longer existed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We never can or will crucify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is our co-crucifixion with Him that took care of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the basic solution to the problem of sin.</S>
