<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in a short-term training for young co-workers held in Taipei, Taiwan, from April to May 1985. Chapters 11 and 12 were spoken by Andrew Yu and Liu Suey on behalf of Brother Witness Lee.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING PEOPLE TO LIVE<br />
THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>After their salvation people often ask how to live the Christian life. This question is related to our work. As those who serve full time, our work is to lead people to salvation, and after a person is saved, we need to lead him to live the Christian life. I would ask this question: according to our knowledge and experience, how should a person live the Christian life?</p>
<p>Some say that to live the Christian life is to live in spirit, to live a life according to the spirit, and to know that Christ is our life. This answer is too general; it is not specific. If we use only these items to lead the newly saved ones to live the Christian life, they will feel empty. Others say that the Christian life is a life that depends on the Lord. Although this answer is not wrong, it is vague. A new believer will not be able to touch the substance of what depending on the Lord means. Hence, we should not use theories or high and profound spiritual doctrines when we speak with new believers. Since we are speaking about practice, we must be specific.</p>
<p>Some have proposed that we use the sequence recorded in 2 Corinthians 3 through 7 to speak to new believers concerning how to live the Christian life. This way, however, is too particular. We cannot use it to lead new believers in living the Christian life. We need a practical and normal way. Of course, it would be more practical to use only some verses in 2 Corinthians instead of using an entire section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying, Reading the Bible, Meeting,<br />
and Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>When we lead new believers, we must be practical and help them build up a living of praying, reading the Bible, meeting, and preaching the gospel. Among these items, prayer must be the first. This can be likened to newborn babies, who first learn to breathe and then learn to drink milk. A Christian&rsquo;s breathing is praying. Hence, when helping the new believers, we should not help them first to read the Bible but to pray. We may say to the new believers, &ldquo;Now that you are saved, you must live the Christian life. The first item in the Christian life is prayer.&rdquo; In practice, we may speak from our own experience concerning prayer, but we should not speak too long. Later, we can tell them that the second important thing in the Christian life is reading the Bible. We can tell them how to read the Bible or suggest which book to read. If the new believers have questions, we should endeavor to answer them. When time allows, we can explain the structure of the Bible, telling them about the Old Testament and the New Testament.</p>
<p>The third important thing is to meet with other believers. We must tell new believers that the church is a corporate body and that the church is also our home. A newborn baby needs a home; it is a pitiful thing for a baby to be homeless. The church is now our home, and it can take care of us in many aspects. The fourth matter in the Christian life is to preach the gospel. In leading new believers to live the Christian life, we must help them in these four matters: praying, reading the Bible, meeting, and preaching the gospel. We would have good results if, after their baptism, the new believers could spend three or five days together, eating their meals together, having morning revival together, and being taught how to pray, read the Bible, meet, and preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Leading new believers to practice these items depends entirely on how much we know and experience these items. If we neither pray much nor know much about prayer, we will not be able to render help to others. This also applies to reading the Bible. If we do not spend time reading the Bible or know the Bible well, having little light or experience, we will be able to give others only knowledge and doctrine, not real help. Today the education level in Taiwan is rather high, such that even a newly saved brother in junior high school will have many questions concerning the Bible. He may ask why he should read the Bible, what the Bible is, and what is its source and content. We should explain that the Bible is God-breathed, that we can know and gain the Lord by reading the Bible, and that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. However, we must remember to be very careful when answering questions. When we say that the Bible is God-breathed, he may want to know what we mean by God-breathed. Perhaps we would say that the Bible is the word of God, but he may ask why the Bible is the word of God and what <em>the word of God</em> means. Hence, we must be careful and thoughtful when we answer the questions of a new believer in order to not introduce more questions. This requires learning. Since we are serving full time, we must be prepared by using the publications and reading the Bible as often as we can. We must cultivate and build up these matters first in ourselves.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping with the Lord,<br />
Being Enlightened, and Confessing Our Sins</h2>
<p>In leading the new believers we must first help them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel. We should spend more time in preaching the gospel, helping them to be active in approaching non-believers and speaking the gospel. However, these four matters are outward; they are related to practice. We still need to help the new believers to enter into their spirit. According to our experience, in addition to helping them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel, we also need to help them learn to fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Fellowshipping with the Lord is a general subject, but it involves many items. To fellowship with the Lord is to contact the Lord, and such contact with the Lord takes place mainly during our prayer or reading the Bible. While praying and reading the Word, we contact the Lord and fellowship with Him. This brings in His shining, and thus we are enlightened. On the one hand, the Lord uses His Word, the Bible, to shine on us. On the other hand, the Spirit of the Lord within us gives us a spiritual sense and speaks to us. This sense and the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking also enlighten us.</p>
<p>We should help new believers according to our experience. We may point out to them that when we are newly saved, the Lord speaks to us mainly through His shining. The Lord may show us that we are wrong in the way that we treat our parents, our children, our spouse, our neighbors, or our colleagues. Then we should confess these sins to the Lord in prayer. Whatever sins we sense within, we should confess one by one to the Lord. This is how to confess our sins; it is also how to deal with our sins.</p>
<p>After helping them learn to confess their sins, we need to speak to new believers concerning being cleansed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood. We can read 1 John 1:9 and the second part of verse 7 with them. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; Verse 7 says, &ldquo;The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&rdquo; When a believer understands these two verses, he will realize his need to confess his sins and allow God to forgive and cleanse him. Such a cleansing is through the precious blood of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecration</h2>
<p>These examples are for our training. The first step in our work is to preach the gospel. Then we should lead the saved ones to live the Christian life. We first lead them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel. Then we lead them to fellowship with the Lord and to receive His shining through prayer and reading the Bible. Furthermore, we should lead them to confess and deal with their sins and to experience the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood. At this point, some of the new believers may be touched by the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit to present themselves to the Lord. This is consecration. Some may offer themselves in this way, not as a result of the Spirit&rsquo;s leading in life but as the issue of our teaching. We cannot say that this is wrong; nevertheless, it is better if a new believer, after having dealt with his sins, would have a spontaneous desire within his spirit to consecrate himself to the Lord and thus pray, &ldquo;Lord, I truly love You, and I desire to give myself and my whole life to You.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking according to the Spirit</h2>
<p>After a believer consecrates himself, we should lead him to take another step forward. According to the life of a normal Christian, after consecration he should learn to walk according to the spirit. Hence, we need to help him by explaining that he is one with the Lord. This means that the Lord who is in him can lead him, and that his living and conduct, his intentions, thoughts, speech, and attitude should follow the inner feeling that the Spirit gives him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Anointing</h2>
<p>After new ones learn to walk according to the spirit, we need to bring them into the anointing, or we may say the teaching of the anointing. This is an important matter. After helping new ones to fellowship with the Lord, to be enlightened, to confess their sins, and to consecrate themselves, we should help them to walk according to the spirit. Then we should point out that they have the anointing within them. We should tell them that the Lord is the Spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit is the ointment. All His actions within us are the anointing. This anointing within us is teaching us. We should help them as much as we can. The more help we render, the better. We must let them know that by the anointing the Lord gives us a feeling, and we should walk according to this feeling. Then we can give them an illustration: When we apply ointment to our skin, we have a sensation. Similarly, when the Spirit as the ointment anoints us within, we have a sensation, and we should walk according to the anointing, that is, according to the sensation. This is to walk according to the spirit. If a believer can live and move according to the anointing, he will advance in his spiritual life.</p>
<p>We need to learn many lessons because our ability to render help to others depends on how much we have experienced the anointing. If we do not have adequate knowledge of the anointing or the teaching of the anointing, we should get help from our publications. We should find the relevant books and study them and practice what we learn from the books. It is only when we know and experience the anointing that we can render help to others.</p><h2 class="head2">The Experience of Life Being a Cycle</h2>
<p>Leading new believers in the life practices of praying, reading the Bible, meeting with the saints, and preaching the gospel can be considered as only &ldquo;elementary education.&rdquo; Therefore, we should lead them into fellowshipping with the Lord, being enlightened, and dealing with their sins so that there are no barriers between them and the Lord. We should also lead them to consecrate themselves fully to the Lord, walk according to the spirit, and know the anointing. In terms of spiritual experience, these items can be considered as being &ldquo;high school education.&rdquo; A person who knows the anointing may be considered rather advanced in the growth in life. However, in spiritual matters there is the principle of a cycle. In the educational system in schools, after learning math and history at the elementary level, we do not need to relearn them later. However, spiritual matters are different. The experiences in the divine life are always repetitive, forming a cycle. Hence, even after we know the anointing, we still need to pray, read the Bible, meet, and preach the gospel. Furthermore, we must continue to fellowship with the Lord, to be enlightened, and to deal with our sins. We will never graduate from these matters. We may graduate from a school curriculum, but the experiences of our spiritual life are a cycle from which we never graduate.</p>
<p>I have been in the Lord for sixty years, but I still need to pray and read the Bible every day, to meet regularly, and to preach the gospel. I still need to fellowship with the Lord, and I need the Lord to speak to me. Moreover, I still need to be enlightened, to confess my sins, and to consecrate myself day by day and moment by moment. We all have had the experience of being on the altar one moment and coming down from the altar the next moment. When we fellowship with the Lord, we are on the altar, but we often come down from the altar. Our life as a Christian is a life of being on the altar and off the altar. According to the truth, a person cannot come down from the cross after he is crucified. Nevertheless, even though a person cannot come down from the cross after being crucified, he can come down from the altar after being on the altar. This is confirmed by our experience. Hence, we need to consecrate ourselves repeatedly. After consecrating ourselves, we should ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to grant us the grace to walk according to the spirit. Besides these items of the Christian life, we need to experience the anointing continually. The points mentioned above are a main portion in the experience of life. We ourselves need to learn these experiences, and we need to lead others into these experiences as a cycle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE BIBLE AS THE BASE OF OUR WORK</h2>
<p>The most effective way to lead people is to use the Bible. Hence, we should know appropriate verses for every topic. In leading new believers to live the Christian life, we should first help them to pray. There are many verses in the Bible related to prayer, but we need to find the most appropriate verses.</p>
<p>In the same way, in helping others to read the Bible, we also need to use appropriate verses. For instance, 2 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; It is best to use this verse with verse 15, which says, &ldquo;The sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; We must learn to use these two verses when helping people read the Bible. Hence, we need more training and practice related to using appropriate verses. Otherwise, when we go out to contact people, we will be like an unskilled cook who, even though he has many ingredients, cannot prepare a delicious dish. There are many verses concerning going to meetings, preaching the gospel, fellowshipping with the Lord, and being enlightened. Furthermore, we should find relevant verses concerning the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to us through the Spirit, knowing the sense of life from the Lord, dealing with our sins in the light, and consecrating ourselves to the Lord. We also need verses concerning walking according to the spirit and knowing the anointing. We need to find all the relevant verses. This will make our contact with people more effective. As the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones, we should learn these things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK IN TAIWAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Need to Purchase Land for<br />
a Big Meeting Hall</h2>
<p>According to the development of all the churches in Taiwan, especially in the Taipei region, we will need a big meeting hall with facilities to provide hospitality. If such a meeting hall were available, some saints in a district in Taipei could bring a group of new believers there and live the church life together for three days. After that, another group of saints could take a group of new believers there. In this way the facility would be constantly occupied. The meeting hall will not be for regular meetings in the Taipei area but for special needs in the work, such as gospel meetings or weekend perfecting trainings. In the future we will have such a need. I believe that such a meeting hall would be used every day. The saints in other localities in Taiwan also could use the facility. Hence, we need to bear this burden and pray for this matter. May the Lord work in many ways to accomplish this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having an Enlarged View</h2>
<p>We should not regard lightly the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan. The Lord has truly done a great thing here. Taiwan has a rare environment: twenty million people populate this island, there is good transportation, and the level of education is high. In addition, we have a large number of saints. My main burden is that we would make use of these resources.</p>
<p>For the last few years I have felt that the church in Taipei has many resources and can be compared to a large company that possesses much capital. However, we have not touched our resources; instead, they lie waste. Our burden is to stir us up to use every resource. This stirring up will have a deep and far-reaching effect. We can compare this to throwing a large stone into the ocean and creating waves, which, if they are strong enough, will spread to the major continents. In recent months I have been traveling between the two coasts of the Pacific to stir up the saints. We hope that in thirty years some of the young people among us will be greatly used by the Lord. By then they will be in their fifties, which are our most useful years in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Their future will be unlimited. We all need to be enlarged in our view to realize that what we are learning today is not only for us in Taipei but also for the future of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is a great need. In the past we said that we would be willing to sell everything we have for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. However, the Lord has never asked us to sell anything. In April 1925, after I was saved, I consecrated myself to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I do not want the world anymore. After I finish my studies, I will go with my Bible from village to village to preach the gospel. I am willing to do this even if I must live on tree roots and drink from mountain brooks.&rdquo; That was my consecration. However, the Lord has had mercy on me. I never had to eat tree roots or drink mountain water. Furthermore, He did not lead me to go from village to village but rather from continent to continent. Who can say what our future will be? Sixty years ago I was only a young student. I was twenty years old, and I gave myself to the Lord, never expecting that He would use me, a Chinese young man, to spread His recovery to the five continents. Now about six hundred churches have been raised up. This is truly the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>On every continent doors are opening to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. However, we are short of people and cannot meet this need. We all must wake up in order to see our true condition. The work in Taiwan must have an epochal change so that we may meet the Lord&rsquo;s need. We must all realize this need and receive the burden to pray for it.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how to preach the gospel. After young people consecrate themselves to serve full time, the first thing they need to do is preach the gospel. However, what is the best way to preach the gospel? When we preach the gospel, our main goal is to be effective. To be effective means to get people saved. If we speak vividly and eloquently, but no one gets saved, our gospel preaching is a failure. Hence, it is crucial for us to learn how to preach the gospel effectively.</p>
<p>Some say that the best way to preach the gospel is to sing hymns. This is not wrong; it is one way to preach the gospel. However, singing hymns as the first step in preaching the gospel can be compared to walking with one&rsquo;s hands. Others say that the best way is to use the booklet <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> which uses four keys to preach the gospel. The key of God&rsquo;s creation unlocks the mystery of human existence, the key of man&rsquo;s fall unlocks the mystery of the two natures of man, the key of Christ&rsquo;s redemption unlocks the mystery of the God-man, and the key of God&rsquo;s dispensing unlocks the mystery of faith. Lastly, it tells a person how to receive the gospel. This is good material for preaching the gospel, but we need to begin preaching the gospel from a basic level.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENERAL WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being a Person with a Spirit of the Gospel</h2>
<p>We must consider the matter of preaching the gospel from the most basic level. A certain kind of task requires a certain kind of person. If we want to preach the gospel, we must be persons who are for the gospel. As soon as the apostle Paul was saved, he proclaimed Jesus Christ (Acts 9:20-22). This is the first thing that he did. Every serving one, including the New Testament apostles, such as Peter and John, and those throughout church history, such as Moody and Spurgeon, begins his service by preaching the gospel. Every person who is saved and loves the Lord has a spirit of the gospel, the desire to preach the gospel. In particular, those who love the Lord and consecrate themselves to the Lord have a strong desire to preach the gospel. We all must be persons who preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Immediately after I was saved, I felt within that I should preach the gospel. At that time no one was shepherding me. Furthermore, in Chefoo the members in the various denominations were very cold toward preaching the gospel. It seemed as if I was the only person who was zealous for the gospel. I went to the villages to preach the gospel every Lord&rsquo;s Day. Since there were no buses, I walked. I would walk about twenty miles in a day. By the time I returned home, I would be exhausted. Nevertheless, I did not cease preaching the gospel. There was a shortage of gospel material, so there were no gospel tracts for purchase. Hence, I began to write gospel tracts. This spirit of the gospel is in every one of us, but some of us suppress it instead of cultivating it. The spirit of the gospel is like fire that can either be extinguished or set ablaze. Hence, we need to cultivate the spirit of the gospel, and we even need to fan it into flame. The bigger the fire, the better.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying to Kindle the Fire of the Gospel</h2>
<p>In order to preach the gospel, we first must be a person for the gospel, having the spirit of the gospel. Next, we must pray. If we lack prayer, all our labor will be in vain. Therefore, we must pray. However, we should not pray for any specific persons; our prayer should be general. We should pray for the Lord to strengthen the spirit of the gospel within us so that the fire of the gospel would burn among us. Furthermore, we must pray for the Lord to give us a heart of love toward men, to give us a sense of urgency toward the thousands of people who are perishing every day, and especially to give us an interest in sinners and a desire to contact them. This kind of prayer fans the fire of the gospel into flame; the more we pray, the more the fire of the gospel will be burning in us. Eventually, when we see a sinner, we will be moved to tears, and we will love the unbelievers. The young saints should exercise in this way. If we feel nothing in our heart when we see people, the gospel tracts that we give them will be cold. However, if the fire of the gospel is burning within us, we will be burdened when we think of the unbelievers going to the lake of fire. Then every tract that we give out will touch people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>If the fire of the gospel is kindled within us, we will become crazy for the gospel and go everywhere to preach the gospel. The young people should be crazy for the gospel on their college campuses. Whenever they see an unbeliever, they should be enlivened, even to the point that they forget about eating and care only for the gospel. We should distribute gospel tracts and booklets every day. When I was young, there were always gospel tracts in my pocket. On my way to and from work, I would give them to the people I met. We should never be without gospel tracts, and we should give them to everyone we see. Whether we are in a store or eating in a restaurant, we should give out gospel tracts. If we are the kind of people who preach the gospel everywhere, we will see the effect of the gospel. The economical Spirit, the Spirit of power, will be upon us, and we will be full of power in the gospel.</p>
<p>What I have fellowshipped is the common way, the general way to preach the gospel. Every full-time serving one must have this experience. We must be on fire for the gospel, crazy for the gospel, for at least two to three years. All those who are crazy for the gospel will become thick-skinned, bold, not shy. If we have not already learned this spiritual lesson, we must make it up. All the young ones who are serving the Lord full time must be crazy for the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">SPECIFIC WAYS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Praying for Specific Ones by Name<br />
and Knowing the Gospel</h2>
<p>We have practiced the common and general way to preach the gospel. Now we will enter into specific ways to preach the gospel. The Lord will give us a special burden for certain ones among our relatives, friends, and classmates. We should pray for these ones by name. This is specific prayer. We must also know the gospel. This requires learning. We need to get into the Life-studies and the spiritual books so that we may know the content of the gospel. The first item of the gospel is God, the second is man, and the third is sins. We need to know God, man, and sins. We also need to know Jesus Christ as the Savior, know redemption, and know how people can believe in the Lord. When we preach the gospel, we need to speak of faith and of repentance. When a person repents and believes, the issue is the forgiveness of his sins. Then there is justification and reconciliation to God. We need to know all these steps. Furthermore, we need to know what is cleansing from sins, what is release from bondage, and what is regeneration. After experiencing these few steps, a person is saved. These are the contents of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Practicing to Speak</h2>
<p>Besides studying the contents of the gospel, we also need to practice speaking the gospel to others. If there is no audience to practice with, we can practice in front of a mirror at home. We should practice speaking concerning God, man, sins, the Savior, and redemption. As we practice in this way, we will become skilled. This can be compared to playing basketball; a player is required to be skilled in all the basic movements so that he will be able to handle the ball with ease, knowing how to receive and pass the ball.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Finding and Memorizing Appropriate Bible Verses</h2>
<p>We should also find effective and appropriate verses and memorize them. Some brothers and sisters want to quote the Bible when they preach the gospel, but they do not know where the verses are and spend their time searching the pages of the Bible. As a result, the listener is distracted. One thing we should pay attention to is avoiding distractions when preaching the gospel. Moody&rsquo;s experience is an example. One evening Moody was preaching the gospel to someone. At a key moment, when this one was about to receive the Lord, another person came into the room and closed his umbrella. This noise distracted the gospel friend, and she did not get saved. Not only should there not be any distractions when we speak the gospel to others, but there is also the matter of timing. Sometimes someone is ready to be saved, but not being conscious of it, we continue speaking. Eventually, after we finish speaking, the gospel friend may argue with us instead of believing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Discern People</h2>
<p>We should not speak to people about God as if we are going through a list of points in a lecture. Sometimes we should speak with one person concerning only one point and speak with another person concerning a different point. When we contact people, we must be clear that what we say depends on whom we are talking to. We may speak concerning God or concerning man&rsquo;s condition, because different people have different needs. Hence, we must have some knowledge about the person we are speaking with. In the outlines of the service training that was held in 1953, there is a section related to preaching the gospel that contains different categories of people. We should study those points (see &ldquo;How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel&rdquo; in <em>Fellowship concerning the Urgent Need of the Vital Groups</em>). If we practice using these points, when we contact someone, we will know what kind of person he is. We will be like a good carpenter who knows how to work with different types of wood. We need to spend time to study the different categories of people so as to learn how to speak with people and which verses to use.</p>
<p>I have been saved for sixty years, yet sometimes I still feel inadequate when preaching the gospel. How to preach the gospel is a big subject that we need to study. I once spent three hours preaching the gospel to a person. I wanted to save him, and he also wanted to be saved, but he did not get saved. Later, Brother Nee preached the gospel to him, and within five minutes he was saved. Hence, we need to learn the skill of preaching the gospel. We should make an effort to learn this skill. Either we can study by ourselves, or we can learn from those who are more experienced in preaching the gospel so that our gospel preaching will be effective.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Various Items in Leading People to Be Saved</h2>
<p>So far we have fellowshipped concerning what we need to learn before we lead people to salvation. There are still more skills that we need to pay attention to while we are preaching the gospel. For example, we must help a person to pray, but we cannot do this in a formal way. Rather, we must observe the situation; only when it is the proper time to pray should we lead a person to pray. This requires discernment. In some situations, we need to lead a person to pray sentence by sentence; we pray one sentence, and they repeat the sentence. With one person we may need to kneel down and pray, but with another person we should not compel him to kneel down. Every situation is different.</p>
<p>The principle is the same when we lead a person to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We may lead someone to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name three times for him to receive salvation. However, this is not a formula that can be applied in every situation. The way we lead a person depends on the situation. It may be sufficient for one person to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name three times, but another person may need to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name more than thirty times. On the one hand, it is a matter of skill. On the other hand, different people go through different processes to receive salvation. Hence, we must learn many lessons in order to preach the gospel. We should never think that our gospel preaching will be the same in every situation. In the past we were unable to lead people to salvation, but if we are willing to learn, we will see results within a month.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING UNTIL WE ARE SKILLED</h2>
<p>When we preach the gospel, the most important thing for us to learn is how to use the Bible and how to be flexible in using the Bible. We should spend time to practice. We may not thoroughly understand the contents of the gospel even after reading many books. We should endeavor to memorize verses and the main points from the books so that we may freely speak the gospel. In this way we will be able to speak freely with people concerning the gospel, using any verse. We must practice until we are skilled. If we are well-versed in all the points of the gospel, whether we are preaching the gospel on a campus or in a home gathering, the people we contact will be saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING TO THE VILLAGES TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>From this time onward, we must promote the gospel on the island of Taiwan. First, every home must preach the gospel. Second, we must preach the gospel to people in every occupation. Third, we must preach the gospel in middle schools and on college campuses. Fourth, we must go to the villages and towns to preach the gospel. We can all go to the campuses to preach the gospel. Many of us must go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel. It would be good if every meeting hall in every church could send one small group of saints to preach the gospel in the villages every Lord&rsquo;s Day. We must spread the gospel and not merely have meetings. In particular, in the future the full-timers who are in this training should go to other places to preach the gospel. According to Matthew 10, we should go out to preach the gospel. We go out in groups. Several brothers and sisters can form a group and go to a village. They can stay there for three to four days and preach the gospel there.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of five brothers in America went to different places that do not have a church and preached the gospel on the campuses. They went to a university in the state of Louisiana, but they were turned away by the school authorities. Later they had a meeting with the president of the university, who allowed them to stay there and even provided a place on campus for them to preach the gospel. Many students in that place have been baptized. In the same principle, we need groups of four to five brothers and sisters to go to villages and towns. I believe that the Lord will arrange for many Taiwanese-speaking saints to go to the villages. In the future the young ones should spend a long time in the villages to preach and spread the gospel. We should not be in a hurry to establish churches. We should first be diligent to preach the gospel. All the full-time trainees should be the first group to learn these lessons and go preach the gospel. Based on these instructions, we should find the relevant information from the books and study on our own or with companions so that we are equipped. The results depend on how much effort we put in. Hence, we need to study and work hard. The young people must not be idle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: At present, there is a good response among the college students to the gospel, but it is not easy for them to be baptized. Some students feel that to be baptized is to join a religion and are concerned about the opposition from their family. Other students who have a positive response to the gospel want to wait until the time is right to be baptized. How can we help the students take the next step and be baptized?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must pray and ask the Lord to give us the economical Spirit. Preaching the gospel requires power. We must pray for this, but we should not take the way of the charismatic or Pentecostal movements. We should tell the Lord to give us the experience, not feelings; we want to experience the economical Spirit. For a person to be willing to believe requires the work of the Holy Spirit. For a person to be willing to be baptized requires even more of the work of the Holy Spirit. Merely using methods to persuade people to be baptized is human manufacturing. We must look to the Lord to give us the economical Spirit; we need the presence of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, the best way is to take people to the mountain. It is not so easy to lead people to be baptized if we are in a home or in a school; however, if we take people to the mountain and spend a few days together, it will be very easy to lead them to be baptized. Human beings are living organisms with feelings and emotions. A person will respond one way when he feels cold in one setting and differently when he feels warm in another setting. So we must consider these two factors: the economical Spirit and the setting.</p>
<p><em>Question: Recently more than a hundred young people were gained and baptized. We hope that they can live a normal Christian life and can also preach the gospel to others. However, since they have recently been saved, it is not possible for them to know the Bible well or to have read many spiritual books. Is it possible to collect crucial verses with simple explanations into a booklet so that these young people can become familiar with these items in a short period of time and use them to speak to others?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Everything depends on us. We have the materials, but we need some saints to dig out the treasures, to digest them, and to compile them into booklets or tracts. This is the right method, and it will be useful. Furthermore, in the future we can compile material from these treasures that would be suitable for children&rsquo;s meetings. We should not use worldly material for the children&rsquo;s meetings. We should digest the main points of the truth and turn them into simple words so that we can speak the truth to the children.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO QUOTE<br />
THE SCRIPTURES ACCURATELY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LAYING A GOOD FOUNDATION<br />
IN SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we said that we should use appropriate verses when we shepherd the new believers. In this chapter we will consider this matter further. Quoting the Bible can be compared to practicing Chinese calligraphy: one must practice according to set rules. For example, a beginner should practice writing in standard type, which is the foundation of Chinese calligraphy. If a person cannot write the standard type properly, he will be unable to write in running style, in script type, or in seal type. Hence, the young people who are learning to serve the Lord should practice according to rules so that they can lay a good foundation.</p>
<p>When a carpenter wants to make furniture, he starts off with a big pile of wood, and each piece of wood varies in texture and size. One piece may be best for a tabletop, and another piece may be best for a door. If he wants to make an end table, he will carefully choose a piece of wood that is suitable in quality, color, size, and thickness so that the end table will be beautiful and so that he will save time and materials. A carpenter who randomly selects a piece of wood will waste time cutting it to the right size, proving that he is not a trained carpenter. Similarly, when a Christian quotes the Scriptures, he should not randomly use any verse. This is inappropriate. The Bible is very rich. Although there are hundreds of verses on prayer, we cannot use them in a random way. Selecting the right verse can also be compared to selecting appropriate fabric for a spring outfit. We must not be careless. Regrettably, many Christians quote the Bible carelessly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Verses for Leading<br />
the New Believers to Pray</h2>
<p>There are many verses in the Bible concerning prayer in the Christian life, but which verses should we use with new believers? Let us consider some verses. Ephesians 6:18 says, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; This is a good verse, but it should not be the first verse that we use. First Thessalonians 5:17 says, &ldquo;Unceasingly pray.&rdquo; This verse is more suitable than Ephesians 6:18, but it is still not the most suitable verse to begin with. Philippians 4:6 says, &ldquo;In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.&rdquo; This is the best verse for comforting people, but it is still not suitable for helping new believers to learn to pray. Matthew 6:9-13 is commonly called the Lord&rsquo;s prayer. Using these verses to teach new believers to pray is the same as being in the denominations and teaching people to recite the Lord&rsquo;s prayer. Even Matthew 7:7-8, which says, &ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives,&rdquo; is not appropriate to use at first. Jude 20 says, &ldquo;You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse is more appropriate, but the book of Jude is too deep for new believers.</p>
<p>John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; This verse is not speaking of how to pray. Hebrews 4:16 is more appropriate: &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.&rdquo; However, this verse does not have the word <em>prayer</em>. Helping new believers is like teaching children in kindergarten. We need a verse that has the word <em>prayer.</em> Acts 6:4 says, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; However, steadfast prayer is related to the service of the apostles, not to the prayer of new believers.</p>
<p>Acts 2:42 says, &ldquo;They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; This verse is appropriate for helping new believers. Three thousand new believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread, and in prayer. Following this verse, we should use Jude 20. When helping new believers to live the Christian life, we should first lead them to pray. The basis for this is Acts 2:42. After the first group of believers were saved, they continued steadfastly not only in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles but also in the breaking of bread and in prayer. The teaching and fellowship of the apostles and the breaking of bread are part of the church life, but prayer cannot be limited to just the church life. Prayer must be a part of a Christian&rsquo;s personal life. Hence, this is the first verse that we should use. First Thessalonians 5:17 can be next, and then we can use Ephesians 6:18. These three verses are sufficient. There is no need to use many verses. In order to shepherd new believers, we must learn how to find appropriate verses. This kind of study helps us to be equipped.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Clear concerning the Contents<br />
of God&rsquo;s Salvation</h2>
<p>Now we will consider salvation. Salvation is God Himself coming to us to be our salvation. Salvation includes forgiveness of sins, cleansing from sins, justification, reconciliation to God, and regeneration. Is a person saved and then justified and forgiven of his sin? Is a person saved and then cleansed by the blood and reconciled to God? Or is a person saved and then regenerated? Which is the first item that we experience: justification, forgiveness of sins, cleansing from sins, reconciliation, regeneration, or salvation? Is a person regenerated and then saved, or is he saved and then regenerated? We must remember that being saved is the last item. When helping others to be saved, we must be clear concerning this.</p>
<p>Some of you may think that it is good enough to lead people to salvation and question why you need to learn these items. I have seen many believers who led people to salvation but were unable to help them advance in life. There have been powerful evangelists who have not cared for the truth of the gospel. As a result, those whom they brought to salvation did not have much growth in life. While preaching the gospel, one evangelist spoke about the precious blood washing his heart and the precious blood leaking out. Many people were saved because his spirit was strong. However, it was difficult for those who were saved to be led further in the growth in life because his understanding of the truth was not accurate.</p>
<p>In Shangtung Province of northern China many believers in the Pentecostal movement were able to lead people to salvation. However, the content of their preaching was shallow. While bringing people to their service on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, they would sing a folk chorus: &ldquo;You are busy, and I am busy too. You are busy burning incense, and I am busy going to heaven.&rdquo; The ones who were saved could not understand what the growth in life had to do with going to heaven. Since they were taught that they were going to heaven, it was very difficult for them to advance in life. Therefore, as we preach the gospel to bring people to salvation, we must not use the Scriptures carelessly or speak the truth inaccurately; otherwise, those who are led to salvation will not be able to progress.</p>
<p>This can be likened to learning English. If your teacher is so careless that you can neither differentiate nor pronounce the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, you will not be able to learn English. However, learning to recognize and clearly pronounce each letter of the alphabet will be a solid foundation toward your learning English. When I learned English as a young boy, my teacher was Cantonese. As a result, my spoken English has a Cantonese accent. It was not until I entered college that I was taught by Americans. By that time it was not so easy for me to change my accent. Therefore, as the young people begin to serve the Lord, they must learn all the basic lessons in a solid way. If they learn the lessons well, it will be a great help to them in the future.</p>
<p>I have studied the contents of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation for fifty-five years. In 1938 I led the brothers and sisters in Chefoo to study forty-two topics of the crucial truths in the Bible. In 1949 I studied it with the saints in Taipei, and I added another eighteen topics. These sixty topics, including the relevant verses, were later published in a set of books. This compilation is entitled <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures,</em> volumes 1 through 6. In these books the matter of God&rsquo;s salvation is thoroughly discussed.</p>
<p>The first item of God&rsquo;s salvation is forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43). The second item is cleansing from sins (1 John 1:9). After we are cleansed, God justifies us (Rom. 3:26), and we are released from our sins (Rev. 1:5). Hence, we are reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10), and we are regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3). At this point, we are saved. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13). The word <em>saved</em> includes forgiveness, cleansing, justification, release, and reconciliation. All of these matters are accomplished in the twinkling of an eye. The Spirit of God enters into us, and we are regenerated and saved.</p>
<p>However, there is still the matter of sanctification. There are two different stages of sanctification: sanctification before salvation and sanctification after salvation. Romans 6:19 and 22 stress sanctification after salvation, that is, after justification. First Corinthians 6:11 speaks of sanctification before salvation, that is, before justification. This verse says, &ldquo;But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&rdquo; According to this verse, sanctification is placed after forgiveness and cleansing, being washed, but before justification. Hence, we can say that God&rsquo;s salvation includes seven items: forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, release, reconciliation, and regeneration, and then the eighth and last item&mdash;salvation. When we preach the gospel, we should speak according to this truth, not carelessly. If we do not lay a good foundation, it will be difficult to shepherd people in the growth in life. This is not a small thing; we must learn it.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:2 also speaks of sanctification before salvation. This verse says that we were &ldquo;chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; According to this verse, sanctification should be the first item of God&rsquo;s salvation. God chose us in eternity, in time the Holy Spirit separates us through His sanctifying work, and then the blood is sprinkled on us. After we are sprinkled with the blood, God forgives us and cleanses us. He also justifies us, releases us from our sins, and reconciles us to Himself. Then God regenerates us, and the result is our being saved. Hence, according to 1 Peter 1 sanctification is the first item that we experience. This fellowship is to show you that it is worthwhile to study the truth. If we do not study the truth thoroughly, the truth will not regulate us when we preach the gospel.</p>
<p>To say that the precious blood washes our heart is not accurate, because Hebrews 10:22 says that the precious blood does not wash our heart but our conscience. Our conscience represents the law of God; the law of God corresponds to our conscience. Before God the precious blood washes us of our sins on the basis of the law, and within us the precious blood washes us of all our guilty feelings within our conscience. The blood does not wash our heart. &ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable&rdquo; (Jer. 17:9). Only regeneration can renew and transform our heart.</p>
<p>Medical students are required to spend several years studying fundamental courses concerning the structure and composition of the human body. A medical student must acquire this basic knowledge so that he will not make mistakes in his diagnosis or prescription. Likewise, when we go out to preach the gospel, we should not be incompetent doctors. We need to learn diligently. There is no end to our learning. The young ones must receive a solid basic training before going out. Then they will not make many mistakes.</p>
<p>When we are clear concerning the contents of God&rsquo;s salvation, we will have confidence when we preach the gospel. When we speak concerning regeneration, we will remember that regeneration comes after six items. It is not until a person is reconciled with God that the Spirit of God can enter into him and put God&rsquo;s life in him. Then a person is regenerated and saved. Salvation is the last item.</p><h2 class="head2">Appropriate Verses concerning Being Saved</h2>
<p>Now we will consider the most suitable verses to use when speaking about being saved. The first part of Mark 16:16 says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; We can match this verse with Romans 10:13: &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why should we use Mark 16:16 first? In verses 15 and 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation. He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.&rdquo; In Acts 16:31 Paul and Silas said to the jailer in Philippi, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; This verse is also very good. Both of these verses are good because they say that the condition for being saved is to believe. Salvation in these two verses refers to sanctification, forgiveness, cleansing, justification, release, reconciliation, and regeneration.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul says that we should cut &ldquo;straight the word of the truth.&rdquo; Releasing God&rsquo;s word can be compared to a surgeon performing an operation. A surgeon cannot be careless; he must be precise. In the Recovery Version of the New Testament the footnote to this verse says that the phrase <em>cutting straight</em> is likened to cutting wood. Hence, to cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. We should not be confused when we use a verse. Therefore, we need to spend time to learn the lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Will Mark 16:16 cause people to misunderstand baptism as a condition for being saved?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Strictly speaking, in order to be saved, one needs to be baptized. If our gospel preaching is powerful enough, a person&rsquo;s salvation will include baptism. In Acts 2:37-38 after the Jews heard the gospel, they were pricked in their heart, and they asked the disciples what they should do. Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Hence, if our gospel preaching is powerful, people will be baptized. Repentance includes baptism because baptism means burial, which is a genuine change of mind.</p>
<p><em>Question: During one of our visits, we encountered a gospel friend who had a desire to be saved, but because of the confusion in Christianity and the undesirable behavior of some Christians, he was hesitant. In his thought he could be saved only after he understood the Bible. Even though we read Romans 10:13 and Mark 16:16, because of the poor behavior of many Christians, he questioned this salvation. We attempted to differentiate between being saved and overcoming, but he could not accept our explanation. We do not know how to help him.</em></p>
<p>Answer: The question posed by this gospel friend cannot be solved with just one appropriate verse. Nevertheless, we can use the following illustration to help him. A baby needs to be in the womb for nine months before it is born. Before a baby is born, we do not whether he will grow up to be strong. Furthermore, if a few days after birth a baby dies because of an illness, we cannot say that his birth was false. Death is a result of inadequate care after the baby was born. Hence, Christians who are genuinely saved but lack care might have inappropriate behavior. Some people are indeed saved; however, after being saved, they remain like babies. When a baby is conceived, it does not know anything. Even after it is born, it still does not know much. However, after it is born, its life has the capacity to learn. We are regenerated through God&rsquo;s word and of God&rsquo;s life. Regeneration is not based on our understanding. Rather, one is regenerated because he receives God&rsquo;s life with its life element. After being regenerated, a person has the capacity to know and learn all things related to the Christian life. This situation shows that when you preach the gospel, not only must you be clear concerning the truth; you also need to be equipped with examples based on the truth so that you can give an illustration to help people.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">HELPING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the first item to shepherd a new believer into immediately after he is saved. We need to help every new believer to have the assurance of salvation. After a person is genuinely saved by believing in the Lord and calling on His name, we should not rejoice and walk away from him. This can be compared to wrapping a package with rope without tying a knot. After two or three days, the rope will loosen and the packaging will fall off. In order to &ldquo;tie a tight and secure knot&rdquo; for someone who is newly saved, we need to help him have the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>We can also use the example of purchasing a house. After purchasing a house, you must be sure that you have a legal document, the title deed, in your hand. The title deed is the evidence of possession. You know that you own the house and the land because you have the title deed. The assurance of salvation is the &ldquo;title deed&rdquo; to salvation. After leading a person to salvation, we must immediately help him to obtain the &ldquo;title deed&rdquo; to his salvation, that is, the sure proof of his salvation. This proof, or &ldquo;title deed,&rdquo; is the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Outward Proof&mdash;<br />
the Word of God (1 John 5:13)</h2>
<p>Let us consider some appropriate verses. A brother said that Ephesians 1:13 is a good verse: &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&rdquo; Although this is a word of assurance, this verse should not be used too early when speaking to new believers. Others have suggested Ephesians 2:8: &ldquo;By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God&rdquo;; Acts 16:31: &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo;; and John 3:16: &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; These verses are words of assurance, but they are not the most appropriate, effective, and explicit statements regarding the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>John 10:28-29 says, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; These two verses do not speak of the assurance of salvation but of the security of salvation. According to these verses, there are two hands&mdash;the hand of the Lord and the hand of the Father&mdash;holding us; hence, our salvation is secure. Hebrews 1:3 says that the Lord upholds and bears all things by the word of His power. God&rsquo;s hand upholds the earth, and this same hand upholds all the believers. Hence, every saved one is secure in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The best verse to use for the proof, the title deed, of salvation is 1 John 5:13, which says, &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.&rdquo; The phrase <em>these things</em> refers to what is written in the Bible. An example is verse 12, which says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; After reading verse 12 with a new believer, we can ask whether he has the Son of God. He might say that he does not know. At which point we should read both verses 12 and 13 to him. Then we should tell him that he has believed in the Lord and called on His name. The Lord&rsquo;s name is the Lord Himself. Since he has called on the Lord and is saved, he has the Lord, the Son of God. We can ask him again whether he has the Son of God. After listening to what we say, he will know that he has the Son of God. Then we should read verse 12 with him again and ask him whether he has the life. He might answer that he does not feel that he has it. We should tell him that it is not a matter of feeling but of fact. Using the purchase of a house as an example, we can say that after a person receives the title deed for a house, that house is his regardless of whether he feels it or not. It does not matter how he feels. What matters is that he has the title deed.</p>
<p>On the title deed of a house there are official statements that are approved by government agencies. These statements prove the ownership of the house. In the Bible there are many such &ldquo;official statements.&rdquo; We can read these statements to a new believer and tell him that these words are written for us so that we may know that we have eternal life. One official statement is Romans 10:13, which says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; Another is John 1:12: &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&rdquo; We can tell him that by these words he knows that he has the life of God, and he also has the authority to become a child of God. Hence, God&rsquo;s word is the greatest proof that we have for the assurance of our salvation. There are many words concerning the assurance of our salvation in chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the Gospel of John as well as in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p><h2 class="head2">The Inward Proof&mdash;<br />
the Spirit of God (Romans 8:15-16)</h2>
<p>The outward proof for the assurance of salvation is God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible. The Bible is our title deed; this is our outward proof. However, when a person is saved, he not only has outward proof but also inward proof. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; This verse shows that the Spirit of God is our inward proof. The outward proof is the Word of God, and the inward proof is the Spirit of God. We need to speak this verse repeatedly to new believers, because this verse is difficult to understand. It is difficult to comprehend how the Spirit of God witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. We should point out to a new believer that since he is saved, he can say that he is a child of God. If he is not sure of this, we should lead him to call, &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; and we can tell him that if someone is not your father, you would feel reluctant to call him father. However, Romans 8:15 says that the Spirit we have received is the spirit of sonship. Hence, we do not have any reluctance to call, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; Rather, this is something spontaneous. Formerly we were sinners, but now we can call God &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; This is the witnessing of the Holy Spirit with our spirit that we are children of God.</p>
<p>When Brother Nee was young, a brother asked him about the meaning of Romans 8:16. Brother Nee knew that this brother was married. So he asked the brother how he addressed his father-in-law after he was married. The brother said that he called his father-in-law &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; even though it was very difficult. Brother Nee said that it is not easy to call a father-in-law &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; but it is very sweet to call our own father &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; because we are born of our father. Similarly, we feel very sweet when we call God &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; This sweetness is the Holy Spirit witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God.</p>
<p>The outward proof of our salvation is the Word of God, the Bible. According to the Bible, we have eternal life and are saved. We know this because the Bible says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). It also says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13), and &ldquo;With the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation&rdquo; (v. 10). These words from the Bible prove that we are saved. This is the outward proof. However, we also have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit. No matter how weak we are, even if we feel miserable and shameful and are embarrassed to pray because we have fallen and committed sin, there is still a feeling in us that desires to call, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; This proves that we are saved.</p>
<p>We have covered two proofs of salvation: the outward proof, the word of God&mdash;&ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God&rdquo; (1 John 5:13)&mdash;and the inward proof, the Spirit of God&mdash;&ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo; (Rom. 8:16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Proof by the Experience of Life<br />
(1 John 3:14)</h2>
<p>There is still a third proof of our salvation&mdash;the proof by our experience of the life of God. First John 3:14 says, &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers.&rdquo; This is an experience of the life of God. We know that we have passed out of death into life not only because of the Word of God outside of us and the witnessing of the Spirit of God within us but also because of our love for the brothers. When a genuinely saved person meets other Christians, he just loves them. Before we were saved, we did not have a good feeling about Christians. But now that we are saved, not only do we love the brothers and sisters in the Lord in our country, but we also love those in other countries.</p>
<p>Because of the history of the Japanese invasion and persecution of China, I could not love the Japanese before I was saved. However, after I was saved, I was invited to Changchun, Kirin Province, to work for the Lord. While I was there, I went to visit some Japanese saints. When I saw them kneel down on the tatami to pray, a love for them rose up spontaneously within my heart. This is because within every saved one there is a life that loves God and the children of God. Hence, 1 John 5:1 says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who loves Him who has begotten loves him also who has been begotten of Him.&rdquo; The experience of loving the brothers is strong proof that we have been saved.</p>
<p>In helping new believers to have the assurance of their salvation, we should present these three aspects as proof. The verse to use for the outward proof is 1 John 5:13. The verses to use for the inward proof are Romans 8:15-16. The verse to use for the proof by the experience of life is 1 John 3:14. We can also add 1 John 5:1. By speaking these three points, we will &ldquo;tie a knot&rdquo; on a newly saved one. Thus, it will not be easy for him to waver.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after a few days he may ask why he has doubts. We should assure him that a person who is not saved never has doubts concerning his salvation; the presence of doubts proves that he is concerned about his salvation. We should then encourage him to call on the name of the Lord in order to experience more of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Most of the time a new believer will ask why he still sins and loses his temper after his salvation. We should ask him whether he feels bad after he sins and assure him that this feeling proves that he is saved. We can quote 1 John 2:1, which says, &ldquo;My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.&rdquo; In this verse the apostle John says, &ldquo;If anyone sins,&rdquo; implying that it is possible for a person to sin even after he is saved. However, the feeling of condemnation proves that he is indeed saved.</p>
<p>An unsaved person will not feel bad after he sins. Before a person is saved, he does not feel bad when he lies; rather, he might even boast of this as if it were a skill. After he swears, he might boast of swearing. Before we were saved, we always sinned. Our conscience might have felt something when we stole things, but we felt nothing with regard to lying or swearing; instead, we boasted about these. Now that we are saved, however, we feel uncomfortable when we lie or swear. Before our salvation, we took it for granted that we would lose our temper, but after we are saved, we feel sorry whenever we lose our temper. Feeling sorry is a proof of our salvation; it is a negative proof. If after a person is &ldquo;saved&rdquo; he never feels bad when he sins, it is likely that he is a &ldquo;tare,&rdquo; a false believer (Matt. 13:25). After a believer loses his temper, he will confess his sin in prayer and fellowship with the Lord. However, a nominal believer will neither feel bad nor confess his sin after losing his temper. Hence, feeling bad or sorry after sinning is another proof of a believer&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION<br />
BEING THE FOUNDATION FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH</h2>
<p>These three aspects of proof are crucial points concerning the assurance of salvation. We should use these points when we preach the gospel. We should read all the books that cover this subject, such as &ldquo;Assurance of Salvation&rdquo; (<em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 6), and chapter 15 in <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em> Furthermore, we should practice speaking these points until we are familiar with them and are able to present them. No one helped me after I was saved, and I did not understand my salvation. Hence, I often vacillated between both doubt and fear. This went on for many years. It was not until I read &ldquo;Assurance of Salvation&rdquo; by Brother Nee that I was assured of my salvation. I obtained assurance and possessed the title deed. Hence, in order to help new believers have the assurance of their salvation, we need to lead them to see their title deed in the Bible.</p>
<p>The assurance of salvation is the foundation for growth in our spiritual life. If a believer does not have the assurance of his salvation, it will be very difficult for him to make spiritual progress. Hence, after leading someone to salvation, we must first perfect him by letting him know that he is saved, and we must give him the title deed. This is the foundation. The more secure this foundation is, the better. There are three aspects of this foundation: the outward proof&mdash;God&rsquo;s word; the inward proof&mdash;God&rsquo;s Spirit; and the proof of our experience of life. These three items&mdash;God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s Spirit, and the experience of life&mdash;can be compared to a threefold cord. After a person is saved, he needs such a cord so that his salvation is secure and solid.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK</h2>
<p>We must also train ourselves in our speaking. When we converse with others, we must speak in a way that they can understand. It is not uncommon, however, for us to continue to speak even when others do not understand. Therefore, we must try our best to speak in a way that others can understand. I am from Shantung Province, and I speak with a Shantung dialect. However, by the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement and under Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading, I moved to Shanghai in 1933 and was required to give messages to the local saints. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, I made the effort to avoid using expressions that the Southerners would not understand. Although my accent was still from Shantung, I tried to avoid words or expressions that they would not understand. This continued to be my practice when I went to America. Although my English is not good, the Americans understand me. I have tried my best to learn to speak in a way that they can understand and to avoid using words or expressions that are incomprehensible. Such a practice is related to the effectiveness of our work. Without such a practice, people will have only a vague idea of what we are saying.</p>
<p>The inflection of our voice and the speed of our speaking also have an impact on the effectiveness of our speaking. This is especially true with the inflection of our voice; hence, we should practice speaking. I have stayed with many American families and have observed that their children are trained to speak from an early age. As a result, everyone can understand them when they share in the meetings. The Chinese families, however, are relatively weak in giving this kind of education to their children. As a result, the Chinese-speaking brothers and sisters often speak with accents of various dialects, making it difficult for people to understand them.</p>
<p>This fellowship is especially for those who are learning to serve the Lord, because their work is mainly to speak. In order to preach the gospel, we need to speak; in order to edify the saints, we need to speak; when we visit people, we also need to speak. What do we do when we serve full time? We speak. Hence, we must learn to speak. When I was serving with Brother Nee in Shanghai, in every meeting he paid much attention to how the brothers and sisters prayed and spoke. Whenever he heard something inappropriate, he would write a personal note to the brother or sister, telling them that what they said or prayed was inappropriate. Even his mother received such a note. He was very strict in leading the meetings. He was never loose. Therefore, all the full-timers must learn to speak properly.</p>
<p>We should neither be careless nor fearful when we speak in the meetings. We simply need to learn to speak. Learning to speak can be compared to learning a language. We should first listen, then speak, and then speak after being corrected. We should not be afraid to speak after we are corrected; instead, we should continue to speak. Moreover, when we speak, we should care for others&rsquo; ears more than our throat. This means that we should open our mouth and thrust forth our voice. We should not rush our words even if we speak fast; we should enunciate every word. These matters require training.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must also learn to put sentences together so that what we say has meaning. We must express ourselves clearly and use words that are full of meaning. We should not be pretentious and use complex words that mean nothing to the hearers. It is better to use simple words so that people can understand us. Furthermore, if we use too many quotations from the Bible, others will be puzzled and not understand the main point. All these matters require practice.</p>
<p>I hope that those who are serving full time would be willing to schedule a time to study the truth, grasping this opportunity and not wasting their time. Since we have consecrated our life to the Lord, separating ourselves from the world and placing ourselves in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, we should treasure every breath, treasure every drop of blood, and treasure every minute we have. We should seize every opportunity to learn these matters. At the same time, we should pay attention to our health. We need some amount of exercise to maintain proper health. The Lord has always had mercy on me. He cares for me and keeps me so that I have been able to work for Him until this day. May we all be like this before the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS LIFE</h1>
<p>There are several basic matters that we must know and practice in serving the Lord. These basic matters include preaching the gospel, helping new believers to have the assurance of salvation, and leading them to live the Christian life. Although it cannot be said that this is a fixed rule, we should not neglect these matters when we shepherd new believers. We must begin with preaching the gospel. After we bring forth new believers through the gospel, we should help them to know the assurance of salvation. We must use solid proofs so that they know clearly, without a doubt, that they have been saved by grace, they belong to Christ, and they are children of God. Following this, we need to lead the new believers to live the Christian life by helping them with items such as praying, reading the Bible, walking according to the spirit, and knowing the anointing. If we are well equipped in these three basic matters, we will have results when we contact people with the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING CORRECTION<br />
AND LEARNING TO BE ACCURATE</h2>
<p>Before we continue our fellowship, let me first say a word about the training. The brothers and sisters in the training must arrive on time; you must not be late. Being late to a meeting is the worst habit that a Christian can have; it indicates disrespect to the Lord and indifference toward the meeting. If the president were to come to the meeting or if he were to invite us to attend a gathering, we would never be late. Being late shows indifference toward the gathering and disrespect to the one who invited us. In the present atmosphere of so-called religious freedom, Christians have become accustomed to arriving late to meetings and leaving early without any feeling. We must realize that the Lord&rsquo;s presence is in the meetings; the Lord Himself is in our midst. Hence, we should demand of ourselves that we arrive five minutes before the scheduled meeting time. Since we have the desire to serve the Lord, we should set a good example by not arriving late to any meeting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the training there is no so-called honor or shame. Therefore, we should not be afraid of making mistakes. When we do something right, we can miss an opportunity to be adjusted. If we do something wrong, we learn by being corrected. If we do not make mistakes now, we will make a mistake later in our life, but by then it may be too late to be adjusted. However, if we are corrected now, we will receive the benefit.</p>
<p>In 1931 I wrote articles for <em>The Morning Star</em> magazine in my locality. Two years later I went to Shanghai and was placed by Brother Nee in the literature work. After a short time I was asked to be the chief editor of <em>The Christian</em> magazine when publication was resumed. I learned many things, and I also taught others. Many of the brothers and sisters who came to serve were either high school graduates or were studying in college. I needed to train them before they could copy or proofread the manuscripts. Through this kind of training I learned many lessons.</p>
<p>We must learn to be accurate in our service. A little mistake can have serious consequences. This is true in knowing the Bible, in expounding the truths, and in spiritual experiences. It is also true in shepherding people and in administrating the church. I advise the young people to be serious in their learning while they are still young and in the stage of learning.</p>
<p>We must also be accurate in listening to others. We should not only listen accurately to what they say but also correctly understand what they mean. Generally, when people listen to others, they often inaccurately hear what is spoken, and their understanding is not according to what others mean but according to their own consideration and concept. As a result, they completely misunderstand others. In our service to the Lord we must understand those whom we shepherd. Otherwise, we may think that someone does not have a problem when he has a problem, or we may think that someone has a problem when he does not have a problem. Our helping others in spiritual matters may be likened to the diagnosis of a medical doctor. If the doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis is inaccurate, his prescription will be wrong. We must learn to be accurate. In the character training that I held in 1953, I listed thirty items of the character of a serving one. The first group of character items consists of being genuine, exact (or, accurate), and strict. In order to serve the Lord, our character needs to be trained in many aspects. We should not think that the education we received included our character. The education that we received was rather shallow. In order to serve the Lord, we must be trained in our character.</p><h2 class="head1">SHEPHERDING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Concerning shepherding new believers to live the Christian life, in chapter 1 we spoke about praying, reading the Bible, meeting, preaching the gospel, fellowshipping with the Lord, consecration, walking according to the spirit, and knowing the anointing. In addition to these items we should lead the new ones to experience Christ as life, that is, to know that Christ is their life. This is to lead them to have a practical Christian life. This is the most important and central matter in our shepherding. The center of the Christian life is in the experience of Christ as life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That We Are Regenerated</h2>
<p>In order to experience Christ as life, we need to be regenerated. A person who is not regenerated cannot experience Christ, because he does not have Christ as life. When we are regenerated, the Spirit of God brings Christ into us to be our life. In other words, as soon as we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit enters into us and imparts the divine life into us. This life is the life of God, that is, Christ Himself. Hence, Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;Christ our life,&rdquo; and Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; These two verses are crucial. When we shepherd new believers, we must open the Bible and ask them to read these two verses, showing them that Christ lives in us to be our life.</p>
<p>We can even take them a step further and tell them that John 3:36 says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life.&rdquo; This eternal life is Christ. The Son in this verse is the Lord Jesus, and to believe into Him means to receive Him. When we believe into the Son, we receive the Lord into us and thereby have eternal life. Theory or philosophy cannot give us eternal life. Only the Lord Jesus in His salvation can be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That Christ as the Life-giving Spirit<br />
Is in Us to Be Our Life</h2>
<p>We must help the new believers see that Christ is not only on the throne, but He is also in us. He is the heavenly Christ on the throne of God, and He is also the pneumatic Christ in our spirit to be our life. Hence, we must point out that Christ is the Spirit. Christ resurrected from the dead, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When He died on the cross, He was the Savior, Redeemer. Now He is the life-giving Spirit so that when we believe into Him, He can enter into us to be our life.</p>
<p>We must help the new believers to see that Christ is the life-giving Spirit to be our life. Otherwise, it will be difficult to lead them to live Christ, to live in the life of Christ, and to experience Christ as life. This is the greatest shortage among Christians. Thousands of believers love the Lord but do not know that the Lord is in them as the Spirit to be their life. As a result, their love for the Lord and their pursuit of the Lord are rather religious. On the one hand, we should stress the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s being the life-giving Spirit to be our life, and on the other hand, our experience of this must increase and become richer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That We Have a Regenerated Spirit<br />
and That We Should Walk according to the Spirit</h2>
<p>When we shepherd new believers to experience Christ as life, we also need to tell them that every believer has a regenerated spirit, a spirit that has been enlivened with the life of God. We have given many messages concerning this matter, including messages in the Life-studies of the New Testament. We should read these messages. In particular, we should read the Life-study messages on Romans 8. Then we will be equipped to lead new believers to know, in a brief and concise way, their regenerated spirit. We need to tell them that man is precious because he has a spirit. Man has a body without and a spirit within, and in between is the soul. It is by the spirit that we contact the Lord Jesus, who is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. If we want to experience God and take Him as our life, we must be in our spirit and not in our mind.</p>
<p>We can explain further with an illustration. When you argue with someone, you are either in your emotion or in your mind but never in your spirit. The more you are in your mind, the easier it is for you to become angry. Eventually, anger will erupt from your emotion. Therefore, when you want to have an argument or are about to get angry, you should not act according to your mind or your emotion. Instead, you should act according to your spirit. In Romans 8:4 Paul says that we should walk according to the spirit. When we are about to become angry, we should immediately turn to our spirit. When we are in our spirit, we are not in our mind or in our emotion; we are in the Lord Jesus. Since the Lord is the life-giving Spirit, when we are in our spirit, we experience Him as our life. At such a time it is likely that the Spirit will lead us to stop arguing and to go to our room to pray.</p>
<p>The sisters should have this kind of experience when they go shopping. They must follow the Spirit and walk according to the indwelling Spirit. This is to take the Lord Jesus as their life. They should always fellowship with the Lord and pray. In particular, they should pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s word. Pray-reading the Word will help them to turn away from so many people, things, and matters that are outside the Lord and to turn to the Lord. In this way their thoughts, behavior, and chores will be done from the spirit. This is to take the Lord as their life. This is also to experience Christ as life. We need to stress this point again and again. In his Epistles Paul speaks thoroughly concerning this point. In Galatians 2:20 he says that Christ lives in us, and in verse 19 of chapter 4 he says that Christ is being formed in us. In Philippians 3:9 Paul tells us to live so that we may be found in Christ. Paul also says that Christ should be magnified in us so that we can say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (1:20-21). This is to experience Christ.</p>
<p>To experience Christ in this way is to do the will of God. We do not have to focus on doing the will of God. As long as we live Christ, we are doing the will of God. Furthermore, we will be sanctified, overcoming, spiritual, and one spirit with the Lord. Thus, we will remain in the church, participate in the church life, and live in the Body, coordinating and serving in harmony with all the saints. Experiencing Christ as life is the foundation not only of our spiritual life but also of our coordination and service in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">SEVERAL MATTERS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION</h2>
<p>When we shepherd a new believer, we need to pay attention to several matters. First, we should not act like a teacher and give lessons or admonitions. We are not his teacher; we are only a saint who has led him to salvation and who is also helping him to live the Christian life, to experience Christ, and to experience the growth in life. We must have such an attitude and spirit. We should speak with an ordinary tone and not as a professor giving a lecture.</p>
<p>Second, we should speak clearly concerning regeneration and let the new believer know that through regeneration Christ lives in him to be his life. When we speak of Christ being life, we must stress the matter of regeneration, for it is only through regeneration that Christ can come into us.</p>
<p>Third, when we quote the Bible, we should avoid being complicated. The teaching concerning the experience of Christ as life is relatively deep and mysterious. If we are complicated, the new believer will be distracted and be in his mind.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should endeavor to help him touch his spirit. This requires practice. Experiencing Christ as life is a crucial point. As a rule, we should practice daily to experience Christ and take Him as life. This requires us to continually exercise until we become skillful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KERNEL OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY&mdash;<br />
WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT TO LIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>One brother testified that when he was in the brothers&rsquo; house shepherding the high-school brothers, he exhorted them not only to study but also to be trained in their character and in their pursuit of spiritual matters. He told them to learn to be joined to the Lord in every matter and to live according to the inner sense of life by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. For instance, they should not use someone else&rsquo;s toothpaste to brush their teeth, nor should they take up too much space with their towels. Strictly speaking, however, in order for these practices to be proper, they must be the manifestation of experiencing Christ as life. When I was young, I met a group of people who were not Christians. They had a cultivation according to the Chinese ethical philosophers, and thus their conduct was very proper. After I was saved, I met some saints who loved the Lord, but their outward conduct could not match that of the ethical group. These Christians loved the Lord, but they did not walk or live according to the indwelling Spirit. If we do not walk and live according to the indwelling Spirit, all the outward teaching concerning our character becomes regulation. However, if we walk according to the Spirit and live Christ, what we live out will correspond to the teaching concerning character.</p>
<p>The cultivation of a person&rsquo;s character, at most, can develop the bright virtue, as taught by Chinese ethical philosophers. However, as saved ones, we should walk according to the Spirit and live Christ. If we truly walk according to the Spirit, the standard of our living will be higher than the standard of human morality. Human cultivation of character is merely according to dead regulations, whereas a life that is lived out according to the Spirit is the expression of Christ&rsquo;s life. Therefore, when we serve in the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; houses, we should not make outward demands, such as allotting a specific space for their towels. Rather, we should lead them in life, teaching them how to touch their spirit and to do things according to their spirit, not according to convenience. We must realize that as saved ones, we have the Lord living in us, and He is leading us in every matter.</p>
<p>In the training center used by Brother Nee in Shanghai, there was a communal bathroom with water basins. The training required that we wash and wipe the basins clean after each use. Some brothers wiped the basins hastily and carelessly. They did not keep the regulation, because they did not walk according to the Spirit. If we walk according to the Spirit, even if there is no outward regulation, the Lord would lead us to keep the basins clean. When we walk according to the Spirit, we express something of life, something living, and not dead regulation. Others may think that we have a very high standard of cultivation, but we are walking according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>When I was young, older family members often taught us not to talk too much. They would say maxims, such as &ldquo;When eating, do not talk,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The mouth is the primary source of calamities.&rdquo; However, to live Christ is not to use maxims to restrict ourselves. To live Christ is to let Christ live in us. When He speaks, we speak, and when He does not speak, we do not speak. Our living and conduct are not according to the cultivation of ethical philosophers or maxims passed down from older generations. Rather, we live Christ entirely according to the Spirit. We can have a particular living by taking Christ as life; hence, it is altogether something living. The cultivation of character taught by ethical philosophers is dead in nature; it is merely an improvement in one&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>Our practice should not be aimed at merely being correct outwardly. Rather, we should ask whether our correct behavior comes from cultivation or from Christ. If we walk according to the Spirit, there will be a situation in our living that is superior to that of the cultivation by ethical philosophers. Furthermore, our situation will be living and bright. This is most precious, and it is the kernel of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. I hope that every brother and sister in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will live this kind of life. In the small group meetings we should speak more concerning taking Christ as life. We need to have more experience and more exercise in this matter.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT AND<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>After leading new believers to experience Christ as life, we need to lead them into a deeper experience. We should lead them to experience the Holy Spirit and the cross, that is, to experience the Spirit of life and the cross. Thirty years ago we were not clear concerning the experience of the Spirit of life and the cross. Based on our study, knowledge, and experience of the truth in the Bible in the last thirty years, this matter has become clear to us. Our experience of the Spirit of life and the cross must be simultaneous; we cannot have one without the other. If we live Christ and experience Christ as life, we will see that the Christ whom we experience is the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>Before 1949 we rarely used the phrase <em>the Spirit of life</em> in our publications. At that time we saw only the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2; we did not see the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45. In resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit. The terms <em>the Spirit of life</em> and <em>the life-giving Spirit</em> are slightly different in meaning. The emphasis of <em>the Spirit of life</em> is related to the truth, whereas the emphasis of <em>the life-giving Spirit</em> is related to experience. We did not see this point until we left mainland China and came to Taiwan.</p>
<p>From the ministry of Brother Nee we see that in order to experience the death and resurrection of Christ, we must experience life. In his latter ministry Brother Nee spoke strongly on this point, saying that without the experience of life, one can never experience the cross. He said that the fact of our co-death with Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only in the Spirit of life in Romans 8. In chapter 6 we have the fact of our co-death with Christ but not the experience. Our co-death with Christ can be experienced only in the Spirit of life in chapter 8. Brother Nee&rsquo;s speaking helped me greatly. Through his speaking I was able to see further concerning the life-giving Spirit and to see that this life-giving Spirit is an all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>However, at that time Brother Nee did not say that the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death is in the Spirit of life. Neither did he say that the Spirit of life contains the element of Christ&rsquo;s death. In his ministry he did not point out that the Spirit of life is the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF GOD BEING PROCESSED<br />
TO BECOME THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>To compound is to combine several elements so as to form one substance. Before the Lord was incarnated, the Spirit of God was simple, containing only one element, divinity. When the Lord was incarnated, divinity was mingled with humanity, and humanity was mingled with divinity. Therefore, at the conception of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God had a new title&mdash;the Holy Spirit. Previously, the Spirit of God merely possessed divinity, but after incarnation the Lord brought divinity into humanity so that divinity was mingled with humanity. As the One who was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin and as the God-man who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, the Lord Jesus lived a human life for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross, passed through death, entered into resurrection, and ascended into heaven. Hence, after the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, several elements were added to the Spirit of God. These elements include the Lord&rsquo;s human living and His all-inclusive death on the cross. His death terminated all of the old creation and released the divine life.</p>
<p>The Lord entered into resurrection after His death; hence, the element of resurrection was also added to the Spirit of God. Now the Spirit of God has the elements of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; The Spirit, as spoken of in this verse, was &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; until Jesus passed through death and was glorified in resurrection. This Spirit is the life-giving Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15:45: &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; As the last Adam, Christ was incarnated, lived on earth, died, and was resurrected. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>For thirty years we have studied the Spirit. The Spirit is the compound Spirit and also the all-inclusive Spirit because the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension have been included in the Spirit. Hence, Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit can supply whatever we need.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT HAVING THE ELEMENT<br />
OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In order to experience Christ, we must know that Christ is the life-giving Spirit with many elements; He is the compound Spirit. In our experience the all-inclusive compound Spirit manifests mainly the element of the all-inclusive death, that is, the cross of Christ. This compound Spirit manifests a particular function: it kills everything that is not Christ. As we experience this all-inclusive Spirit, everything in us that is not Christ will be killed. To experience such a killing is to experience dying with Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him [Christ].&rdquo; Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; Ever since the time of the Reformation, all Christians who pursue the Lord know this truth. Martin Luther even wrote some articles concerning Galatians 2:20. However, not many Christians have been able to comprehend in their experience that the Christ who indwells the believers as their life is the Spirit of life. Mrs. Penn-Lewis said that in order to experience the death of Christ and the cross of Christ, we must first experience the inner filling of the Holy Spirit. In other words, when our spirit is filled with the essential Spirit, we experience the death of Christ. However, Mrs. Penn-Lewis did not point out why we experience the death of Christ when we have the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Not until these last thirty years did we see that within the Spirit of life there is a very important element. That element is the death of Christ. Hence, this Spirit has a killing function.</p>
<p>In a pharmacy some medications are compounds. These medications contain not just one but many ingredients. When a person takes a tablet, he receives all the ingredients with their many functions: one ingredient may kill bacteria, another may strengthen him, and still another may provide nutrients to meet the various needs of his body. This is an example of the compound Spirit. This Spirit contains many elements.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The All-inclusive Spirit<br />
in the Type of the Compound Ointment<br />
in Exodus 30</h2>
<p>The type of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 clearly shows the various aspects of the compound Spirit. The holy anointing oil is composed of one hin of olive oil mingled with four spices. This holy anointing oil is a type of the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago I learned from the publications by the Brethren that the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 is a type of the Holy Spirit. However, the Brethren did not point out that the holy anointing oil includes four spices. When these four spices are mingled with the olive oil, the oil becomes an ointment. According to this type there was only the Spirit of God, typified by the olive oil, before the tabernacle was built. It was not until the tabernacle was being built that God instructed Moses to prepare the holy anointing oil by adding four spices to one hin of olive oil, which typifies the Spirit of God, in order to make the holy anointing oil that was to anoint the tabernacle. The tabernacle denotes the Lord Jesus, who is God incarnated to tabernacle among us (John 1:14). Hence, from the incarnation of the Lord Jesus until His resurrection, the four elements&mdash;typified by the four spices&mdash;were mingled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices (Exo. 30:23-24), is a full type of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God, whom Christ became through His death and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; John 7:39; Phil. 1:19). The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows: (1) flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial (John 19:39), signifies the precious death of Christ (Rom. 6:3); (2) fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death (8:13); (3) fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:1; 1 Pet. 1:3); (4) cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Phil. 3:10); and (5) the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit (Gen. 1:2). Since the number four signifies the creatures (Ezek. 1:5), of which man is the head (Gen. 1:26), and the number one signifies the unique God (Deut. 4:35; 1 Tim. 2:5), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God&rsquo;s creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity. Thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit (cf. Lev. 2:4). The olive oil and the four spices were all prepared through a process of either pressing or cutting, signifying that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9) through Christ&rsquo;s sufferings (Matt. 26:36). Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being &ldquo;split&rdquo; by His death on the cross. Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility (25:2), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility. Since the numbers three and five are related to God&rsquo;s building (Gen. 6:15), these numbers in the compound ointment signify that in the compound Spirit there is the element for God&rsquo;s building. Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above-mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place. The ointment in Exodus 30 signifies that the Spirit of God became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Furthermore, &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; spoken of in John 7:39 is the compound Spirit. This compound Spirit is an ointment. An ointment is not only oil. This is also the anointing spoken of in 1 John 2:27. A picture is worth a thousand words. Through the picture of the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30 we are able to know the compound Spirit thoroughly.</p>
<p>In these years the Lord has led us in a complete way to know the Holy Spirit. Not only has He led us to know that the life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit; He has also led us to see the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6), the Spirit that is intensified sevenfold in function. The Lord has also shown us the essential and the economical aspects of the Spirit. We have a complete revelation concerning the Spirit of God according to the Bible. The Spirit is the resurrected Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">To Experience Christ as Life Being<br />
to Experience the Element of Christ&rsquo;s Death<br />
in the All-inclusive Spirit</h2>
<p>Bible expositors have called Christ in resurrection the &ldquo;pneumatic&rdquo; Christ. After Christ entered into resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. Hence, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Concerning the Spirit, in John 7:38-39 the Lord Jesus said that out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him would flow rivers of living water, but the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. The Spirit that was not yet in John 7:38-39 is in 2 Corinthians 3:17, where Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Christ who passed through death and entered into resurrection is the Spirit. Hence, when we experience Christ as our life, we experience the all-inclusive Spirit, and an important element in the all-inclusive Spirit is the cross.</p>
<p>How do we know that the cross is an important element in the all-inclusive Spirit? In Exodus 30 the first of the four spices is myrrh, which signifies the Lord&rsquo;s death. The first ingredient is always the primary ingredient. When we experience Christ as our life, the element of Christ&rsquo;s death in His life spontaneously has a killing effect within us. For example, when we lose our temper or argue with our wife, we are in our emotion and will, that is, in our soul. Since we know that we should live in our spirit, not in our soul, we turn to our spirit. As soon as we turn to our spirit and touch the Christ within us, this pneumatic Christ will kill our old creation and our flesh and put us on the cross, thus calming us down. This is to experience the life-giving Spirit and the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>For two thousand years those who truly love the Lord and fellowship with Him have had such experiences. Regrettably, they did not have the light that we have today in order to analyze and clearly explain this experience. This is similar to the fact that two hundred years ago no one knew what vitamins were, and even though there was no research related to vitamins, people nonetheless received vitamins from their food. In Shantung Province there was a fishing village near the sea. The people in that village had excellent vision. Later it was discovered that their excellent eyesight was the result of their regularly eating a particular fish in their diet. At that time people did not know the benefits of that fish. Not until the advancement in medicine did we learn that this fish contained a rich supply of vitamin A. Even though the people in that village did not know about vitamin A, they nevertheless received the benefit from this vitamin, and as a result, they had excellent eyesight.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Exhorting Ourselves to Be Crucified<br />
with Christ but Turning to Our Spirit</h2>
<p>Although in the past many saints who truly loved the Lord and fellowshipped with Him did not know the phrase <em>in spirit,</em> they experienced fellowshipping with the Lord in spirit. They fellowshipped with Him continually, and consequently they experienced the killing of the flesh. This is to experience the killing element in the life-giving Spirit. We do not need to repeatedly recite, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ. I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; Such recitation is ineffective. After hearing or reading a message on being crucified with Christ, a brother may try to practice this. When he is about to explode and the old man is being expressed, he may say that he is crucified with Christ. However, if his wife continues to nag at him, he will be impatient. He will no longer be able to act as if he is on the cross. Since the cross is only a word on his lips, he will eventually lose his temper.</p>
<p>Being crucified with Christ is not the result of repeatedly reciting Galatians 2:20. Being crucified with Christ is the result of turning to our spirit and experiencing Christ as our life. Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and in the Spirit is the element of Christ&rsquo;s death that will kill every negative feeling within us. When a person is sick, he does not repeatedly say that his germs must be killed. If he takes an antibiotic, it will operate in his blood stream, and the germ-killing ingredient in the antibiotic will spontaneously kill the germs in him. Similarly, we do not have to crucify ourselves with Christ. When we are in our spirit, we will spontaneously experience the death of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT<br />
AND THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must experience the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ. Many saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have a heart to pursue the Lord but may not have definite experiences of the Spirit of life and the cross of Christ. This has not become a habit in their living. Only when this is our experience can we lead others into this experience. Then it will not be so easy for us to lose our temper. Furthermore, we will be those who are truly one spirit with the Lord. In His all-inclusive death we can be one spirit with Him. When we are one spirit with Him in His death, we will also be one with Him in His resurrection and ascension.</p>
<p>When we experience the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ, our growth in life will deepen. Then we will be able to lead others into these experiences. If we are short in experience, we will not have a thorough understanding, even if we have read many spiritual books. My fellowship with you is brief but succinct. The process advancing from preaching the gospel, which leads new believers to salvation, to bringing new believers into the realm of ascension has to be accomplished by continually experiencing the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD BEING PROCESSED<br />
TO BECOME THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many years ago we saw that in order to experience Christ&rsquo;s death we need to have the experience of the Holy Spirit, but we did not see that in the New Testament the Holy Spirit has become the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;who passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>Through the process that the Triune God went through, various elements were added to the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God had only the element of divinity, but through the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, the element of humanity was added to the Spirit of God. The Lord Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and the element of human living was added to the Spirit. Humanity was added to the Spirit through the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, and human living was added through His living as a man. Furthermore, the elements of death and resurrection were also added to the Spirit. However, we dare not consider resurrection and ascension as two separate elements. Incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection are four elements. But we do not consider ascension as another element, because ascension is a matter of position. In His ascension Christ entered into a new position; hence, ascension is not a new element.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE HUMAN LIVING OF JESUS<br />
IN THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being under Brother Nee&rsquo;s Big Umbrella</h2>
<p>We have all experienced joys and sorrows in our human life. These experiences have added many elements into our being. The saying &ldquo;going through wind and frost&rdquo; means that a person experiences many hardships and sufferings; many elements have been added into him. I am eighty years of age, and my life has been full of &ldquo;wind and frost.&rdquo; Today I can say that nothing affects me. I was not born into a poor family, but when I was about ten years old, my family situation had a drastic change, and we reached the point of dire poverty. At that time I began to experience hardships and sufferings. Later, I was saved and I loved the Lord. Then at the initial stage of my serving the Lord, I was under the big umbrella of Brother Nee. He shielded me from the rain and from the storms. All the slandering fell on him, and all the rumors were aimed at him. Under that big umbrella, I was like a favored son knowing only to enjoy. Later, due to the change in the political situation in China, I was brought into another situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Moving to Taiwan</h2>
<p>In November 1948 the United States had a presidential election, and many Chinese people hoped that the candidate of the Republican Party would be elected. I was in Hangchow leading a special conference concerning the migration to Yi-yang, Kiangsi Province, when I received a cable from Brother Nee asking me to drop everything and take a train immediately to Shanghai. Therefore, I made arrangements for the last meeting and went to the train station with my luggage. At the station I saw a newspaper reporting that Harry Truman had won the election. Upon arriving in Shanghai, Brother Nee informed me that there would be an urgent co-workers&rsquo; meeting that night to deal with the situation. After a long period of silence at the beginning of the meeting, Brother Nee said, &ldquo;The situation today is very clear. We need to fellowship, pray, and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning how to deal with this situation. However, in any case we would ask Brother Lee to go abroad.&rdquo; Because we had purchased a piece of land on Nanyang Road in Shanghai and were prepared to build a big meeting hall, Brother Nee charged me to oversee the building of the meeting hall and leave Shanghai upon its completion. The following year in February Brother Nee called another urgent co-workers&rsquo; meeting. During the meeting he said, &ldquo;We still would ask Brother Lee to go abroad.&rdquo; Hence, in April I left Shanghai for Taiwan.</p>
<p>In Taiwan my family of ten lived in a room that was about two hundred eighty square feet. Every day I lay in my bed and stared at the ceiling, asking what I was doing in Taiwan. One day the Lord spoke to me. He said that I should go and visit the brothers and sisters who had come to Taiwan from mainland China. Hence, I traveled along the main north-south railway visiting the saints at every stop. Through the visiting, I picked up a burden. After returning to Taipei, I fellowshipped with a few brothers and told them that there were about three to four hundred brothers and sisters in Taiwan who had come from the mainland and that they would be the base of our work. Thus, we began the work in Taiwan. Once we began, the work advanced with overwhelming momentum. In the first year the number of people increased thirtyfold. Within five to six years there was a hundredfold increase; that is, the original four hundred grew to about forty thousand.</p><h2 class="head2">The Problem Created<br />
by the Spiritual Ministry in the West</h2>
<p>In 1954 some brothers felt that we needed to invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who was well known for his spiritual ministry in the West. I fellowshipped with the brothers that in terms of knowing a person or a matter, we never pay attention to big things; rather, it is in the small things that we see the true situation of a person. From the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we were enlightened by the Lord to drop Christmas. Hence, we do not celebrate Christmas, nor do we receive or send Christmas cards. However, this brother in the January 1955 issue of his magazine, <em>A Witness and a Testimony,</em> released an official note of appreciation to those who sent him Christmas cards. Although this was a small matter, it revealed his condition. If we invited him, I felt that there could be a problem, and that both sides would be hurt in the process. It would be safer for us to keep some distance between him and us. Brother Nee stayed with Brother Austin-Sparks for more than a year, from 1937 to 1938. Brother Nee later told me that although Brother Sparks has a portion in spiritual matters, he did not see nor would he receive any light concerning the practicality of the church. If Brother Nee was not able to convince him concerning the practicality of the church, how could we persuade him?</p>
<p>Initially, the brothers received this fellowship. However, not long afterward they brought this matter up again, saying that they needed the spiritual portion from Brother Austin-Sparks. At that time, it would have been inappropriate for me to insist on not inviting him. So I wrote an invitation letter in English and formally invited Brother Austin-Sparks to come. He came in 1955. During that visit he did not touch the matter of the church. He ministered according to his portion. We were genuinely helped, and everyone felt good.</p>
<p>In 1957 we invited Brother Austin-Sparks again. This time he stayed with us for a longer time. One day we arranged for Brother Austin-Sparks to speak particularly to the one hundred or more co-workers that we had, and I was the translator. The brother who requested the time of fellowship asked Brother Austin-Sparks what he thought about our work, since this was his second visit. Upon hearing this question, I knew that this brother had dissenting thoughts; otherwise, he would not have asked someone from a faraway place such a question.</p>
<p>Brother Austin-Sparks immediately replied, &ldquo;When I came here last time, I did have some feelings, but I decided not to say anything. This time I came prepared to speak. Please tell me, why do the brothers who are in the military service put their caps on before they leave the meeting hall?&rdquo; At that time we had many brothers who were in the military, and they came to the meeting in their uniforms. When it was announced that the meeting was over, the brothers in the military would put on their caps while leaving their seats. According to Western custom, however, a man should never put on his hat while he is inside a building; there is no exception for the military. A man can put on his hat only after he leaves the building. This is the custom in the West, whether or not one is a believer. After Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s question, a brother explained, &ldquo;According to Chinese custom, soldiers wear their caps everywhere. However, when the brothers in the military come to the meeting, according to the teaching in the Bible (1 Cor. 11:4, 7), they do not cover their heads during prayer and the giving of a message. They put on their caps only at the end of the meeting, after the announcement of the dismissal of the meeting. This is very appropriate.&rdquo; After Brother Austin-Sparks heard this, he asked, &ldquo;Do you act in accordance to your custom or in accordance to the Bible?&rdquo; Although I felt inwardly that his question was unjustified, I translated what he said. I knew that Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s argument was irrational, because he was keeping the Western custom, which dictates that a man can wear a hat only when he is outside a building, but we were keeping the teaching of the Bible.</p>
<p>Brother Austin-Sparks also brought up another issue. He said that our bread-breaking meeting was in confusion, disorderly, because one person could call a hymn and another person could speak a few words. Concerning this matter, at his invitation I went to London in 1958 and stayed with his group for four weeks and attended their meetings. Their bread-breaking meeting was taken care of only by Brother Austin-Sparks. He prayed, chose hymns, and gave the message. It was only in the last section of the meeting that there were ten minutes of free worship. The proceeding of the meeting was very proper and was conducted entirely according to his instructions. The table displayed a row of baskets, containing small pieces of bread, and also small cups. After he prayed and gave a message, he said, &ldquo;Now is the time we break the bread.&rdquo; Then seven deacons came and stood before him, he passed the breadbaskets to them, and they withdrew. The breadbaskets were passed to each row, and everyone took a piece of bread and waited. After all seven baskets were distributed, the seven deacons lined up and returned the empty baskets one by one to Brother Austin-Sparks. Brother Austin-Sparks received the baskets, took a piece of bread, and said, &ldquo;Now we will partake of this bread together.&rdquo; After partaking of the bread, they followed the same procedure for distributing and drinking of the cup. If we compare their bread-breaking meeting with our bread-breaking meeting, ours would certainly appear disorderly to Brother Austin-Sparks. During the time of our fellowship, he was very critical of our bread-breaking meeting. I did not say much at the time, but I knew inwardly that problems would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>During his visit, we held a conference and a training. Whenever there was a free evening, some guests from England, America, Denmark, and Hong Kong would come together with a dozen local brothers, and we would have some free fellowship. I had fellowshipped with the brothers in advance and said that it would be better to avoid questions concerning the church with Brother Austin-Sparks, because such questions would not be profitable to anyone. Rather, it would be better to let him carry out his spiritual ministry and render the supply of his portion to us. Then we could send him off properly and still be able to maintain fellowship. The brothers all agreed. However, one evening as we sat in silence, a brother said, &ldquo;Brother Austin-Sparks, suppose there are five groups in Taipei that meet in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Please tell us which group is right and which is not right?&rdquo; Upon hearing this question, I knew that this was a &ldquo;bomb.&rdquo; Brother Austin-Sparks said, &ldquo;None of the groups is absolutely right. All five of them are relatively right.&rdquo; Thus, a debate ensued. At the time I felt that because I was translating, I should keep a neutral position. In addition, since I was the one who wrote and invited Brother Austin-Sparks for the second visit, I should be polite to our guest. Hence, I only translated for both sides and did not speak anything of my own.</p><h2 class="head2">Contending for the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>The next time we came together, I felt that I could no longer stay neutral. Therefore, I said, &ldquo;In our fellowship during the past two days we have touched the matter of the ground of the church. Brother Austin-Sparks has said that no group is absolutely right but that all are relatively right. He said that it depends on the measure of the stature of Christ that a group has; the greater the measure of the stature of Christ, the more the group is right, and the smaller the measure of the stature of Christ, the less the group is right. Now I would like to ask a question: The children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon, and at the fulfillment of the period of seventy years, God wanted them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the holy temple that had been destroyed. Suppose at that time a prophet arose and said, &lsquo;It is right that we worship, pursue, and love God, but we do not need to return to Jerusalem. Our worship of God does not depend on a place. It is all right to worship God in Babylon. Look at Daniel. He is spiritual, but he has remained in Babylon instead of returning to Jerusalem. Therefore, you do not have to go back to Jerusalem. It is sufficient just to be spiritual.&rsquo; I would like to ask whether this prophet is genuine or false? And whether his teaching is right or wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I continued and said, &ldquo;For the past three hundred years those who have pursued spiritual growth in life have been helped by the inner-life people, such as Madame Guyon. Concerning the measure of the stature of Christ, I think that among those of us present today, hardly anyone has a measure of the stature of Christ that surpasses that of Madame Guyon. However, as far as the church is concerned, Madame Guyon was in Catholicism, which we all condemn. Madame Guyon was very spiritual and had a great measure of the stature of Christ, but can we say that it is therefore right or relatively right to remain in the Catholic Church? I believe that none of us would say this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also said, &ldquo;During these two visits by our Brother Austin-Sparks, he has highly recommended Dr. F. B. Meyer. I have read books by Dr. Meyer and received help from him. He indeed had some spiritual weight. But at the time of his death he was still in organized Christianity, which Brother Austin-Sparks condemns. Can we say that because of his substantial spiritual weight his being in organized Christianity was also relatively right?&rdquo; After I finished speaking, no one refuted my words, and we left in an unpleasant atmosphere.</p>
<p>The next morning we had another training for the co-workers and elders from the whole island. There were more than five hundred brothers gathered together. Brother Austin-Sparks gave the message, and I translated for him. In his message he said emphatically, &ldquo;You make Christ a small Christ and the church a small church in order to fit your local ground.&rdquo; I had no choice but to calmly translate what he said into Chinese. However, for the sake of subsequent training meetings, during the afternoon teatime I spoke personally with Brother Austin-Sparks and told him that although our views differed concerning the practice of the church and the ground of the church, he should be assured that we would still respect and honor him and receive his ministry. I felt there was no need to say more than this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Releasing Messages<br />
concerning the Testimony<br />
and the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>When the meetings in Taipei came to a close, Brother Austin-Sparks invited me to go with him to Hong Kong to be his interpreter. When I returned from Hong Kong, I immediately called a conference for the whole island to speak concerning the ground of the church. Those series of messages were later published in a book entitled <em>The Testimony and the Ground of the Church</em>. After the messages were released, the majority of the brothers and sisters became clear and began to stress the ground of the church. However, several brothers who had been influenced by Brother Austin-Sparks had secret fellowship among themselves and waited to see whether I would reject Brother Austin-Sparks so that they could also reject me. At the time I was unaware of this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Invited to Visit Honor Oak and<br />
Seeing the True Situation</h2>
<p>Shortly afterward, Brother Austin-Sparks invited me to return his visit. Since several brothers were influenced by him and had become dissenting, I decided to visit Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s group to see their situation. In this way I would be able to give the co-workers an account and tell them why we could not receive his ministry concerning the church. In 1958 I went to England and stayed there for four weeks. Brother Austin-Sparks received my wife and me as honored guests during our stay in England. He committed an entire conference at Honor Oaks to me, as well as the regular meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and the meetings that were mid-week, asking me to give all the messages. Thus, I saw many situations there. Not long after I arrived there, the elders came to visit me one by one at the place of my hospitality. They told me their grievances; in particular, they were unhappy with our brother&rsquo;s control. This put me, as a guest, in an awkward situation. One day Brother Austin-Sparks invited me to visit the elders&rsquo; meeting. Even though it was a meeting for the elders, he was the only one giving directions. In this way I learned their real situation.</p><h2 class="head2">Releasing Messages concerning<br />
the Building of God</h2>
<p>I left Taipei in April and returned in October. On our return trip, I stopped in Hong Kong and held a conference there. After seeing the situation of the most spiritual place in the West, I began to consider the building up of the church. Hence, in that conference I released messages concerning the building of God for the first time. However, those messages were not complete. After I returned to Taipei, I held another conference, and I released more messages concerning the building of God. These messages were more complete. In one message I said that I went to the West with the specific intention of seeing the most spiritual place in order to see the building. Although their messages were spiritual, they did not have much building. Several of their elders had grievances, and even Brother Austin-Sparks said that he was considering moving to another place because they did not submit to his authority. After this speaking, the dissenting brothers among us began to plot about how to oppose me.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the All-inclusive Spirit<br />
in the Midst of Adversities</h2>
<p>From that time onward, the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; blazed on me, the &ldquo;rain&rdquo; pounded on me, and &ldquo;ice and sleet&rdquo; fell on me. I experienced adversities in my human life. Later the Lord led me to America, a Christian country with numerous seminaries and theologians. The light that we received from the Lord caused some believers in traditional Christianity to rise up to oppose us. They despised me as a Chinese man teaching Westerners. They published books to attack me. Taking words out of context, they alleged that I teach pantheism, because I said that Christ is our rock, our living water, our clothing, and our dwelling place. They also asserted that calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word were derived from Oriental Buddhism. They used every means possible to slander me; there are more than two hundred sixty publications opposing us, and the attacks are aimed at me.</p>
<p>Through the oppositions and attacks, I experienced adversities in my human life. However, the Lord whom I serve, my wife, and the saints who are around me can all testify that none of the adverse situations touched me. Before I went to America, the Lord used sixty years of adverse situations to prepare me. During the past twenty years, the Lord has used this ministry immensely. Three hundred fifty churches have been raised up in North America, South America, Central America, Africa, Australia, and Europe. The Lord has truly blessed His recovery. At the same time, the persecution and opposition has reached its zenith; this is the problem from the outside. We also have trouble within, that is, the rumors from dissenting ones among us. All of these constitute the adversities in my human life.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;For me this will turn out to salvation through...the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:19). By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, I can testify that I have experienced the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;the all-inclusive death of Christ and the human living of Jesus in the all-inclusive Spirit. Hence, most of what I understand of the Bible comes from my experience and not from doctrinal knowledge. How can I say that there is the element of human living in the all-inclusive Spirit? I learned it from my experience. This message is a testimony of my experience of the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ. Our Lord Jesus was incarnated, lived a human life in His humanity for thirty-three and a half years, died, resurrected, and ascended. Through this process He became the life-giving Spirit. Through His death and resurrection, the two elements of human nature&mdash;including human living&mdash;and death were added to the Spirit. Today the life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO KNOW THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>When leading a new believer to take the way of life, we should ultimately bring him to the church, because the Lord in His salvation desires to obtain the church. Although this truth has not been clearly seen and is neglected in various denominations in Christianity, the fact is that every believer is a member of the church.</p>
<p>The word <em>church</em> occurs only twice in the Gospels. The Lord Jesus spoke concerning numerous truths in the Gospels, but He spoke of the church only twice, and both instances are in the Gospel of Matthew. The first instance is in 16:18: &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo;; the second is in 18:17: &ldquo;If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church.&rdquo; If we read Matthew 16:18 and 18:17 in context, we will see that the truth concerning the church is presented in an all-inclusive and complete way.</p>

<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus took His disciples far away from Jerusalem, a place with a strong religious atmosphere, and brought them to Caesarea Philippi. Caesarea Philippi is at the foot of Mount Hermon in the northern part of the Holy Land and is very close to the border; it is almost in the land of the Gentiles. It had a clear atmosphere. Then in chapter 17 the Lord Jesus took three disciples up to the high mountain, Mount Hermon.</p>
<p>In 1977 some brothers and I visited Israel, and we drove from Jerusalem to Caesarea Philippi. We went to the foot of Mount Hermon and saw the source of the Jordan River. The source is a big fountain with water constantly gushing up. The water that gushed up not only felt cool but also caused the air to be fresh. The air in that area is cool and clean. The atmosphere there is refreshing and clear. The Lord Jesus took His disciples to Caesarea Philippi in order to ask them, &ldquo;Who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (16:15). It was there that the heavenly Father gave Peter a revelation, and he answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Breaking Away<br />
from a Religious Atmosphere<br />
to Know the Church</h2>
<p>The context of verse 18 has several important points. In order to know the church, we must leave Jerusalem. We cannot know the church in a place where the religious atmosphere is thick. Jerusalem was permeated with a very thick religious atmosphere. The Lord Jesus had to take His disciples away from the thick religious atmosphere to Caesarea Philippi, where everything was clear. This is where the disciples were able to receive revelation.</p>
<p>This is a basic principle. If we remain in a religious atmosphere, we will not be able to receive a vision of the church. We will neither see nor receive revelation. To speak about the church in a Catholic cathedral will not have any effect. Hence, in order to know the church, we must break away from the religious atmosphere.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing Who Christ Is<br />
to Know the Church</h2>
<p>In order to know the church, we also must know who Christ is and obtain a revelation concerning Christ. Regarding the Lord&rsquo;s person, He is the Son of the living God, and regarding His commission and ministry, He is the Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed One. The Greek word translated &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; means &ldquo;the anointed.&rdquo; To anoint a person is to commission him, to entrust him with a mission.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Regarding His Person, the Son of the Living God<br />
Being the Expression of God;<br />
regarding His Ministry, the Christ Being<br />
for the Accomplishing of God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; is an all-inclusive statement. <em>The Son of the living God</em> speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s person, and <em>the Christ</em> speaks of His commission, His duty, His ministry. In His person and His life, He is the Son of the living God, the expression of God. Just as a son expresses the father, the Son of the living God expresses the living God. He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3). He is also the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). This is the meaning of <em>the Son of God.</em> With regard to His ministry, His commission, He is the Christ. He came to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal plan, to fully accomplish what God had planned for His economy in eternity. Hence, <em>the Son of the living God</em> and <em>the Christ</em> mean that the One who expresses God and is the embodiment of God came to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>What does God desire to gain in His economy? Ephesians 3:9-11 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s economy is His eternal plan, His eternal dispensation, arrangement, to obtain the church.</p><h2 class="head3">The Church Coming out of Christ&rsquo;s Life and<br />
Being Built Up as His Unique Body</h2>
<p>After Peter said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,&rdquo; the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 16:17). Then the Lord continued, &ldquo;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). The word <em>and</em> at the beginning of the verse is crucial; it indicates that verse 18 is a continuation of verse 17. From this verse we know that the church comes out of Christ. As long as we lead people to salvation and to live the Christian life, we must also lead them to experience the anointing. In the anointing we experience Christ as life, and we also experience the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ. As a result of these experiences, the church is produced. Hence, the church comes out of Christ.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve are a wonderful type in the Old Testament. God did not first create a man and then create a woman. Although Genesis 1:27 says that God created male and female, according to chapter 2 He first created a man and then took a rib out of the man and built a woman (vv. 21-22). In these verses we see life, indicated by the rib, and building, indicated by the woman. The rib was something organic, and it came from Adam&rsquo;s body, out of the life of Adam. This rib was merely the raw material of life. God built this rib into a woman, Eve, who was Adam&rsquo;s other half. Adam was only one half, and Eve was the other half. When these two halves were put together, they became one flesh.</p>
<p>Adam is a type of Christ, and Eve is a type of the church. On the cross Christ &ldquo;slept,&rdquo; and from His pierced side life flowed out (John 19:34), signified by the water, to produce the church. The life that flowed out of Christ is typified by the rib in Genesis 2. However, it still needs to be built. This is life and building. Life is for producing, and building is for accomplishing. The New Testament shows two important matters concerning the church: producing and accomplishing, that is, life and building. To produce is to regenerate so that we may have life, and to accomplish is to build so that the element of Christ may be built into the saints. The result is that the church is not only produced but also completely built up.</p>
<p>The Bible is not easy to understand. The words in Matthew 16:16 and 18 are profound: &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God...Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; We need light in order to see that these simple words are comprehensive. We must be brought out of the thick religious atmosphere into a clear sky in order to receive a revelation from the Father, who is in the heavens, so that we may know the Lord. He is the Son of the living God, the expression of God, the embodiment of God. He is also the Christ, who came to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;to produce the church and to build up His unique Body as His unique counterpart. This shows that the church is of life and is building; it is also unique and universal. In God&rsquo;s creation He ordained that a husband have only one wife. This typifies Christ having only one church. In the universe Christ has only one church, one Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S SPEAKING CONCERNING<br />
THE CHURCH IN MATTHEW 18:17</h2>
<p>The second time that the Lord Jesus spoke of the church is in Matthew 18:17. The context of this verse is quite simple. If a brother sins against you, you should go and reprove him between you and him alone to gain and recover him. If he does not hear you, you should go to him again, taking one or two more brothers with you; and if he refuses to hear them, you should tell it to the church. The Lord is speaking of how to recover a brother. In this context He mentions the church. He then goes on to say that if the brother refuses to hear the church, &ldquo;Let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew 16 speaks of the universal church, which is a matter of life and building, whereas chapter 18 speaks of the local church, which is a matter of administration and management. From the context of chapter 18, we know that the church spoken of in verse 17 is involved with administration and management. This is very meaningful. The universal church is of life and building, and the local church is of administration and management. The church has these two aspects. The universal church is uniquely one, and the local church in every locality is the expression of the one universal church. The church in Taipei is an expression of the universal church; so is the church in Hong Kong. No matter in which city the church is expressed, it is an expression of the unique church.</p>
<p>We can use the moon as an illustration. Although there is only one moon, it can be seen from every city. The moon that we see in Taiwan is the same moon that is seen in America; there are not two moons. This is the same with the church; there is only one church. This church is expressed in Taipei, New York City, and Tokyo. What is expressed in every locality is the unique universal church.</p>
<p>Matthew 18 shows the local church. If there is only the universal church and no local churches, where can the saints go when there are problems between the saints and there is a need to tell the church? Hence, on the one hand, the church is universal, but on the other hand, the church is local. If you are in Taipei and you have a problem that you need to tell the church, it is easy to do so. Thank the Lord that wherever we are, there is a church. Our knowledge of the church must include both the universal and the local aspects.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING NEW ONES TO KNOW THE CRUCIAL POINTS<br />
CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>If the Lord would give me another thirty years to speak two messages a day on the church, I would not exhaust this topic, because the entire Bible is on Christ and the church. Christ is the source, and the church is the expression. Christ and the church are the great mystery. Hence, in order to lead new believers, we must learn the crucial points. We should lead them from the experience of life to knowing the church, enabling them to see that the church is a product of Christ; the church is the &ldquo;Eve&rdquo; of Christ. God caused Adam to fall asleep and took one of his ribs to build a woman, Eve. In the same principle, the Lord Jesus is our &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45). When He died on the cross, His side was opened, and water flowed out for the producing of the church. In the Epistles the Holy Spirit is building the church to be the Body of Christ (12:27; Eph. 4:12). This is the universal aspect of the church.</p>
<p>The church&rsquo;s being universal is mysterious and difficult to comprehend, yet it is easy to accept. Hence, pastors in all the denominations accept that the church is universally one. However, it would be difficult for them to accept that the church is locally one, even though it is easy to understand. Hence, today Taipei is like a &ldquo;church market&rdquo; with many &ldquo;churches.&rdquo; Not only do pastors find it difficult to accept that there is only one church in one city, but ordinary Christians also do not accept this. They think that those who promote the ground of the church are self-righteous. If we are not clear about the truth, we might waver when people accuse us of being self-righteous. Many saints have been confused by this kind of wind. When such a wind blows, we should go to &ldquo;Caesarea Philippi&rdquo; so that our vision may be renewed.</p>
<p>The revival of the church in Chefoo in 1943 occurred when the Japanese invaded northern China. The Japanese army had an internal security agency that was assigned to trouble the Chinese people. As a result of the revival, we had a large number of saints and a large amount of material offerings. This aroused the attention of the agency. After investigating us for about three months, the special agents arrested me and put me in jail for thirty days of interrogation. The official in charge of the interrogation tested me on many matters. He saw that I was indeed a &ldquo;God fan,&rdquo; who wanted nothing but God. During that time I experienced the presence of the Holy Spirit. Many miracles and strange things happened. Once they asked me why the other Christian groups in Chefoo criticized me. The Lord gave me wisdom to answer this question. I responded that the Chinese say that people of the same trade are enemies. In Chefoo there were eight other groups, and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day the number in our meeting was equal to the total number in the other eight groups. For this reason, the other groups were jealous and would not say anything good about me.</p>
<p>When we go to a place to preach the gospel, we are willing to dwell in harmony with all the other Christians. The problem is not with us; they are in division. I grew up in Chefoo and came from a Christian family. Although my family was poor, I was able to study in an institution of higher education run by Americans. In those days Chefoo was not a large city; it did not have more than two hundred thousand people. Everyone knew who were the Christians. After I was saved, I pursued the Lord. Therefore, the pastors in the denominations noticed me. Then the Lord raised up a church there, and I was the main speaker. Our number increased very quickly from eleven to more than fifty. Within a year there were more than a hundred in our meetings. This surprised the pastors from the denominations, such that they held a meeting and discussed how I had not attended a seminary but could speak better than a seminary graduate. Moreover, they said that we liked to steal their &ldquo;good&rdquo; sheep.</p>
<p>At the end of 1935 the work arranged for me to move to Tientsin to labor in the Beijing and Tientsin area; I was there for more than a year. During this period I visited Chefoo, and the elders from the denominations jointly invited me for a meal with the intention of dealing with me. During this meal the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ upheld and equipped me to answer their questions.</p>
<p>After the first course, one of the elders said that it is right for me to preach the gospel and teach the truth, but it is not right for me to draw people away from other groups to mine. Therefore, they decided to ask me to not do that anymore. The rest of the elders, who were present, all agreed. I responded that they were all my seniors, and I was grateful to have the opportunity to make this matter clear to them. They all expressed their consent.</p>
<p>I said that in 1 Corinthians 1, Paul rebuked the believers in Corinth because they said, &ldquo;I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.&rdquo; Paul asked them whether Christ is divided (vv. 12-13). We can see that in the Bible division is not acceptable. However, today there is a great number of denominations and sects, such as the Presbyterian Church, the Chinese Independent Church, the Baptist Church, and those established by the China Inland Mission. I asked whether Paul or the Bible would approve of this situation. Then I said, &ldquo;Such divisions were absolutely not allowed by Paul. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, I received mercy to love Him and to study the truth; hence, I am able to speak the truth and preach the gospel. However, where should I take the people who are saved after I preach the gospel: where should they meet? Most certainly I cannot be in a division; so I cannot go to the Baptist Church or the Presbyterian Church or the Chinese Independent Church. Where should I take the new believers who are saved through my preaching of the gospel? I cannot send them to a place where I myself would not go. Each denomination insists on separating itself; this compels me to meet with those who are saved through my preaching the gospel. You know that my group does not have a name. We are not Presbyterian nor Baptist nor Independent nor the China Inland Mission. We are merely a group of believers who love the Lord and meet together. You are my seniors, and you understand that we meet in this way because you have forced us to. If you, as representatives of the various denominations in Chefoo, can promise me that you will take down your signs, I also promise you that I will tell the believers who meet with me that we will close the door of our meeting place. I will take the lead to close the door if you will take down your denominational names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they said that they could not do this, and I responded, &ldquo;If you are not able to do this, you must bear the responsibility.&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;Sirs, you insist on keeping the name of your respective denomination or group, and you are condemning me for drawing your people away. Are these people not the Lord&rsquo;s sheep? Sheep always look for grass; wherever there is grass, they will go. Believers come to me because there is &lsquo;grass.&rsquo; Please do not blame me. If you provide a good pasture, the sheep will surely be drawn to you. This is not a matter of who is drawing the sheep but a matter of where the grass is.&rdquo; After this the elders had nothing to say.</p>
<p>This testimony is to help us see the ground of the church and to teach us how to deal with this issue. It is not easy for people to accept the church being one on the local ground. Hence, we should be like boxers when we lead new believers. Instead of speaking randomly, we should convince them with clear points of the truth. This requires us to learn.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO KNOW THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus spoke of the church twice, first referring to the universal church, the Body of Christ, and later referring to the local church, the expression of the universal church in a locality. In leading new believers to know the church, we must first use 16:18, which speaks of the universal aspect of the church. Then we can use 18:17, which speaks of the local aspect of the church for our practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS IN LEADING BELIEVERS<br />
TO KNOW THE TRUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Speak</h2>
<p>In order for us to lead new believers to know the truth, there are several matters that require our attention. We first need to be trained in the way that we speak. When speaking the truth or conversing with others, we should have a proper demeanor and attitude. Often we are like students answering a teacher&rsquo;s questions. This training is to enable us to work, to serve, to minister the word to others, and to open their understanding. Therefore, when we speak concerning the truth, we must avoid the flavor of a student answering questions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Giving a Deep Impression</h2>
<p>When we speak with others concerning spiritual matters, we must also give them a deep impression so that they can see a vision. We must lead them out of Jerusalem with its religious atmosphere to Caesarea Philippi, where the atmosphere is clear. We must impress the new believers that even though they do not know the truth, they can enter into the truth through our speaking. During the past eleven years we have had twenty-two Life-study trainings in America. After each message there is a time for sharing and also for testing. Sometimes the saints do not understand what I have said from the podium, but during the sharing everyone becomes clear. The saints who still do not understand become clear when the message is repeated during the testing. This is the way that the Lord uses the speaking of the brothers and sisters to enable everyone to see a vision.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on One Point</h2>
<p>When we speak the truth, we should not be afraid of repetition; rather, we should be afraid of digressing to different points. If we digress, the listeners will not be able to follow our point. When we speak on a certain truth, we should remember to focus only on that truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL ASPECTS<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord mentioned the church in the Gospels only twice, yet He presented both the universal aspect and the local aspect of the church in a wise way. The universal aspect of the church is seen in Matthew 16. According to this chapter, in order to see the vision of the universal church, we must have revelation. However, in order to have revelation, we must break away from the atmosphere, background, air, and flavor of religion; we must leave Jerusalem and come to Caesarea Philippi. Only when we are in Caesarea Philippi can we receive revelation to know who Christ is and what He has accomplished. Through the knowledge that we receive, we can experience Christ for the producing of the church. In verse 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&rdquo; Based on our knowledge of Christ, we can become a living stone, and the Lord will call us &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;stone&rdquo; in Greek. Moreover, the Lord will build His church on this rock, that is, the revelation we have received concerning Christ. In verse 19 the Lord spoke of the kingdom: &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The kingdom is always related to spiritual warfare, and the result of warfare is the defeat of the gates of Hades. These words are simple, but they present the universal aspect of the church, which is the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If we had only Matthew 16 without chapter 18, the truth concerning the church would be incomplete, because it would lack the local, practical aspect of the church. In chapter 18 the Lord showed the disciples how to maintain a good relationship among the brothers in the local church. This chapter deals with the expression of the church in a locality. When a problem cannot be resolved between two brothers, it must be told to the church. If the church does not have an expression in a locality, there will be no way for the brothers to be reconciled. The church being expressed in different localities is similar to the one unique moon being seen in many places on earth.</p>
<p>The relationship among the brothers is the background of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in chapter 18. Today we are in the local churches. If the relationship among the brothers is not normal, there will be problems. The relationship among the brothers must be right for a local church to have a proper expression. If the relationship among the brothers is not right, there will be problems in the expression of a local church. In summary, the expression of the universal church depends on our knowledge and experience of Christ, whereas the expression of the church locally depends on our maintaining a normal relationship with one another. If we do not have Christ as our life, we are not regenerated, and if we do not have any knowledge and experience of Christ, it will be impossible for us to grow as members and constituents of the universal church. This is the truth in chapter 16. Chapter 18 says that even if we are in the universal church and know and experience Christ, without a proper relationship between the brothers in our locality, we are like Gentiles and tax collectors.</p>
<p>In chapter 18 the Lord shows how to maintain a proper relationship with the brothers in a local church. If this relationship is not maintained, we will not be in the local church life. With respect to the divine life, we are still in the universal church, but with respect to our relationship with the brothers, we will not be in the local church. The expression of the universal church in a locality depends on our maintaining a loving and honoring relationship among the brothers and the sisters. Eighty or ninety percent of this relationship depends on our saying, &ldquo;I am wrong. Please forgive me.&rdquo; We need to confess our mistakes to one another and forgive one another. If there is no confession, there will be no forgiveness, and the local expression of the church will fall apart.</p>
<p>In the church life some amount of friction among the saints is inevitable. If as a result of this friction we become offended and do not confess our mistakes, we will not have the practical living of a local church. The local church life is maintained by confessing to one another, forgiving one another, and forbearing one another. This is the proper church life. The Lord is very wise in His words. He said that the universal church depends on our receiving revelation and experiencing Christ, and the local church depends on our maintaining a proper relationship between the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE LIFE AND NATURE<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When leading new believers to know the church, we first should let them know that Christ is the life and nature of the church. When we were regenerated, the Lord entered into us to be our life and our nature. Some believers do not understand why we say that we are the church. Whether or not we are the church depends on whether Christ is our life and nature. The church is Christ. In reference to the church as the new man, Colossians 3:11 says, &ldquo;There cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; In the new man, which is the church, there is no Jew, no Greek, no high culture, no low culture, no slave, and no free man. In the new man there is only one constituent, Christ. Christ is the constituent of all the members of the new man. He is not only in all the members; He is the members. In the new man Christ is you and Christ is me; Christ is everyone.</p>
<p>When we lead new believers, we need to bring them step by step from knowing Christ to knowing the church. As they receive revelation and gain knowledge and experiences of Christ, they will be transformed from clay into stones for the building of the church. Concerning the church, we first must speak to them about Matthew 16 so that they may know that the church is universal and that it is the Body of Christ. Then we should go to Matthew 18 and speak concerning the local church and concerning the living of the church life in every locality as the expression of the universal church. In our practice of the church life, we must maintain a proper relationship with the brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
AS HIS FULLNESS TO EXPRESS HIM</h2>
<p>We must help new believers to see that the element, constituent, nature, and essence of the church are Christ. Christ is also the life of the church. At this point we can quote Ephesians 5:23-32 concerning the church being the wife of Christ and Christ being the Husband of the church. We can also use Genesis 2:21-24 to show that Adam and Eve were of one flesh; Eve came out of Adam. Adam&rsquo;s essence was Eve&rsquo;s essence, and Adam&rsquo;s life was Eve&rsquo;s life. Eve was a part of Adam; hence, the two were one. In God&rsquo;s eyes these two persons were one. Adam is a type of Christ, and Eve is a type of the church. Just as Eve was built out of Adam&rsquo;s rib, so the church is produced by the living water of life that flowed out of the side of Christ when He was crucified (John 19:34). Just as Eve came out of Adam, so the church comes out of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The body implies fullness. Ephesians 1:23 refers to the church in verse 22, saying that it is &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; If Adam were a bachelor, he would have no fullness, for he would be like a head without a body. When God built Eve out of Adam, he obtained a fullness. Just as Eve was Adam&rsquo;s fullness, so the church is the fullness of Christ. The church comes out of Christ, and the life and nature of the church are Christ; hence, the church is Christ&rsquo;s Body. After we are saved, we become members of this Body; and all the members are one Body, which is the fullness of Christ to express Him, just as Eve was Adam&rsquo;s fullness to express Adam.</p>
<p>In summary, the life and nature of the church are Christ, the church is Christ&rsquo;s Body, the church is the fullness of Christ, and the church is the expression of Christ. This is the light that the Lord has shown us during the past thirty years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MINISTERING LIFE AND AVOIDING DEBATES</h2>
<p>After leading a person to salvation, we should not immediately speak to him concerning the church. This can be compared to giving meat to a newborn baby. We first should lead a new believer to pray, to contact the Lord, and to confess his sins to the Lord. It is too soon to lead a new believer to know the church within the first three months of his salvation.</p>
<p>If an unbeliever has questions concerning the church, we should not be quick to answer him. Rather, we should first determine whether or not he is saved. Then we should turn him from the matter of the church to salvation, leading him to be saved. It is easy for him to misunderstand us if we speak to him about the church before he is saved. He may think that we are condemning everyone except ourselves. As a result, he will be unreceptive to our speaking and may even become negative. Hence, we should not speak concerning the church; instead, we should minister to him regarding salvation. If the Lord touches him, later it will be easy for him to receive what we say about other matters, such as the church.</p>
<p>When we speak about the church, we should never debate doctrine. We are not arguing who is right or who is wrong; neither are we boasting about our &ldquo;merchandise.&rdquo; We should always supply others with life. If we can always give others spiritual help, they will be impressed with us; they will also be grateful to us and appreciate us. Then, when we speak to them concerning the church, they will receive what we say.</p>
<p>We all have the flesh; hence, we should avoid debates. Whether we are preaching the gospel, leading new believers in the experiences of life, or speaking concerning the church, we should try our best to avoid debates. Once the person we are speaking with harbors a negative feeling toward us, it will be difficult to continue the conversation. No one likes to be wrong, and debates close the door to future conversations. We must not give new believers the impression that we are condemning others&rsquo; faults or criticizing their shortcomings. We desire to lead them in life. In order to give people the gospel and the light of the truth and to help them abide in the Lord and grow in life, we should learn to always avoid debates. We should speak only as much as others can receive so that they will receive the supply and be left with a good impression. Then it will be possible to have further contact and to preach the truth to them.</p>
<p>We should never tear down the work done by the Protestant denominations or any other group. In 1937 I was assigned by the work to labor in northern China. The brothers told me that I had a good knowledge of the truth, and that this truth, which is the light that the Lord has given to us, is not only for us but also for the brothers and sisters in the denominations. I traveled from Shantung to Hopeh, Suiyuan, Shansi, Shensi, and Honan and discovered that the Catholic Church had done much work. Although there were many mistakes and the work was leavened, the gospel had been preached to people. People had been taught to know the God who created heaven and earth. They had been told that Jesus is the Son of God; He is the true God. They also had been told that Jesus Christ is the Savior of mankind. Hence, while laboring in these provinces, I never denied this work.</p>
<p>We need to be fair and not annul the work that others have done. In this way the people whom we contact will receive what we minister; they will be able to receive further help from us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO KNOW THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT THE CHURCH IS TO GOD AND TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>In relation to God, the church is first the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15) and then the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). In relation to Christ, the church is first the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22b-23) and then the bride of Christ (5:24-25). The church as the Body of Christ is for His expression, and the church as the bride of Christ is for His satisfaction. These two items concerning what the church is to Christ are typified in Eve. On the one hand, Eve was built from Adam&rsquo;s rib and became one flesh with him. On the other hand, she was Adam&rsquo;s wife. In Ephesians 2, 4, and 6, we see that the church is also the new man and the warrior, both of which are for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose. The church as the new man is for living out God&rsquo;s purpose. The church as the warrior is for defeating God&rsquo;s enemy and bringing in His kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE ASPECTS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD&mdash;<br />
LIFE, LIVING, AND EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>A house is a dwelling place. A house can also refer to a household or a family and speaks of a life relationship. The Greek word translated &ldquo;house&rdquo; denotes not only a dwelling place but also a family. Hence, when we use the word <em>house,</em> we are referring to both meanings: a household and a dwelling place.</p>
<p>The house of God is related to life, to living, and to expression and function. The first matter in any family is life. An American family has the American life, and a Chinese family has the Chinese life. Life is the source. Once there is life, there will be a living, and a living produces an expression, which is also a function. The church is the house of God. Every person in this house is born of God and is a child of God. Only when we have the life of God can we be the house of God.</p>
<p>The house of God is related to living. God lives in us, and we live out the living God. The living of the church should be the living out of the living God. The house of God is related to expression. Once we live out the living God, we will have an expression, a function. Such an expression is the truth, the reality. The central truth in the Bible is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim 3:16). This is the church as the pillar and base of the truth (v. 15). The church is born of God, and the church lives out God. Therefore, the church is the pillar and base of the truth, the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth. The truth is not centered on baptism or love but on the great mystery of godliness&mdash;God manifested in the flesh. In other words, the central truth in the Bible is God being joined with man in order to dispense Himself into His people so that they, as His children, may become His house to express Him as the great mystery. This means that God entering into man and being lived out from within man is the great mystery of godliness. The church as the pillar and base of the truth holds the truth concerning God manifested in the flesh. The church does not teach concerning morality and ethics or religious rituals or ceremonies, such as baptism and bread-breaking. As the house of God, the church lives out and upholds the truth concerning God being manifested in the flesh, God being mingled with and dispensing Himself into men so that they may become His dwelling place and His household in order to live Him out and express Him. When speaking concerning the church being God&rsquo;s house, we must point out these three items: life, living, and expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE BEING THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>The church is God&rsquo;s kingdom. In Matthew 16 the Lord first spoke of the church and then of the kingdom, showing that the church is God&rsquo;s kingdom. The church and God&rsquo;s kingdom are not two separate things; they are two aspects of one thing. The church is on the aspect of life, and the kingdom of God is on the aspect of living. Chapter 16 shows that the church is a matter of life, and then it shows that the kingdom is a matter of living. When we speak of living, the church is the kingdom.</p>
<p>Romans 14:17 proves that the church is the kingdom. Chapter 14 is on the church life. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse is related to our living and shows that the kingdom of God is the church life. The relationship between the kingdom of God and the church is a matter of life and a matter of living. When the church is not merely in the realm of life but also of living, it is the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is the church life, which is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. We must lead new believers to see that the church life is the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM OF GOD<br />
BEING THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we must help new believers to see that the kingdom of God is the enlargement of the life of God. In Mark 4:26-29 the kingdom of God is a seed that is sown and grows. The seed is Christ who is sown into us. Then He grows in us and is enlarged in us. The enlarged Christ is the kingdom of God. This enlarged Christ becomes the sphere, the realm, of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In 1972 I released a series of messages concerning the kingdom of God in a conference in Los Angeles. These messages were later published in a book entitled <em>The Kingdom.</em> Afterward, I released the <em>Life-study of Mark</em> and again stressed the kingdom of God. We should read these messages when we speak concerning the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is Christ as a seed sown into God&rsquo;s chosen people to grow and expand within them into a sphere, a realm. Christ is the content of this realm. This enlarged Christ is the kingdom of God. When the Lord Jesus is sown into us, He is life. When He grows and expands in us, He is a realm, which is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>There are other verses in the New Testament concerning the kingdom. For example, in Acts 14:22 Paul says that in order to enter into the kingdom of God we must go through many tribulations. In Revelation 1:9 John says, &ldquo;I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the elderly John lived in the kingdom of God. He was not only in the house of God but also in the kingdom of God. Finally, Ephesians 2:19 says, &ldquo;You are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUENT AND CONTENT<br />
OF THE NEW MAN BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>To Christ the church is the Body and the bride, and to God the church is His house and His kingdom. The Body expresses Christ, whereas the bride satisfies Christ. The house makes it possible for us to enjoy God and for God to enjoy us, whereas the kingdom is a realm established by God where Christ can be enlarged and can reign for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s purpose. In addition, Ephesians presents the church as the new man and the warrior. The new man is for the living that can fulfill God&rsquo;s will, and the warrior is for dealing with God&rsquo;s enemy and bringing in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>The church as the new man lives according to God&rsquo;s image in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s will. In Genesis 1 man was created according to God&rsquo;s image with the purpose of expressing God and representing God for the carrying out of His administration in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s will. In chapter 3 the created man became fallen and corrupted to become the old man and therefore departed from God. By chapter 11 man was divided and scattered. This was the situation of the old man when the Lord came. After His incarnation, He died, resurrected, and entered into us. As God&rsquo;s chosen ones, we are regenerated with a new life. Hence, collectively we are the new man. The old man is the fallen created man who has not been regenerated with God&rsquo;s life. The new man is the redeemed old man who has been regenerated with God&rsquo;s life. It is through the new man, who lives out God&rsquo;s image, that God&rsquo;s will can be accomplished. The life within the new man is God, and this life is Christ. Christ as the divine life is within us to be our content. As He becomes our content, there are no more distinctions or divisions among us, because on the cross Christ abolished all divisions, including the division between Jews and Gentiles (Eph. 2:14-15). Hence, there is no distinction among us in the church. This is not achieved through the teaching of the law of ordinances but through Christ, who abolished the ordinances on the cross and has entered into us to be our life. When we live in His life, all distinctions are gone.</p>
<p>Christ is the constituent and the content of the new man. Hence, the new man lives a life that is not only like God but even is God. This life is the righteousness and holiness of the reality (4:24). As we live out this righteousness and holiness, we live out God. In this way we express God on earth and accomplish His will on earth for the fulfilling of His original purpose in creating man. This is a brief summary of the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE WARRIOR</h2>
<p>The stress of the church as the warrior is on its armor. A warrior needs to put on armor. Ephesians 6:10-18 speaks of the whole armor of God, and verses 14 through 18 show the various aspects of the whole armor of God: &ldquo;Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace; besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith...And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.&rdquo; In this portion of the Scripture there are six items of the armor of God that need to be put on, and every item is Christ. The first item is the girdle of truth. Truth is Christ, the reality (John 14:6). The second item is the breastplate of righteousness, and righteousness is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). When Satan attacks us and accuses us, we should say, &ldquo;Christ is my righteousness; His precious blood cleanses me from all my sins.&rdquo; The third item is the firm foundation of peace; this peace is also Christ. Ephesians 2:14 says, &ldquo;He Himself is our peace.&rdquo; The fourth item is the shield of faith, which is also Christ. He is the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2). The fifth item is the helmet of salvation, and salvation is Christ (Luke 2:30). God&rsquo;s salvation covers our mind against the negative thoughts that the evil one injects into us. Salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily lives (John 16:33). The sixth item is the sword of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word of God. Both the Spirit and the word are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13). The church as the warrior needs the whole armor of God, and the element and essence of the various items of the armor are Christ as our everything. To put on the armor is to put on Christ, that is, to apply what Christ is in our living. In Ephesians 6:18 there is an additional point&mdash;prayer. Prayer is the means through which we apply the various items of the armor. If we want to put on Christ as our armor, we need to pray.</p>
<p>In leading new believers to know the church, we need to help them see that the church is the Body of Christ and His bride, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the new man, and the warrior.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRESENTING THE TRUTH<br />
CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE<br />
CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw the vision of the church and the nature of the church. In this chapter we will consider how to carry out the vision that we have seen. We will consider the way to maintain a good testimony and a proper attitude among believers in human society. If we desire to work for the Lord and be used by Him, we must have a thorough knowledge regarding the church so that we bear a proper testimony. We must also speak the truth to others. Our problem in the past was that we had a general impression concerning the church, without knowing how to give a clear presentation of this truth. Hence, some saints misrepresented this truth, and others became confused.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY BEING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Our first responsibility is to preach the gospel so that those who are not saved may know the gospel, know the Savior, have eternal life, and know salvation. The starting point of our gospel preaching is not to solve people&rsquo;s problems but to reconcile them to God so that their sins may be forgiven by the Lord and so that they may receive a new life.</p>
<p>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth. Hence, obtaining eternal life is only the starting point for a new believer to live the Christian life. Obtaining eternal life is not the final goal of the gospel. After a person is saved, we have to lead him step by step to know the truth. One very important item of truth in the Bible is concerning the church. This is a rather complicated item of the truth and can be compared to a tangled ball of yarn.</p>
<p>The situation in Christianity is chaotic, but our standing and attitude are that what we hold and practice is altogether according to the truths revealed in the Bible. We do not walk according to the outward situation, nor do we walk according to man&rsquo;s need. According to what has been entrusted to us by the Lord, we insist on following absolutely the truths revealed in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRINGING BELIEVERS BACK<br />
TO THE WORD OF GOD AND TO THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Recently I was with the president of a seminary who said that the people in the local churches are always distant from believers in the denominations. Even though he was half joking, because of his age I dared not answer carelessly. I responded that, based on the light that we received from the Lord, whatever we practice is according to the truth in the Bible. After this he was silenced.</p>
<p>Criticism that says that we do not cooperate with other believers is according to human sentiments and outward situations. Such criticism is not based on the truth in the Bible. As long as we can bring believers to the Word of God, they will admit that their standing is not right. Their work is according to human need; they do not bring people to the Lord&rsquo;s Word. However, we bring people to the Word of God, to the truth. Our speaking is built upon this solid foundation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH CONCERNING<br />
THE NATURE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church has many aspects. First, the life and nature of the church are out of Christ. Second, the church is Christ&rsquo;s Body, His expression. Third, the church is the bride of Christ. Our relationship with Christ is that of the bride; He is our Bridegroom. This is not only a matter of life but also of love. Fourth, the church is God&rsquo;s house. Fifth, the church is God&rsquo;s kingdom. Sixth, the church is the new man. Finally, the church is the warrior fighting for the Lord&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>When we speak with believers about the church, we must tell them that the church is not a physical building or a club for various social activities or an association of people from the same region. The church is the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the new man, and the warrior. We must present the nature of the church so that believers have a clear understanding of the biblical revelation of the church. Once a believer has this understanding, he has to admit that Christianity is full of division and far from this standard.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SITUATION IN CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Division Being an Expression of the Flesh</h2>
<p>After more than two thousand years of history, Christianity has deviated from God&rsquo;s original intention. Christianity today is full of divisions. According to God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and His Word, the Lord has only one church, and there is only one Body of Christ, there is only one bride of Christ, there is only one house of God, there is only one kingdom of God, there is only one new man, and there is only one warrior. However, Christianity is full of divisions. At present there are more than a thousand Christian groups in Taiwan, and each group has its own practices, doctrine, and flavor. Hence, there is no oneness among them.</p>
<p>This is the practical situation in Christianity, and such a situation is not pleasing to God. Some believers say that it is better to have more denominations. They say that in God&rsquo;s creation there are many varieties and species of flowers, grasses, and trees; hence, the church should also have many varieties. If you are a person who does not know the truth, when you hear this kind of speaking, you may think that it makes sense. As a result, some believers even ask why there should be only one kind of church. This kind of speaking is an attempt to explain the confusing situation in Christianity. However, division is strongly condemned in God&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The first chapter of 1 Corinthians says that there were four groups of people in the church in Corinth. One group said that they were of Paul, another group said that they were of Cephas, still another group said that they were of Apollos, and the last group said that they were of Christ. Each group had its own excuse, but God did not justify any group. On the contrary, God condemned them for being fleshly (vv. 12-13; 3:3-4).</p>
<p>Division is an expression of the flesh. Especially after Pentecostalism was raised up in the twentieth century, Christianity has been dividing into more sects. As long as a person has a so-called &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; he is free to set up a so-called church. This situation can be seen everywhere. However, we must know the truth to see that this situation is absolutely not according to God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. Christ does not have two Bodies. Hence, we should not have any division.</p><h2 class="head2">Division Issuing In Confusion</h2>
<p>Division issues in confusion, and confusion changes the nature of the church. Bible expositors agree that the woman in Matthew 13 signifies the Catholic Church. Since the second or third century, the Catholic Church has been an organization outside of God&rsquo;s economy. She has changed the church from an organism into an organization, and she has brought mixture into the church. Chapter 13 says that this woman took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened (v. 33). In the Bible leaven signifies evil things and evil doctrines. The leaven, mixture, in the Catholic Church, such as the worship of saints and relics, was taken from pagan practices. The Protestant denominations have not been delivered from this leaven. The confusion in Christianity is filled with superstition and different teachings.</p>
<p>Christianity is full of division; starting a so-called church is as simple as opening a restaurant. This is division. We do not condone such a situation. Furthermore, as a result of the division, there is much confusion. Division and confusion make it impossible for the Lord&rsquo;s desire to be satisfied; thus, there is a need for recovery.</p>
<p>Even the so-called ecumenical movement merely produces a superficial unity among Christian denominations and groups; essentially, they are still divided. Brother Nee said that this kind of unity is like shaking hands over a fence. This is not the way to resolve division; neither is it the oneness that God desires. John 17 says that God desires that we may be one as the Father and the Son are one (vv. 11, 22). God does not care for a unity that is outward, superficial, political, or of human maneuvering and arrangement. Hence, we do not acknowledge the &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; of the ecumenical movement as the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE NEEDING TO COME<br />
OUT OF DIVISION</h2>
<p>What should our practice be? The Lord has not commissioned us to build on division or to strengthen division. In the Old Testament God did not replaster a house that was plagued with leprosy. Rather, He commanded that the house be broken down (Lev. 14:44-45). In the New Testament God has no intention to improve Babylon, which represents the religious world. Instead, He calls His people to come out of her (Rev. 18:4). Hence, we must not take part in the division in Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENTRUSTED WITH THE TESTIMONY<br />
OF ONENESS IN A LOCALITY</h2>
<p>Since we were raised up by the Lord to take His way, we need to return to the proper ground, the ground of oneness. This ground is not based on a particular teaching or a particular person but on the fact of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Since the Body of Christ is one (Eph. 4:4), our standing testifies to the universe, to the unbelievers, and to the devil that we are one. The ground of oneness is the ground of the church, and it is expressed in a locality. It is what we refer to as the ground of locality. The ground of locality is based on the ground of oneness. How do we practice this oneness? Due to physical limitations of time and space, we cannot meet with all the believers on the earth at the same time in the same place. God has revealed to us from the Bible that there is only one church in one locality; hence, we should meet together with the saints in that locality.</p>
<p>This is the arrangement of God in the New Testament. It is not man&rsquo;s idea or man&rsquo;s philosophy; it is the arrangement of God from the formation of the church. Many Christians preach the gospel and lead new believers to know the Bible, to know life, and to know the truth. However, they cannot go further because they have nothing else to say. In contrast, we go to people with a commission. Our speaking of the truth must be clear and as transparent as crystal. Our attitude toward people must not be rude, and our presentation of the truth must be proper and candid; we do not hide anything. The truth is the truth, and lies are lies. Eventually, the truth speaks for itself. We stand on the ground of oneness in our locality; this ground cannot be changed. Many children of God are not standing on this ground; they may even love the Lord more than we do and be more consecrated, more absolute, and more spiritual than we are. Nevertheless, spirituality is one thing, and the ground is another thing.</p>
<p>A brother asked how we can say that we are the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and others are not, when he knows a brother in Christianity who reads the Bible, prays, is spiritual, and has the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We must understand that having the Lord&rsquo;s presence does not make us the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that where there are two or three gathered into His name, there He is in their midst. This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s presence is everywhere. The Bible says that the Father &ldquo;causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust&rdquo; (5:45). If the evil can receive sunshine and the unjust are watered by the rain, the children of God can have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Hence, having the Lord&rsquo;s presence does not mean that you are standing on the proper ground. We must see that standing on the ground of the church and being spiritual are two separate issues.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE CHURCH<br />
TO BECOME THE PROPER TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Let us consider the history of the children of Israel. God arranged for the people of Israel to be in the good land. This was promised and ordained by God. Later, the Israelites became degraded and were taken away into captivity to Babylon for seventy years. At the fullness of the times, God brought His people back to Jerusalem and charged them to rebuild His temple on this ground. This picture typifies the experience of the New Testament believers. Now let us ask a question. Which group of people was more spiritual: those who were moved by God to return to Jerusalem or those who remained in Babylon? We should not think that those who returned to Jerusalem were more spiritual than those who remained in Babylon, because at least one person who stayed in Babylon was very spiritual, and that was Daniel. Some of those who returned to Jerusalem married Gentile wives, and others violated the law of the Sabbath (Neh. 13). Hence, the group that returned was not all that proper. Whether or not they were proper, God justified them and approved them, because the Lord Jesus was born not in Babylon but in Bethlehem, that is, from among those who returned to Jerusalem. The Lord Jesus was born in the place chosen by God.</p>
<p>We must humbly confess that there are many of God&rsquo;s children who love the Lord more than we do and are more spiritual than we are. However, this does not indicate that they are standing on the proper ground. I hope that this word will help us so that we would not merely listen to the truth concerning the church but still not know how to apply it. May the Lord help us to understand this basic truth so that in our attitude and practice we will be a proper testimony. We must know the truth so that we are not deceived by the confusion in Christianity. We thank the Lord that He has separated us. May He grant us the faithfulness and the prudence to be proper vessels in His recovery. I believe that this will bring in the Lord&rsquo;s return.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE IN LIFE AND<br />
BEING ON THE GROUND OF ONENESS</h2>
<p>We have been called by the Lord to participate in His recovery; He has placed us in His recovery. It is one thing to be in the recovery and another thing to see the recovery. Although we are taking this way, it is possible that we do not have a clear understanding of the recovery. Hence, when we encounter difficulties, problems, or warfare, we may become confused and even go astray. There have been many such incidents in the past. Even some who had been in the work for a long time went astray when they ran into problems. Hence, we should not have confidence in ourselves, thinking that we have a clear vision and that there will not be any problems. We need to receive more of His enlightening concerning the church so that we are clear. This will make us useful in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Let us consider how to maintain a proper relationship with Christians who do not meet with us on the one ground. Our relationship is based on the light of the truth and the sense of life. We know that God&rsquo;s economy is for the Triune God to be dispensed into His chosen people so that they may be His corporate testimony on earth. We experience oneness with the Lord when He dispenses Himself into us. The more God dispenses Himself into us, the more we are mingled with Him and become one with Him. When this fact&mdash;God and man mingled as one&mdash;becomes our life and our experience, spontaneously our expression will be that the saints are one in Him. This oneness is His corporate testimony, and it is what God intends to achieve in His economy. God&rsquo;s economy is to mingle Himself with us so that we are absolutely one with Him and with one another. This is what is referred to in Ephesians 1:10: &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; This is a great matter.</p>
<p>For this oneness we have a testimony in life and the ground in practicality. If we are one in life, we cannot be divided on the ground. Conversely, if we are divided on the ground, we cannot have the testimony of oneness. In order to have the testimony of oneness, we must be one in life and one on the ground. This proves that the ground of oneness is not merely an outward matter; it is related to life. If we know this and see this, we will treasure the ground on which we stand, and we will not be deceived to leave the ground of oneness. At the opportune time we will bring all God&rsquo;s children to this ground of oneness so that they may participate in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The ground is a crucial matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PRESENT THE TRUTH<br />
CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since we have a heart to serve the Lord either full time or part time, we must be active and aggressive to learn the truth concerning the church. We must pursue this truth diligently. We should not only read about it and discuss it; we should also learn to present it to others. You can practice presenting it to me, and I can practice presenting it to you, until we can all present this truth logically and clearly. This will help us have a clear view concerning the ground of the church. If possible, when we contact Christians who are not on the ground, we can also speak with them. This does not mean that we should go to other groups and point out their mistakes. Our knowledge concerning the ground must be tested. Then we will be able to stand solid and firm.</p>
<p>While we are serving, we will inevitably encounter trials in our service or problems in our coordination. Sometimes we may face temptations. At such times our knowledge of the truth will cause us to stand firm on the ground and not be shaken. It is easy to talk about the ground, but when the environment changes, when we are faced with temptations, or when we encounter trials, it may not be easy to stand firm for the Lord&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>I hope that as we review these chapters, we will study them thoroughly and have a clear understanding of the truth so that we will be able to speak this truth. Even after we have such an understanding, we will still need to ask the Lord by His mercy to grant us to be faithful so that when we encounter difficult environments or trials, we will stand firm on the ground of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRESENTING THE TRUTH<br />
CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to look at the practice of the church. In the previous chapter we saw the degraded situation in Christianity. Although there are good things in Christianity, in relation to the ground of the church it has deviated from God&rsquo;s original intention. Revelation 17 says that even though there are some good things in Babylon, it is filled with unclean things (vv. 1-6). Verse 4 says that the woman has &ldquo;in her hand a golden cup full of abominations.&rdquo; Gold signifies God&rsquo;s nature. This indicates that there are good things in Babylon. However, the golden cup is full of abominations. This is a situation of mixture. We cannot say that there is nothing good in Christianity. Nevertheless, Christianity has deviated from God&rsquo;s original intention and thus has brought in division and confusion.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 3:3-4 repudiates division. In addition, Galatians 5:19-21 speaks of the works of the flesh, one of which is sects. <em>Sects</em> is listed among the negative sins; it is even listed with idolatry, sorcery, and enmities. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s Word shows that division is condemned by God. When we speak with believers concerning the church, we need to show them pertinent portions of the Word. We should speak according to the revelation in the Word of God, not according to our view.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND OF ONENESS</h2>
<p>We have been commissioned by the Lord to bear the testimony of oneness. This testimony of oneness is the most important matter in the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Ephesians 4:3 speaks of keeping the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is based on seven items found in verses 4 through 6: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father. These seven items can be formed into three groups. The first group is one Body, one Spirit, and one hope. The Spirit is the essence of the Body, and through the Spirit the Body is produced. Hence, the Body is the expression of the Spirit. Through the Spirit&rsquo;s regenerating, saturating, and filling, we have the hope of being in the likeness of Christ. The second group is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. Through one faith and one baptism, we are joined to the Lord. The third group is one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all. The oneness of the Spirit in these verses is based on the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the Originator of the Body, the Son is the Creator of the Body, and the Spirit is the Executor of the Body. This is the ground of oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DILIGENT TO ARRIVE<br />
AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.&rdquo; Even though we are in the oneness of the Spirit, we still need to arrive at the oneness of the faith in practicality. By virtue of our believing into the Lord and entering into Him, we are one. We are one with all the believers in the Lord, whether they are in Protestantism or Catholicism. However, in addition to the oneness of the Spirit, we need to be one in practicality. This is what it means to arrive at the oneness of the faith. As long as we are children of God, we have the same faith. The faith does not refer to doctrine, neither does it refer to practices. The faith is related to our salvation, and it includes the person and work of Christ. The addition of other items to the faith, such as a special view concerning head covering or a special explanation about speaking in tongues, makes it impossible for the children of God to be one. The Lord has commissioned us to drop all the other items so that we may arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING TO THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
AND STANDING ON THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Based on the ground of oneness, we have the ground of locality. The New Testament shows that the church is expressed on earth locality by locality. Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem, 13:1 speaks of the church in Antioch, and 1 Corinthians 1:2 speaks of the church in Corinth. These churches are all local. Revelation 1:11 says that what John saw would be written in a scroll and sent to &ldquo;the seven churches.&rdquo; It then lists seven localities. The letters were for the seven churches, but they were addressed to seven localities. This clearly shows that the seven localities are equivalent to the seven churches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Acts 14:23 speaks of appointing elders in &ldquo;every church,&rdquo; and Titus 1:5 speaks of appointing elders in &ldquo;every city.&rdquo; If we put these two verses together, we see that appointing elders in every city is the same as appointing elders in every church. All the above verses are basic and can be used to explain the ground of oneness and the ground of the church. We should hold on to these expressions. Even if the whole world rises up to oppose us, as long as we stand on the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we are standing on the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVING ALL THE BROTHERS</h2>
<p>Now that we are clear concerning our ground and concerning the situation in Christianity, we will consider what kind of attitude we should have toward all God&rsquo;s children. If our attitude is wrong, our testimony will also be wrong. First, we should love all God&rsquo;s children, considering them as brothers and sisters in the Lord. The Bible says that we should love the brothers; it does not say which kind of brothers we should love. The Bible does not say that we should love only the brothers who are meeting with us, the brothers in the local churches. The Bible simply tells us to love the brothers (Rom. 12:10; 1 Pet. 1:22; 1 John 3:14). We have a love for sinners; we love them and want to preach the gospel to them. We also love the brothers; we love them and desire to fellowship with them. We should have only these two kinds of love: a love for the sinners and a love for the brothers. There is not a third kind of love. As long as a person is regenerated, we should love him, regardless of whether he insists on baptism by sprinkling or baptism by immersion, or whether he insists on a vegetarian diet or a meat diet. Whether or not a person stands on the proper ground of the church depends on the truth and light he receives from the Lord. However, even if he does not stand on the proper ground, we must still love him with the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Second, we must be clear that we cannot join an organization. This is not because we are proud or exclusive, but because we are restricted by the truth that the Lord has given us. We are restricted; we are not free. As slaves of the Lord, we can do things only according to the light that He has given us. Hence, we must be clear that we fellowship with all believers, but we will not join any organization, any divisions. We must have faith in the Lord that this does not mean that we are proud or exclusive but rather that we are standing on the ground of the church. In doing anything, it is necessary to have a ground, without which it will be easy to lose the goal. Our ground is the ground of the church. Therefore, we cannot have any association or cooperate with any group that is in division. Our conscience will never allow us to ask any organization to join us in preaching the gospel. However, we are willing to pray for all sinners to be brought to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE LIGHT OF THE TRUTH<br />
AND THE NOURISHMENT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>We should speak the riches we have obtained to all God&rsquo;s children. Many riches have been released among us through the ministry of the word. These riches in life and in truth are not only for us to enjoy but also for all God&rsquo;s children to enjoy. They are the common possession of all God&rsquo;s children. We should therefore speak these possessions so that others may also inherit them. Because of their blindness, some believers cannot receive these truths and even oppose these truths. We should not blame them; instead, we should spread these truths. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery needs to spread. Hence, we should speak forth the light that we have gained in the truth and in life so that all the Lord&rsquo;s children may have the same light, the same nourishment, and the same supply. Whether or not they will take this way is up to them. We do not force anyone to take this way.</p>
<p>Some groups accuse us of going out to steal their sheep. In response to this we should say that the truths that the Lord has given to us are very rich, but we are not building up our own group; instead, we are spreading the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s truths to all believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO DISTRIBUTE THE RICHES</h2>
<p>One brother said that those in Christianity are like the prodigal son who left home and that we encourage them to continue wandering, instead of returning home, by our giving them food. He said that he would rather let them starve until they have the feeling to come home. This thought is not right. Whether or not a prodigal son returns home does not depend on our giving him food. It depends on whether God, through the Holy Spirit, has given him a heart of repentance (Luke 15:17-18). If God does not give him a heart of repentance, even if he is starving, he will not return. We must not have a narrow heart. On the contrary, we should speak what is in the Life-studies to others and read the Recovery Version of the Bible with them. If they do not understand, we should try our best to help them. There is a scarcity of the truth and of life. However, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is like Joseph&rsquo;s storehouse (Gen. 41:56-57). We should not keep the riches in the storehouse. It is our responsibility to distribute the riches.</p>
<p>Do not worry that others will not take the way of the church. We should believe that if a believer receives life and the truth, sooner or later he will seek after the church. At that time, we should present the matter of the church to him so that he can choose the way he wants to take. A believer may choose to take this way, or he can remain where he is and serve the Lord according to the light he has received. If he chooses to remain where he is, we will not condemn him.</p>
<p>These points explain the attitude we should have when we go out to preach the gospel. If we maintain such an attitude, we will bear a proper testimony among God&rsquo;s people. Whether we are speaking for the Lord or preaching the gospel, we will be full of life and the life supply, and others will realize that we uphold the truth and practice the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Rejecting Division and<br />
Practicing the Ground of Oneness</h2>
<p><em>Question: Why do we not participate in joint gospel preaching with other Christian groups on college campuses or with the denominations?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The oneness that other Christians speak of is not the genuine oneness. It is a kind of unity. We desire oneness, not unity. In their practice of unity, each group is maintained as a separate unit and unites with other groups for a particular activity. After that activity is over, the groups return to being divided. This practice is not a genuine oneness. The oneness we desire is not a &ldquo;halfway shelter.&rdquo; In order to practice the ground of oneness, we first must reject division. If we are in division, we will not be able to practice the ground of oneness. If we are united with the Presbyterians, we will be divided from the Baptists. If we are united with the Baptists, we will be divided from the Methodists. The ground of these denominations is division. We cannot take part in the ground of division.</p>
<p><em>Question: We say that the Presbyterians, the Baptists, and the Methodists are in division, but is it not true that the local churches are separate from other groups?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Presbyterians, the Baptists, and the Methodists have a dividing line; they have set boundaries. Those of us who stand on the ground of locality should not have a dividing line. On the surface, it seems that we are separating ourselves from other believers; however, it is they who have separated themselves from us. We do not have any dividing lines. We are a group of Christians who stand on the ground of locality and serve the Lord together. If you say that we are separated from other believers, it is because their dividing lines have cut us off. We do not separate ourselves from others.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we do not take part in the ground of division; on the other hand, we accept all Christians in the denominations. We are one with them because they are children of God. When we contact them, we should be as open and warm as when we see the saints who meet with us. Hence, there are two aspects to practicing the ground of oneness. First, we reject the ground of division. Second, in our practice we are one with all God&rsquo;s children in the fellowship of life. Both of these aspects are indispensable. If we participate in any ground of division, we divide ourselves from others. Hence, in order to keep the ground of oneness, we cannot participate in any divisive ground. Nevertheless, we should have fellowship with all God&rsquo;s children, and we should love all God&rsquo;s children. We must not treat a believer differently simply because he is in Catholicism or in a Protestant denomination. If we show affection only toward the saints who meet with us, we have a sectarian spirit.</p>
<p>We need to be clear concerning the principle in these two aspects. If we are not wise, we will suffer spiritual loss and cause the church to also suffer a loss. There are many Christian groups on the college campuses. The brothers and sisters in these groups are God&rsquo;s children, and they love the Lord. It is reasonable for us to have fellowship with them. However, if we are not careful, we will affect the other brothers and sisters who meet with us. We must be careful. We should let the saints know the reason for our going to fellowship with the other believers. It is easy for us to become so busy that we forget the commission that we have received from the Lord. God raised us up for His recovery, for a corporate testimony on earth. We must be wise and follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Furthermore, we need to fellowship with the saints with whom we coordinate.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Presenting the Truth and the Practice<br />
of the Church to New Believers</h2>
<p><em>Question: Should we wait until our gospel friends ask us about the church, or should we take the initiative to speak to them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should speak the truth concerning the church and the practice of the church. However, we should not have the attitude that we are recruiting them to join us. Such an improper attitude will be conveyed unconsciously in our words. However, we should not refrain from speaking this truth simply because we want to avoid the appearance of recruiting. We must present the truths item by item to new believers. There are many aspects of the truth. The truths in the New Testament include God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem. These are the truths in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Just as we should speak concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit, we should also speak concerning the church. We should not have the attitude that we use this truth to recruit people. Rather, we are presenting the truths to new believers so that they may know these truths. As we present the truth, a believer may have a positive or negative response. We should not be bothered by a negative response. The enemy is also doing a damaging work. If our gospel preaching is strong, we will gain some people. Whether or not other believers are prejudiced against us or the new ones are damaged, eventually, the truth will prevail. We should not blame anyone. We need only to bind the enemy in our prayer.</p>
<p>After we lead people to salvation and lead them to know the gospel and life, we should lead them into the church, because every believer must not only know the Lord, but even more, he should know the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. This is clearly seen in the Bible. Through the words released in this ministry, we see Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4). These two truths are what Paul refers to as the great mystery (5:32).</p>
<p>The Lord has commissioned us to preach the gospel and to lead new believers to know that the church is His heart&rsquo;s desire. Hence, if we help a believer only to know Christ, we are giving him only half of the gospel. We should also help him to know God&rsquo;s desire and God&rsquo;s way. There are many matters related to the practice of the church. Nevertheless, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s light. We must study the truth concerning the church so that we are not confused. We must also learn how to properly present the truth concerning the church with the Word so that new believers may know the church and eventually be built up in the church to fulfill God&rsquo;s desire. This is also the ultimate goal of the gospel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FOUR URGENT MATTERS CONCERNING<br />
THE LIFE-PULSE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>Based on our study of the Word, our experience in the work, and our study of church history, we can say that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the right way. However, how quickly the recovery advances and how widely it spreads depend on our cooperation with the Lord. If we cooperate, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will advance quickly and spread widely, but if we do not cooperate, the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be slow, and its advance will be restricted. Concerning the advance and spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there are four matters that require our cooperation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>First, we must practice the small groups. Wherever a church is raised up, even if there are only eight or ten saints, we should immediately practice the small groups. The practice of the small groups does not depend on the number of people. Three people can form a group, five people can form a group, or a group can be formed even with two people. There are many details related to the small groups. All the co-workers&mdash;the senior co-workers, the middle-aged co-workers, and even those who are just beginning to serve full time&mdash;should spend time to study the practice of the small groups. This is not a simple matter.</p>
<p>From church history and from more than fifty years of experience in the Lord&rsquo;s work, we can see that since the time of the apostles, few believers have realized that the small group is the basic and excelling way to build up the church. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been among us for sixty-three years, and although we have practiced the small groups in the past, we did not stress them, nor did we take the time to study them. This is our shortage, and it has delayed the Lord for more than thirty years. If it were not for this delay, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would be in a different situation.</p>
<p>We must see the importance of the small groups. If we do not know how to have a small group, we do not know how to do the Lord&rsquo;s work. Hence, there is a need for learning. In every trade and in every academic field there is the need of learning and studying. We must continually learn and study in order to make progress. Our practice of the small groups is only at the initial stage. It was only in the past three to five months that we began to have a heavy burden for the small groups. I regret that I have not led the brothers in this matter. As the younger saints begin to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s work, they will learn to serve in the small groups. The older and middle-aged co-workers will focus on helping the saints practice the small groups. This will be ninety percent of our labor. By practicing the small groups, we will double our results with half the labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIVING INTO THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Second, we must dive into the truth. The truth is our weapon; hence, we must know the truth. When we began practicing the small groups, we led the saints to drop religion, rituals, regulations, and doctrine. For this reason, small group meetings do not have religious rituals. However, the most important matter in the small group gathering is to enter into the truth. If we cannot lead the saints to dive into the truth, the small group will not be a success. Even if a small group meeting is successful, it will be empty and vain without the truth. Therefore, we must endeavor to lead the saints into the truth. In order to do this, we must have a deep and broad knowledge of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE FIRE OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Third, we must have the fire of the gospel. We all must be on fire for the gospel. Regardless of the age of the co-workers, whether they are in their seventies or in their twenties, all the co-workers must be on fire for the gospel. We must preach the gospel earnestly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRODUCING FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>Fourth, we must produce full-timers. The church in every locality should produce three kinds of full-timers. The church should produce some who will serve full time their whole life; young ones who, after graduating from college and before getting a job, will set aside three to five years to serve full time; and older saints who will serve full time after retirement. There is a need for some who will give themselves to serve full time their entire life. It would be valuable also for young saints, after graduating from college, to set aside a period of time to serve full time before they begin working. It would also be very precious for retired saints whose children are grown to give the rest of their lives to serve the Lord since they have many experiences in life. The churches must promote and encourage the saints to produce these three kinds of full-timers.</p>
<p>If we want the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to advance quickly and spread widely and to be established and rooted, we must carry out these four matters. In every place we must be diligent to practice the small groups, to dive into the truth, to preach the gospel, and to produce full-timers. May we all receive grace to focus on these four matters and pray desperately before the Lord for this.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LIVING AND CONDUCT<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A GOAL</h2>
<p>Beginning with this chapter, we will cover some important matters that serving ones should pay attention to. We first will consider the living and conduct of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones. One who serves the Lord should have a vision, which we may call a goal. Our goal can be high or basic. An example of a basic goal is to preach the gospel to save souls, that is, to bring people to the Lord Jesus for the salvation of their souls. Although this is a basic goal, it is nevertheless a goal. We should regard preaching the gospel as an important thing in our life. We should never give it up. Furthermore, our entire being should be captured by it. As those who serve the Lord, we should have a clear goal.</p>
<p>I was called by the Lord on the day that I was saved. At that time I did not understand what it means to be called. Later, I realized that I was called on that day. While I was walking home, I had a feeling within, so I lifted up my head, looked up toward heaven, and said that I no longer wanted anything that the world could offer me, not even to be an emperor; I simply wanted to preach the gospel from village to village. That was the extent of my understanding. I never thought that one day the Lord would open His New Testament economy to me. This is an extremely high goal. However, whether a matter is high or basic, it must serve as a goal.</p>
<p>As the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones, we each should have a clear goal. This goal will be the compass in our living. This is similar to setting sail in the dark night or in the fog; a person must have a compass to set the direction. A young man in his twenties should have a goal. This is not a matter of blessing or curse; it is not a matter of having a future or not having a future; neither is it a matter of comfort or suffering. We must have a goal in our life, in other words, a purpose in our life.</p>
<p>I have been serving the Lord for almost sixty years, and I have never regretted this. On the contrary, the more I serve, the more I am inwardly assured that this is the best choice. However, this was not up to me; it was the Lord&rsquo;s choice, His calling, and His leading. Every serving one should have a clear goal. Whether or not we are married, serve full time, are poor or rich, live in a small village or a big city, preach the gospel to fishermen, or preach the truth to scholars, we should have a clear goal. Marriage, occupation, blessings, or sufferings will not change us. The entire revelation in the Bible shows that for the accomplishing of His will, the Lord desires to gain a group of people who know and take His intention as their goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING TO MAKE PROGRESS</h2>
<p>A person who serves the Lord must always pursue to make progress. Those who serve the Lord are people of the highest class. They might not be doctors of philosophy or scholars, but they must continuously progress in their learning and pursuit; they must not come to a standstill. Not only should we have general knowledge; we should also understand the tendencies in human life. We do not need to become experts or to obtain an advanced degree, but we need to learn and make progress every day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning Both the Chinese and English Languages</h2>
<p>Most of our young people in Taiwan are college graduates. They need to improve their Chinese so that they are able to express their ideas orally and in writing. Those who serve the Lord should be very particular about their writing and speech. Those who are Chinese should at least be fluent and skilled in the Chinese language. I also encourage the Chinese students to diligently study English. English has become the world language. Since those who do not serve the Lord are learning English, we, as the Lord&rsquo;s workers, have a greater need to know English. If we know English, we will be able to go to any place in the world without hindrance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the World Situation</h2>
<p>In addition to learning languages, we need to know the world situation. I began paying attention to the world situation when World War I ended in 1918. At that time the magazine that helped me the most was <em>Eastern Miscellany</em> published in Shanghai by The Commercial Press. This magazine was authoritative and highly regarded internationally. Its discussions on international treaties and the various issues among the nations rendered much knowledge on international affairs. From that time onward, I have not stopped the habit of reading the newspapers. My interest, however, is limited to understanding the international situation; I am not interested in other matters.</p>
<p>I was born in Chefoo in northern China and attended an English college; hence, I know English and have common knowledge concerning international matters. In 1958 I went abroad for the first time and had no difficulties visiting many countries in Europe and America. When I ran into problems, I was able to assert my position using English. I was even invited to give messages when I was in London, England. However, many Chinese people are at a disadvantage when they go abroad because they lack language abilities and an international perspective. Do not think that it is superfluous to learn another language, especially English. Not only should we know how to speak Chinese, but we should also learn English; otherwise, we will not be able to travel in many places of the world. Even if we do not go abroad, we can use English to read reference books. Hence, I encourage you to learn English.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING GREEK FOR STUDYING THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Those who desire to serve the Lord full time, especially the brothers, should learn Greek. If asked what the qualifications of a full-time brother should be, I would say that it is best to have a college degree and be conversant in Chinese, English, and Greek. Being conversant in Greek does not mean that one speaks Greek. Rather, the emphasis is on the ability to read Greek and to consult reference books. Learning Greek is not for us to contact new believers; it is for us to study the truth. The Bible was written in two languages: Hebrew and Greek. With the exception of a few verses, the New Testament is entirely in Greek. Hence, it is important for us to learn Greek. A person who studies the truth but does not know Greek can be considered an amateur. If we desire to know the truth, we must get to the source of the truth, that is, into the Greek language.</p>
<p>I never took a Greek class; neither was I taught. However, in 1932, more than fifty years ago, I had the feeling that I needed to learn Greek. A brother purchased a Greek-English interlinear Bible for me in a bookstore in Shanghai, and I began to learn Greek. I first learned the Greek alphabet and then read Greek grammar books. Some of those books were in English and some were Chinese translations. My knowledge of Greek gradually progressed from the alphabet, to the grammar with the language structure, and eventually to the study of different reference books. Although I am not a Greek scholar, my explanation of the New Testament Greek is based on the study of past Greek scholars. The Greek commentaries of the New Testament that I regularly use are the best and the most authoritative. When I look up a word, I get into all the reference books. Many footnotes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament are the extracts of the best reference books. They are not simply my own understanding. Hence, I have the full assurance that the footnotes will withstand any test.</p>
<p>Regrettably, I did not emphasize learning languages in past trainings with the co-workers in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we should have the view to study English. English is a common language that is needed to serve the Lord and also in doing ordinary things. A good knowledge of English and Chinese will help us in the publication work. More than twenty years ago I visited cities all over America. Wherever I went, I had an English-Chinese dictionary. This was a great help to me. We must make progress, and in order to improve, we need to learn. We are not born with knowledge. There is no limit to what we can learn, but we need to learn in order to gain knowledge.</p>
<p>I do not have a Ph.D. in English, but when I speak with theologians, they marvel at the words and expressions that I use. Once while ministering near Boston, I used the word <em>coinherence</em>. A well-known American Greek scholar who was present in the meeting was surprised that I used this word that is rarely used by modern theologians. He later wrote to me and expressed his appreciation of my teaching of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY URGENTLY NEEDING<br />
THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED</h2>
<p>Hence, I advise you all to learn and make progress. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery urgently needs those who are prepared. Never think that the value of your service is not great since you are only on the island of Taiwan. Taiwan may be a small island, but it has a great prospect in the Lord&rsquo;s work. We do not know when the Lord will take us overseas. Throughout the two thousand years of church history, there has not been a group of Christians who have had the Lord&rsquo;s testimony and truth and who were able to spread to all five continents. However, this is our situation. In Asia the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has entered Burma (Myanmar) and India. Except for the Arab world, there is a church in nearly every country. There are at least two hundred twenty churches from North America through Mexico to South America. In Europe there are at least ten churches. In Africa six countries have churches. In South Africa there are at least three churches. In addition, there are also churches in Australia and New Zealand. The churches in these places have fellowship with one another.</p>
<p>In the past two thousand years there has never been a group of Christians who, having the Lord&rsquo;s testimony and His truth, spread to all five continents and had fellowship with one another. No matter which country we go to for fellowship, the saints in the local churches welcome us warmly. In addition, our literature has been translated into Russian for the spread to Russian-speaking regions in order to make contact with the people there.</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have spread throughout the world, yet they are one. In every place there is a pasture. This is true in South America, and it is also true of North Africa and South Africa. Our problem is that we do not have mature saints who are prepared to go forth for propagation. This is our urgent need. Do not think that the work in Taiwan is for Taiwan. Rather, we are learning to work here. One day we will go to other localities in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Therefore, we must not neglect the basics. Our goal may be high, but we should begin with the most basic steps. We should not be in a hurry to spread to other places; rather, we should learn here in Taiwan and seek to improve. Do not forget that the basic requirement of one who serves the Lord is to be fully equipped with the truth. Paul was able to write fourteen Epistles because he had the full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>If the Lord gives us a feeling to go to Africa, we should equip ourselves with the local language. Since English is the common language in Africa, we should be equipped with English. If the Lord wants to send us to Latin America, we must study Spanish. We should be equipped in the truth, in languages, and in general knowledge. We should also know the world situation. Then we will be able to go out and propagate. Today the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is on all five continents of the world; the pioneers are already there, cutting the way for us. All we need to do is to send people to strengthen them and help propagate. It would be good if we had two to three hundred saints who can speak Spanish and who are ready to go and propagate in Central and South America. Central and South America are open to us, but we have no one to send.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HOLDING ON TO OLD THINGS</h2>
<p>We should be humble. We know so much truth, and the church is rich in resources; however, in the past decades we have not exceeded one hundred churches in Taiwan. We must learn to make progress. Human history is a history of making progress. Those who are conservative and hold on to old ways will be eliminated. Even the newspapers in Taiwan have improved over the years. They have adopted new terminologies in different areas, including finance, economy, and science. All the business enterprises in the world are constantly improving their methods. China suffered a great loss during the last years of the Ching Dynasty because it was very conservative. Japan, on the contrary, caught up with the Western world and is now a first-class nation. We should learn lessons from the world situation and learn how to improve. If the method of our work remains the same as it was thirty years ago, we will fall behind and be eliminated. We have the complete set of Life-studies in front of us, but not many of us have entered into the riches they contain. This is regrettable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A SPIRIT OF INHERITING<br />
FROM THOSE WHO PRECEDE US AND<br />
INSPIRING THOSE WHO WILL FOLLOW US</h2>
<p>I hope that the younger generation can change this situation. Otherwise, there will be no future in the Lord&rsquo;s work. It is imperative that we change. This does not mean that the younger generation should start a revolution; rather, they need a proper spirit. They need to know how to inherit from those who have gone before us and how to inspire those who will follow us. They must inherit the strong points of previous generations and inspire those who will follow to advance. We have many strong points in the work, and we also have many weak points. Our greatest weakness and problem are that we hold on to the old things and are not willing to learn and to change. As a result, the work has come to a standstill. The younger generation needs to receive the good points and continue to develop and move forward.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I was seventy years old when I began to write the Life-studies of the New Testament. The Chinese say that it is rare for a man to live to the age of seventy, but it was at that late age that I began writing the Life-studies. Each year I spent an average of five months, limiting myself to a small room, to research reference books. After continually endeavoring for eleven years, I eventually finished this task with the assistance of two helpers. Therefore, I have the position to speak these words. Even while I am conducting this training, I use dictionaries and reference books. I am continually learning. May we all make progress. It is not too late for the older brothers and sisters to make progress. We must have the spirit and attitude to encourage the younger ones to make progress.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>A person who serves the Lord should have a clear goal for his life and should make progress and continually learn. He must never stick to old ways. He should begin learning the most basic points and proceed forward step by step. Taiwan is a large field that requires our labor, and we must experience the Lord in our labor. We hope to evangelize Taiwan in five years. This responsibility lies with the younger generation. The young ones should go to the villages to preach the gospel and study the truth. One of these days they will be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Furthermore, they should also learn to bring in new ones like schools of fish, one school after another. We look to the Lord to raise up two thousand full-timers in five years. Then the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will have a way to go on.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HEAVENLY VISION<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning something higher and deeper. According to the standard of the New Testament revelation, those who serve the Lord are persons who have seen the heavenly vision. This is true of every person who is saved by grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES<br />
HAVING SEEN THE HEAVENLY VISION</h2>
<p>The testimony that Paul gave to King Agrippa in Acts 26 shows the heavenly vision. Paul was a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of Judaism (v. 5), and being zealous for God, he did many things contrary to the name of Jesus by persecuting Christians, including Christians in foreign cities (vv. 9-11). However, as he was journeying to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests to capture those who call on the name of the Lord, a light from heaven shined around him (vv. 12-13). This was the Lord&rsquo;s personal appearing to Paul. In that appearing the Lord said He was sending Paul to the Gentiles, &ldquo;to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith&rdquo; (v. 18). Then Paul said to King Agrippa that he &ldquo;was not disobedient to the heavenly vision&rdquo; (v. 19). From Paul&rsquo;s defense to King Agrippa, we see that his life was divided into two periods. In the first period he was zealous for God according to his natural concept in Judaism. In the second period he served the living and true God according to the heavenly vision.</p>
<p>In the New Testament we cannot find another person as zealous as Saul of Tarsus was for God. In Philippians 3 Paul spoke of himself in this way, &ldquo;As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless&rdquo; (v. 6). He gave his life for Judaism, being a zealot for the traditions of his forefathers (Gal. 1:14). He was not an idle person, nor was he indifferent. However, one day he saw a heavenly vision that captured him. No one preached the gospel to him; rather, the Lord Jesus appeared to him personally from heaven and preached the gospel to him (Acts 26:14-18).</p>
<p>In his youth Paul was educated in Greek culture; he was further trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the strictest sect of Judaism. He knew the law in the Old Testament as well as the traditions of his forefathers. He also knew &ldquo;how to serve God.&rdquo; Not only so, he was a Hebrew born of Hebrews and a bona fide Pharisee (Phil. 3:5). Such a proud and outstanding person did not consider fishermen, such as Peter and John, to be persons of importance. Hence, no one was able to deal with him. This forced the Lord to appear to him in person. Throughout two thousand years of church history, this might be the only instance when the Lord, having passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, appeared in person, from heaven, to a man and preached the gospel to him. Hence, when Paul later spoke of this incident, he referred to it as &ldquo;the heavenly vision&rdquo; (Acts 26:19). At that time a great light from heaven shined around Paul, and immediately he fell to the ground. Then a voice from heaven spoke to him (vv. 14-18). That speaking became a vision. Paul not only heard the gospel, but he also saw the heavenly vision. This caused him to fall to the ground.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The God of Glory Appearing to Us</h2>
<p>In principle, we also should have Paul&rsquo;s experience. We may be engaged with a certain matter and occupied by it, but at the appointed time the Lord will come to meet us. Perhaps, as we are pursuing an education and are about to obtain a degree, the Lord will come to meet us. Or perhaps when our business fails and we despair of living, we will meet the Lord. Our meeting with the Lord is our experience on the road to Damascus. Sooner or later we need to experience being met by the Lord.</p>
<p>One of our co-workers met the Lord in a Buddhist temple. Before his salvation he opposed Christianity. One day as he passed by an old Buddhist temple, he saw a copy of the Bible on the table used for offerings. He picked up the Bible and read Psalm 1: &ldquo;Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners&rdquo; (v. 1). The more he read, the more he was touched. Then he wept, repented, and confessed his sins. He met the Lord there, and as a result, he believed into Him and was saved. Every serving one cannot deny the fact that he has met the Lord at one point on the journey of his human life.</p>
<p>Even after believing for many years, it is not uncommon to have some questions about the existence of God, because He can neither be seen nor touched. We may wonder where the Lord is. Even I have doubted at times. I have been speaking to people about the Lord for sixty years, yet there are times when I ask myself these questions. It seems that I know, but it also seems that I do not know. One thing I know for sure is that as I was traveling in my human life, the Lord met me one day. I cannot deny this. Every serving one has to see a vision at least once and allow that vision to direct his entire life. It may seem that some were confused when they chose their spouses, and others may regret their choice of occupation. However, eventually, when we take everything into account, we must admit that it is the Lord who has directed our lives.</p><h2 class="head2">Becoming a Life-dispenser</h2>
<p>Proverbs 16:9 says, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s heart devises his way, / But Jehovah directs his steps.&rdquo; I have experienced many ups and downs in my life, so I understand human life. Nevertheless, I must bow my head and worship the Lord for His ways. It may seem that we are the ones who have chosen the way we have taken in life; however, it is altogether foreordained by God.</p>
<p>We have a desire to serve the Lord, but this is not because of our zeal. It is not because we see the poor and the sick in human society and are stirred up to love and serve them. We go to people because the Lord has called us. He calls us with the heavenly vision, and He sends us to preach Him as the gospel. The Lord has not only ordained us to be His representatives. Even more, He has commissioned us to be His dispensers, and He desires that we would become vessels filled with Christ. The Lord is sending us out so that the Christ within us may be dispensed into others. Formerly, we were fallen sinners, but now God&rsquo;s mercy has uplifted us to be His children. Every saved one should be a full-timer. After the church in Jerusalem was persecuted, all the saints were scattered, except the apostles (Acts 8:1). The scattered believers went out to preach the gospel, to dispense Christ to others. Were they full-timers? We should say, &ldquo;Yes, they were all full-timers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although I have done many things in the past sixty years, I have stayed on the line of dispensing Jesus. The more I do His business, the more enjoyable He is. Someone once asked me when I will retire, and I said that I will retire when I finish the Lord&rsquo;s business. No one can finish the Lord&rsquo;s business in his lifetime. Hence, even in eternity I will still be enjoying Him. I hope the young ones will have a proper understanding of what it means to be a Christian and a full-timer. As Christians and full-timers, we must be persons who dispense the Lord Jesus into people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD DRAWING US TO FOLLOW HIM</h2>
<p>Many saints have told me that it is good to believe in Jesus but that I should not be so zealous about the Lord. Others have said that it is not a problem for me to be zealous but that I should not cause the young people to be so zealous that they waste their lives on the Lord. This is not up to me. It is the Lord Jesus who has attracted us.</p>
<p>One brother gave a testimony and said that when he was backslidden, he prayed and told the Lord that he would eventually return. Because he knew that he could not escape, he was simply asking for a temporary leave of absence. He said that in the Lord&rsquo;s eyes one day of absence is nothing, because the Lord sees a thousand years as one day. He regards our leave of absence as mere seconds. However, it is possible for us to waste our lives in a leave of absence. We must see the heavenly vision in which the Lord draws us to follow Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISPENSING THE LORD</h2>
<p>We should not be influenced by tradition or by others who say that human society needs us. Human society does not need us; it needs the Lord Jesus. The people around us need us to dispense the Lord Jesus into them. Hence, our purpose is fulfilled only when we dispense Jesus into others. We are teachers in order to dispense Jesus. We are nurses or doctors in order to dispense Jesus. We conduct business in order to dispense Jesus, and even our retirement is in order to dispense Jesus. An older sister whose children are grown should not use her time merely for her leisure. We should all be full-timers who dispense Jesus in the morning as well as in the evening. We should even be dispensing Jesus in our dreams.</p>
<p>Some believers think that a person can serve the Lord full time either for life or for a temporary period of time. However, being full time is always for life. Does a person who is getting married negotiate with his spouse to be married for only two years? Marriage is for life. Likewise, believing into the Lord Jesus is not only for life but also for eternity. Even though there may be times when we have second thoughts, God chose us and called us, and this is irrevocable. (Rom. 11:29). Hence, in whatever we do, we should not forget our calling. Our calling is not to get married or to make money but to dispense Jesus. A mother with eight children should still dispense Jesus into others. This is the heavenly vision we have received. We should be like Paul and say that we are not disobedient to the heavenly vision. Whether we are strong or weak, overcoming or failing, is secondary; only one thing is certain&mdash;we shall be dispensers of Jesus for our whole life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN WALK AND LIVING<br />
BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Christian walk and living are altogether in the spirit. Job 32:8 says, &ldquo;There is a spirit in man.&rdquo; The spirit of man is his center. We were saved in our spirit, and we gained an entrance into salvation through our spirit. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; A true worshipper of God is a person who is in spirit. Only when a person is in his spirit can he be sincere and truthful. Hence, a person is not genuine if his living and actions are not from his spirit. Even a two-year-old child is not genuine; we can see this in his scheming. I have an eight-year-old granddaughter who often plays tricks on me, an eighty-year-old man. People in society are always scheming. We give gifts to certain ones because we love them with a selfish intention. We even scheme about how to function in a meeting, and we testify with a specific intention that does not come from our spirit. Even our care for others should not be because they have a problem but because we are in our spirit. Only that which is from our spirit is genuine and real. Should we love people or hate them? The answer is that we should be in our spirit. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple&rdquo; (Luke 14:26). This means that our emotions are directed by our spirit.</p>
<p>Some ask whether it is good to be meek. Without a doubt meekness is good. However, when the Lord Jesus came out to minister, the first thing that He did was to cleanse the temple. On that day He was far from being meek. He made a whip out of cords and drove the moneychangers and those selling oxen and sheep and doves out of the temple. He also overturned the tables of the moneychangers (John 2:13-16). When John the Baptist saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, &ldquo;Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?&rdquo; (Matt. 3:7). The Lord said the same thing to the Pharisees. He said that they were offspring of vipers (12:34; 23:33). These are harsh words. Would you be willing to say such a thing? This shows that the living and conduct of a Christian is a matter of letting the heavenly vision direct our life and of being in our spirit; we must do everything in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING TO LIVE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I have been practicing following the spirit and walking according to the spirit for sixty years; however, I dare not say that I am successful. I still do many things that are not from my spirit but in my natural man, in my kindness, and in my self. Although Paul speaks many profound truths in the first sections of Romans, at the end he still tells us to live a life of the highest virtues (12:9-21). However, the key point to the Christian life is to walk by the spirit. Our human virtues should be the issue of walking by the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-25). Romans 8:4 says, &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.&rdquo; A Christian should always walk according to the spirit. We should practice until in every situation, every hour, every minute, and every second, we are in our spirit. Then when there is a need for love, our love will be in the spirit, and when there is a need for meekness, our meekness will be in the spirit. This cannot be achieved in a short time. It will take a lifetime to learn.</p>
<p>May we all practice to not be disobedient to the heavenly vision and to walk according to our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP OF A SERVING ONE<br />
WITH HUMAN COMMUNITIES</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the relationship that a serving one should have with his community. God did not make man to exist alone. Even a billionaire who lives by himself in a mansion will feel that life is meaningless without a community.</p>
<p>Those who have a heart to serve the Lord full time should know that humans are gregarious. It is impossible for us to live apart from a community. The propagation and multiplication of mankind depend on communities. There is no possibility for the human race to multiply, propagate, and develop without communities. Everything in human life, even the bad things, is developed in communities. Since humans cannot live apart from communities, sociologists study how to utilize the strong points and avoid the shortcomings of communities in order to develop a proper social arrangement.</p>
<p>Just as humans cannot live apart from a community, so Christians also cannot live apart from a &ldquo;community,&rdquo; the church. The word <em>church</em> is a translation of the Greek word <em>ekklesia,</em> which implies an assembly. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, we cannot live apart from a community as humans, and we cannot stay away from the church as Christians. Once we are in a community, relationships are developed spontaneously. In human society in general, such contact produces more evil things than good things. A believer, however, has a relationship with another &ldquo;community,&rdquo; the church. These two kinds of relationships require two different kinds of contact. A person who serves the Lord must have a proper relationship and proper contact with those both in society and in the church.</p>
<p>Every person is born into a community. He has parents, who are above him, and siblings and cousins, who are on the same level with him. When he begins school, he will have teachers, who are above him, and classmates, who are at his level and above or below him. When he begins to work, he will have relationships with his boss and colleagues. Later, when he gets married and has children, he will have many relatives. This is a description of relationships in human communities. I once told a married brother that he should not be unhappy with his in-laws. It is good enough for him to be satisfied with his wife. If he considers the situation of his in-laws, he is only looking for trouble. All young females desire to marry a husband who is not influenced by his parents and has a good education and a good job with a good income so that their life will not be entangled with problems from their in-laws. This is often only wishful thinking, because it is difficult for a person to limit the extent of his human relationships. Since God created us and saved us, we should learn to have a proper relationship and proper contact with others in society and in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BOUNDARY<br />
BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES</h2>
<p>The first relationship in a community is the relationship between males and females. This relationship exceeds that of a parent and child. God did not first create a parent and then a child. He first created a male and then a female and only through them were descendants brought forth. The relationships within a community began with the descendants of Adam and Eve, but the first relationship was that of a male and a female. This is also a very personal relationship. A parent-child relationship is not a matter of our own choice, but the male-female relationship involves a choice. We must be clear concerning this and keep a dividing line between male and female. We should not think that we cannot be influenced to make a wrong choice because we have a regenerated spirit. Our body is fallen and is still the flesh. Romans 7 says that nothing good dwells in our flesh and that sin dwells in our flesh (vv. 17-18).</p>
<p>John 1:14 says that the Lord Jesus as the Word became flesh. The flesh belongs to sin, yet the Son of God became flesh. How can this be? The proper answer is in Romans 8:3, which says, &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; This verse says that although the Lord Jesus became flesh, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh. This was typified by the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses for the sinful Israelites (Num. 21:9; John 3:14). The bronze serpent was in the form, the likeness, of a serpent, but it did not have the poison of the serpent. This bronze serpent bore God&rsquo;s judgment for the poisoned Israelites and dealt with the serpents that poisoned them. Although Christ did not have the flesh of sin, He was crucified in the flesh. Thus, through His death on the cross God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man&rsquo;s flesh. Only the Lord Jesus was without the flesh of sin. The Bible does not say that man is spirit. It says that man <em>has</em> a spirit (Job 32:8) and that man <em>is</em> flesh (Gen. 6:3). Since man is flesh, it is necessary to keep the differences between males and females. We should never abolish such differences.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:11 says, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; If we read these two verses carefully, we will discover that they do not mention males or females. However, Galatians 3:28 says, &ldquo;There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; On the one hand, in Christ there are no differences between males and females. On the other hand, although we are the new man, in the church life the differences between males and females are still present. We have a spirit, but we also have the flesh. Hence, we must keep the dividing line between males and females in our community and also in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SHAMEFASTNESS BEING GREATER PROTECTION</h2>
<p>When we share and testify in the meetings, the sisters should always remember that they are females and that whatever they do should be done with modesty, that is, shamefastness. Modesty, or shamefastness, is a female virtue (1 Tim. 2:9). The Bible says that if a woman prays or prophesies with her head uncovered, she disgraces her head (1 Cor. 11:5). This does not mean that the brothers can act immodestly. Both males and females should have a proper shamefastness. The more modest we are, the higher the standard of morality we will have and the greater will be our protection. A proper person should be very modest and be limited in the places he goes, the people he knows, and the things that he says. The basic principle of the Christian life is to walk according to the Spirit. When we walk according to the Spirit, we will have no need for anyone to teach us, but His anointing will teach us concerning all things (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>The saints who have a heart to serve full time should learn the lesson of not being careless when contacting people and being careful concerning the setting in which they contact people. In particular, the sisters should not forget that they are females when they contact people; they are not free to speak carelessly. Otherwise, their contacting people will bring them many problems. Not only will they suffer loss but they will also cause the Lord&rsquo;s name to suffer shame. In human communities as well as in the church, we must remember that there is a difference between males and females. It is wrong to speak with a person of the opposite sex when we are alone in a room. We must have a third person present there. This is not only a virtue but also a great protection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING TEMPTATIONS RELATED TO MONEY<br />
AND TO RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN<br />
MALES AND FEMALES IN OUR SERVICE</h2>
<p>The two greatest temptations in human life are related to money and to relationships between males and females. We should never think that since we have the Spirit of the Lord and we walk according to the Spirit, we will not encounter temptations related to these two dangers. These two dangers always exist and will follow us until we are taken by the Lord. Throughout the centuries countless servants of the Lord have been destroyed by these two things, even after serving faithfully for ten, twenty, or even forty years. Therefore, while you are still young, you must learn to regard these two things as poisonous snakes and wild beasts. We should never think that we could never be overcome by these temptations. Few people, if any, can overcome the temptation of money. When money is not in our hand, we do not know how great a temptation it is. Only when money comes into our possession do we realize its tempting power. The Bible calls money &ldquo;unrighteous mammon&rdquo; (Luke 16:9, 11). This shows that money is unrighteous.</p>
<p>It is impossible for a person living in this world to not have contact with society. It is also impossible for a Christian living in the church life to not have contact with the brothers and sisters. Sins come from contact; fewer contacts result in fewer sins. According to the teaching in the Bible, we must always remember our position when we contact others. Those who serve the Lord contact people all day long. Hence, we must maintain a proper relationship with those whom we contact. In this way we will have longevity of life in our service. This is the most basic lesson that a full-time serving one must learn.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR SERVICE BEING TO WORK OUT<br />
THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING STRONG IN SPIRIT, RICH IN THE WORD,<br />
AND ABLE TO SING THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>The young people with a heart to serve the Lord full time are new blood in the churches in Taiwan, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and in the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. The burden of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the island of Taiwan is to work out the small groups. In order to work out the small groups, three things are indispensable. The first thing is our spirit. We must have a strong spirit. If our spirit is not strong or is not living, we will be like a robot. The second thing is the Word. We must have the Word, and the Word must be living. In order to be rich in the Word, we can get the help from the Life-studies. The third thing is the hymns. In order to have a successful small group, we must have these three prerequisites; we must be strong in spirit, rich in the Word, and able to sing the hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVEN WAYS TO PURSUE<br />
THE LIFE-STUDIES IN THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>There are seven ways to make the words in the Life-study messages living to us. The first way is to read short portions. When we read the Life-studies in the small groups, we should not read non-stop. We must learn to read short portions. Take the following portion as an example: &ldquo;The Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father (John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb. 1:3) is life to us (John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and become the sons of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:5-6)&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Galatians,</em> p. 22). We should not read this portion without any stops. One person should read, &ldquo;The Son of God,&rdquo; and another person can continue with &ldquo;as the embodiment and expression of God the Father.&rdquo; One person should not read more than &ldquo;the Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father.&rdquo; Then we should let another person continue. We should practice reading only a phrase or a clause, and immediately another person should continue with the next phrase or clause. If we practice this, the small group will be living.</p>
<p>The second way to make the Life-study messages living is to read with repetition. This means that when we come to an important point, we should repeat it. For instance, the phrase <em>the Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father</em> has three important points: the Son of God, the embodiment, and the expression of God the Father. It is worthwhile to repeat these three points. We should repeat these points until everyone in the small group can say them with ease. Then we can conclude by repeating it once more. This is the way to read with repetition.</p>
<p>The third way is to read with emphasis. We should read the words that need to be stressed with emphasis. From the previous example, the phrases <em>the Son of God, the embodiment,</em> and <em>the expression</em> are quite particular and should be read with emphasis.</p>
<p>The fourth way is to read with vitality. This depends on the person. If we are living, our way of reading will be living. If we are rigid, our way of reading will be rigid. To read a short portion with repetition and emphasis is a matter of skill, but to read with vitality depends on our person, not our skill. In other words, to read in this way is to read spontaneously. It is not a matter of our voice being high or low but of reading with a living spirit. We should never turn a small group meeting into an exercise routine. The more living a small group is, the better. When a small group is living, it breaks away from all religious rituals and ordinances.</p>
<p>The fifth way is to read with explanation. For instance, when we read the phrase <em>the present evil age</em> (Gal. 1:4), we may add a word of explanation and say that the present evil age is the religious world. With the addition of this brief explanation, the meaning of this phrase becomes clear. This also deepens the impression in the mind of the saints. This kind of brief explanation is better than a long, extended message. Reading the Word in the small groups requires reading with explanation to open the deep portions.</p>
<p>The sixth way is to pray-read, that is, to read with a spirit of prayer. When some saints do this, they are almost shouting, not praying. There is no prayer in their reading, no spirit of prayer, or flavor of prayer. Hence, we need to re-learn how to pray-read. After someone adds the explanation, &ldquo;The present evil age is the religious world,&rdquo; a second person may pray, &ldquo;Lord, show us that the present evil age is the religious world and that religion is a world.&rdquo; Or another person may pray, &ldquo;Lord, rescue us. Rescue us out of religion.&rdquo; To read prayerfully in this way is pray-reading. Pray-reading should be short. Often when someone in the group prays, others join in and pray at the same time. We should avoid this, because it turns the meeting into a group exercise. In a small group, nothing should be excessive or too long, even though we practice everything in the small group. This can be compared to having a meal. There is much enjoyment when the food is brought to the table one dish at a time and eaten one course at a time.</p>
<p>The seventh way is to read with singing. There are many tunes in our hymnal that are classics from generations of sacred music; they have a particular style and are dignified, weighty, and elegant. The young people should learn to sing the hymns more often until they become familiar to them. This will be a great help to the small groups. When we read John 10, which is concerning leaving the fold and returning to the flock, we can use <em>Hymns,</em> #1068: &ldquo;In tenderness He sought me, / Weary and sick with sin, / And on His shoulders brought me / Into His flock again... / Oh, the love that sought me! / Oh, the blood that bought me! / Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock!&rdquo; To read and sing is to emphasize the words by singing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SING THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>I would like to say a word about the history of our hymns. Our first hymnal was <em>Hymns for the Little Flock,</em> and it was compiled by Brother Nee. It included one hundred eighty-four hymns. In 1950 he edited the hymns and published a hymnal with one thousand fifty-two hymns. This hymnal included gospel hymns that I compiled, and the second volume of the Chinese hymnal was completed in Taiwan. In 1961 I spent about two months to write eighty-five hymns because we lacked hymns concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. In 1962 I went to America to continue the ministry, and I edited and compiled hymns in English. This work was completed in 1966. From 1966 to 1967 I returned to Taiwan and, together with the brothers, rearranged the hymns in Chinese. We compiled a new hymnal with select hymns from past hymnals, new hymns, and various hymns in English that were translated into Chinese. This compiling and editing work was finished in 1968. This hymnal, with seven hundred eighty hymns, is what the churches are using. This hymnal includes all the best hymns in Christianity. When we sing these hymns, we should sing ourselves into them. Then we will realize the value of the hymns.</p>
<p>I hope that the young ones will all learn to sing the hymns well. They should also learn the Chinese language. We must be living and fresh, and we must be able to write and to compose in Chinese. Human beings are living. Furthermore, God created a spirit within us and also regenerated us. Moreover, the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit, and we and the Triune God have become one spirit. Therefore, we should not be stale or in poverty. Those with a desire to serve should be open to learn as much as they can. According to a Chinese proverb, there is no limit to our learning. Hence, we should not only know how to sing hymns but also how to write hymns. Gradually, we will learn to compose more hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SMALL GROUPS MEETING EVERYWHERE<br />
AND AT ANY TIME</h2>
<p>The practice of the small group is the crucial leading that we have received from the Lord. It is a great opportunity and a blessing for a young person to serve the Lord full time at this juncture of our history. We must not be rigid and think that a small group meeting must be held only on Saturday. If an older sister is free Monday mornings, she can invite some neighbors to her home to sing hymns. This can be considered a small group gathering. Our spirit should be living. We should work until there are small groups meeting everywhere and at any time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
SERVING ONES AND THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>As serving ones, we have a relationship with our community and a relationship with the church. Before we were saved, it was impossible for us to stay away from our community. Now that we are saved and want to serve the Lord, not only is it impossible for us to stay away from our community, but even more we cannot stay away from the church.</p>
<p>Both the community and the church are groups. The community is a group of people, but the church is God&rsquo;s flock. The daily affairs in the community and in the church are related to people. Therefore, a serving one is intimately related to people. Saints who are beginning to serve the Lord should study the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus (see <em>The Proper Aggressiveness of the Lord&rsquo;s Serving Ones,</em> ch. 1), because these three Epistles speak of the standard of a serving one and the relationships of a serving one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT SPEAKING THINGS THAT ARE CONTRARY<br />
TO GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I exhorted you...to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things...rather than God&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo; In these verses the apostle&rsquo;s charge is related to not teaching things that are different from God&rsquo;s economy in the environment of the church. To teach different things rather than God&rsquo;s economy is to teach myths, unending genealogies (v. 4), and the law (vv. 7-8). Such teachings involve vain talk and differ from the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which is centered on Christ and the church, that is, on the economy of God. According to Acts 2:41-42, three thousand new believers &ldquo;continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.&rdquo; At that time the apostles spoke God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Hence, to speak differently from the speaking of the apostles, in contradiction to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is to teach different things.</p>
<p>If we desire to serve the Lord, we must be in an environment where there is no different teaching, that is, where there is no speaking in contradiction to God&rsquo;s economy. This means that we should not teach different things. An environment where someone is speaking things that are different from God&rsquo;s economy is not healthy. In order to live a long life, we must live in an environment where the air is fresh. We should try our best not to live in a place where the air is polluted. Similarly, a Christian needs to live in a clean environment so that he can grow and have a healthy spiritual life. In 1957 and 1958 the air in the churches in Taiwan was contaminated by different teachings, and as a result, many saints were damaged.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING CONCERNING HOW TO GO OUT AND COME IN BEFORE GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2>
<p>We must always pray. In particular, the young saints should spend much time in prayer every day. Like Solomon, we should pray, &ldquo;Jehovah God,...give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people&rdquo; (2 Chron. 1:9-10). God&rsquo;s people are numerous; hence, we must always pray and ask the Lord to give us wisdom and knowledge so that we may know how to go out and come in before His people, that is, how to conduct ourselves among them.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;These things I write to you...that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:14-15). Paul also reminded Timothy how to conduct himself with elderly men and elderly women and how to contact younger women in all purity (5:1-2). In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul says that we should &ldquo;flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; To pursue spiritual virtues with those of a pure heart is also an important matter in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO<br />
WHERE WE LIVE AND HOW WE LIVE</h2>
<p>There are four matters that we need to pay particular attention to. First, we must be careful concerning how we live. With regard to single saints, the way they live greatly affects their service to the Lord. The Chinese say that &ldquo;one who stays near vermillion will be stained red, and one who stays near ink will be stained black.&rdquo; If those who live with you are &ldquo;black,&rdquo; eventually, even if you are &ldquo;white,&rdquo; you will become &ldquo;black&rdquo; because you are in close contact with them. We become the same as those whom we regularly contact. We are influenced by our environment.</p>
<p>Married saints should also be careful concerning where they live. Every aspect of modern society is contaminated; hence, we should never randomly choose a place to live. Rather, we should always pay attention to where we live and how we live. Our negligence in this matter will give rise to many problems, some of which may even affect our married life, our family life, and our service to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING A DEFINITE GOAL AND A SCHEDULE</h2>
<p>Second, we should have a definite goal in pursuing the truth. In order to serve the Lord, one needs to know the truth and also to grow in life. We should not seek to be great when we work; we need to properly allocate our time. We should budget our time and prepare a schedule of what to do in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening for each day of the week. Otherwise, it is easy for our time to slip away. A schedule enables us to use our time effectively, and it causes our pursuit of the truth, our service, and our work to be definite. Those who serve on the college campus need to schedule set times to go to the campus with those who coordinate with them in order to contact students. This kind of scheduling is necessary.</p>
<p>Without a schedule to restrict us, it is easy for our time to slip away. When Moses was forty years old, he thought that he could save the children of Israel. However, the Lord sent him to the wilderness and restricted him there for forty years. This was necessary for Moses. We also have the same need. In order to be restricted and not to let ourselves become loose, we must make a schedule. The Bible refers to this as self-control (Gal. 5:23; 2 Pet. 1:6). As serving ones, we must be diligent to exercise in this matter and not let ourselves become loose. In Taiwan most young men must serve in the military. Once they enter the military camp, they have a tight daily schedule; even the time needed for them to make their beds is calculated. This is very strict. A young working saint is restricted by his job. A teacher is also restricted; the school schedules which day of the week, at what time, and in which classroom he teaches. He is restricted by the schedule of the school. We also must have this kind of schedule to restrict us so that we exercise self-control. In this way we will have a definite goal in our pursuit of the truth and in our service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING CONTRADICTING<br />
OR CONFRONTATIONAL</h2>
<p>Third, we need to learn the lesson to not cause friction in any local church or with any saint. This is not easy, but we still need to learn. No matter where we are, we must not be contradicting or confrontational with the saints.</p>
<p>The Lord is wise and sovereign. In every church there are always a few saints who seem to test others. When the Lord chose the twelve disciples, He included Judas, who betrayed Him (Matt. 10:4). In every local church there are always a few saints who seem to test others. However, if there is only friction between us and them, we will lose our qualification to serve the Lord. There is always ground for reasonings that lead to friction. However, once we begin reasoning, we are finished. Hence, we must learn the lesson to not have problems with the saints involving contradiction or friction. This is possible only when we walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4).</p>
<p>The spirit will never allow us to touch or meddle in others&rsquo; affairs. There is friction when we meddle in others&rsquo; affairs. If we would not meddle, there would not be any friction. Some people in northern China wear woolen clothes because of the cold. This material is like a vacuum cleaner and attracts all the hair and dust in a room. There is another kind of material that is smooth and no hair sticks to it. Some people are born with a meddlesome disposition. They are like the woolen fabric that is full of &ldquo;hair and dust.&rdquo; People with this kind of disposition always have problems, because they provoke others. There are also those whose disposition is pure and simple; they do not get involved, even if they encounter &ldquo;hair and dust.&rdquo; These people are not meddlesome. We should learn to not be meddlesome but to walk according to the spirit. The spirit will never lead us into something with which we should not be involved. Young people like to take a stand for justice. However, in the church there is no such thing as taking a stand for justice. The only thing we walk by in the church is the spirit. The only way to avoid friction and confrontation with the saints is to walk according to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING COMPANIONS FOR THE SAKE OF<br />
PROTECTION AND BENEFIT</h2>
<p>Fourth, a serving one must have companions. Caleb and Joshua and Daniel with his three friends are examples of companions in the Old Testament. They were good companions. In the New Testament the Lord sent His disciples out in twos (Mark 6:7). In Acts the Lord sent Paul and Barnabas out (13:2). This does not mean that companionship involves only two. The Bible speaks of &ldquo;two or three witnesses&rdquo; (Matt. 18:16). When the Lord was transfigured on the mountain, He took three persons with Him: Peter, James, and John (17:1-2). Hence, three is better than two. When two people are together, they can help each other. However, when an argument arises between them, they need a third person to mediate and serve as a buffer. Hence, in serving the Lord it is best to have three in company together, but at least there should be two.</p>
<p>As we look for companions, we should guard against natural affection and the flesh. Leviticus 2:11 says that the meal offering should not contain leaven or honey. Honey is purer than leaven, but it still ferments. According to typology, honey denotes our natural affection. We need to have companions, but our natural affection should not be involved. The sisters should pay particular attention to this point. They should guard against the development of natural affection, or friendships.</p>
<p>There is no spiritual companionship that is life-long. We should not expect our companions to go wherever we go simply because they are our companions. When I was in mainland China, I had a group of companions. When I went to Taiwan, I had another group of companions. Later I went to America, and I had yet another group of companions. Christ has only one Body. Wherever we go, we should live in the Body. Hence, for the sake of our protection and benefit, we need to have two or three companions to support and help us and whom we support and help. This is especially true for single sisters. It is very dangerous for them to serve alone. They need companions even more in order to be balanced and protected.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
A SERVING ONE AND HIS FELLOW WORKERS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>A person who serves the Lord has a relationship not only with his community and with the church but also with his fellow workers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING A PROPER RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH FELLOW WORKERS</h2>
<p>Just as one person cannot play ball alone but must play with others as a team, so a person cannot serve the Lord alone; he must have co-workers. It is not enough for one who serves the Lord to have a proper relationship only with the community and the church. There is still another relationship that is more direct than the relationship with the community and with the church. That relationship is the relationship among the co-workers. This is the most difficult relationship because the sphere of the work of the co-workers is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is universal, whereas the local churches are local. A full-time serving one in the college work in Taipei is in direct coordination with the brothers and sisters in Taipei who take part in the college work, and he must maintain a proper relationship with them. However, he must also maintain a proper relationship with the other full-time serving ones who are in coordination in the college work in other localities. If this relationship is not proper, the work will be hindered. In addition to the college work, there are co-workers serving in junior high schools, in high schools, in the community, with the small groups, and in the children&rsquo;s work. He must also maintain a proper relationship with all these serving ones.</p>
<p>Our view must be broadened. Not only should the co-workers in the smaller sphere of the church in Taipei have a proper relationship among themselves, but the co-workers in all the churches in Taiwan should also maintain a good relationship. This can be compared to the members in our physical body. All the members, whether big or small, must maintain a good relationship with the entire body. Once there is a problem in a part of the body, the whole body suffers. We should not think that having a problem with those who coordinate with us is only a personal matter that will not affect others. Any such problem will affect the whole Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATION BEING<br />
IN THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, His move is matched by the developments in the world. The developments in communication and transportation have made the earth smaller. Events that take place in one part of the earth are immediately known in other places. The Lord has had mercy on His recovery. Even though the total number of saints in the recovery is not large, in the past twenty years this testimony has spread to all continents&mdash;Australia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia. Hence, we are serving as co-workers not only in Taiwan but also in all the continents. There is a coordination among the co-workers. This coordination, which is similar to the coordination of our physical body, is universal. This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing. The Lord has given us a picture in the physical realm and the reality in the spiritual realm. Therefore, once we enter into the coordination of co-workers, our relationship becomes broader. We are serving in Taipei, but we are also related to those who are serving in New Zealand, because whatever we do will affect them either directly or indirectly. For this reason, we must broaden our view.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago a group of brothers who were in their thirties were affected by negative things, and as a result, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery suffered a big loss. Eventually, they went out from among us. This is a warning, and we must learn from it. If they had stayed, they would be middle-aged by now and would be very useful. They would have gone to either Europe, Africa, South America, or Australia. That would have been glorious! Regrettably, they left the work. The Lord has measured a glorious work to us. These brothers are not ignorant of, nor can they deny, the fact that Christ has only one Body. However, since they are unable to do the work of the Body, what they can do is very limited.</p>
<p>When we enter into this work, we must see that we are not individual Christians. We are related to our community and the church, and we have entered into the coordination of the workers. Such a coordination is in the principle of the Body. There are many serving ones whom we have not met, and what we do is directly or indirectly related to them. If we have truly received and learned something from the Lord, others will be willing to receive the supply from us, wherever we are.</p>
<p> The relationship among the serving ones begins locally and then spreads. The Body of Christ is universal. The work is also universal. We must learn this lesson from the beginning of our service. We should never have problems with our fellow workers. When we have a problem with a co-worker, we have a problem with all the co-workers. If we have a problem with a worker who is beside us, we have a problem with all the co-workers in Taipei. If we have a problem with the co-workers in Taipei, we have a problem with all the co-workers in Taiwan. We must pay attention to this matter. It is very serious.</p><h2 class="head1">LAYING THE FOUNDATION OF MAINTAINING<br />
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS</h2>
<p>In the coordination we should not have the thought that if one place does not suit us, we can move to another place. If we leave, we should not expect our work to be blessed by the Lord or that our conscience will be clear. Instead, our conscience will not be sensitive to the Lord. Moreover, it will be easy to regard a new place as our domain. Furthermore, as a result of fellowship and communication among the churches, the saints in the new locality will not be supportive.</p>
<p>In another ten or twenty years the Lord will lead many among us to go abroad to other continents and work for Him. By that time, it will be very common to serve full time. Hence, we must begin now to lay a good foundation. First, we should maintain a good relationship with the unbelieving ones in our community; we should not be rude to them. Even if others in our community are pagans, we should not be rude to them. Concerning our relatives, we should conduct ourselves according to the teaching of the Bible and try our best to maintain a good relationship. Second, we should be the same in the church. We should not have a different attitude toward the saints who do not meet with us; rather, we should maintain a good relationship with them. Third, we should maintain a good relationship with the serving ones. This relationship is not only local or limited to a country; it is universal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING<br />
FOR THE PROPAGATION</h2>
<p>Many of the full-timers among us are not novices. They have received some training and have also spent many years serving in the churches. I hope that these ones will pray and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning the propagation. Gospelizing Taiwan is not a slogan; it is the present direction of the work. There is no arrangement, no centralized authority, and no uniform practice among us. We follow life, and we allow every saint to be led by the Spirit. It is best for two brothers and perhaps one sister to go together. With regard to their livelihood, we have fellowshipped that the full-timers should be supported; that is, their daily necessities should be taken care of by their localities. But there will be other needs related to the work. Hence, we should exercise faith and believe in God. On the one hand, the saints should pray for the co-workers who go out to labor for the Lord, and the saints should support them financially. On the other hand, those who go out should have a spirit of suffering. Yes, the church will take care of our need, but we still need to give everything to the Lord; we should learn to have faith, to pray, and to look to the Lord. The church cannot go with us, but the Lord is going with us and the prayers of the saints will go with us as well.</p>
<p>When I arrived in America in 1963, my pockets were empty and the situation was rather difficult. I still did my best to take care of the needs of the other co-workers. I would rather have suffered lack than have the other co-workers suffer. This is the kind of spirit we should have.</p>
<p>We must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading and pray for the places that need co-workers. We should also fellowship with one another and with older co-workers. We should not wait for the church to seek the Lord on our behalf. We should seek the Lord in order to know where to go. We are the ones seeking the Lord, and we are the ones fighting the battle.</p>
<p>When we go to a new place, we must learn to establish a good fellowship with the local saints and maintain a proper relationship with them. However, we should not depend on them for everything. When I went to America, I was already sixty years old, but I had to learn to cook for myself. We must learn to take care of our practical needs and the needs of the saints. We should learn to do everything necessary to carry out our function. We should even learn to write tracts to take care of the local situation. In America some sisters worked during the day and served in the meeting hall at night. The Western missionaries who went to China served in the same way. Therefore, we should not expect others to do anything that we are unwilling to do. At present our urgent need is to pray. The kind of people we will contact when we go out and the way to contact them are the matters that will need further prayer. May the Lord lead us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
A SERVING ONE AND HIS FELLOW WORKERS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>It is impossible for those who are working for the Lord to work alone. They need co-workers. However, as soon as &ldquo;co&rdquo; is mentioned, we think of an organization. The cooperation among the schools in a university depends entirely on organization. A board of directors hires a president, who then selects the heads of the departments and hires the staff. This is the organization of a university. A person who enters such an organization is clear about his position. He knows whether he is a department head, a teacher, or an office clerk. This is the principle in every business. It is the same with the government. There is a representative body with its councilmen, and there are administrative units with their respective officers.</p>
<p>We do not have organization in the work. This does not mean that everyone can do his own thing. We do not have an organization, but we still <em>co</em>-work. This is something that human culture and society do not have. The human body has no organization, yet all its members co-work every day. Each member knows its position and exercises its function for the body. No one member acts alone. This is the principle that we live by in the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY<br />
AND LIVING IN<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Now that we know the principle of the Body, we should apply it. Suppose a brother is burdened to go to the villages for the propagation. Whom should he fellowship with first? He does not need to seek someone who is far away. He should first fellowship with those who are serving with him. Then he should seek those who have the same burden in order to fellowship and pray with them. Without fellowship, he is not living in the Body. This is not a regulation; it is something spontaneous. When he is burdened for the propagation, he must first fellowship concerning his burden with the ones whom he serves with. He can tell them that he is burdened for the propagation, but he is not clear concerning where to go. Then they can pray with him or pray for him privately. After such fellowship, his business becomes their business, and they can pray together concerning his burden. This is where we should begin our fellowship.</p>
<p>Later, he can approach the elders whom he is close to and who render him help in the Body. This is not a regulation. He is not handing over his responsibility to an organization, nor is he bidding them farewell. This is fellowship in the spirit. Fellowship of life is altogether a matter in the Body. We do not go to the elders to ask for advice nor to receive an order, and the elders should not be political. We must all learn to live in the fellowship of the Body and speak in the spirit.</p>
<p>Here is a further illustration. Suppose the brother goes to a town for the propagation and labors for three weeks. However, he only encounters difficulties on every side. What should he do? It is more than likely that a person who begins laboring for the Lord will encounter such a situation. We should not expect that everything will be smooth when we labor. There will always be adverse circumstances when we go out in a pioneering way, because no one has paved the way for us. Should he pack up his bags and leave, or should he fast and pray? Suppose the Lord seemingly does not hear him; should he return to fellowship with the brothers? We must not forget that we are not alone. We serve in groups of two or three. Instead of going to someone far away, he should first fellowship with the two or three who are with him. Then if the work continues to fail, he can fellowship with the co-workers in his initial locality. This is the proper relationship that we should have with our fellow workers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE NEEDING SKILLS IN ALL AREAS<br />
RELATED TO THEIR FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Suppose three saints go out for the propagation. After they pray and fellowship, one saint may want to do the children&rsquo;s work, another may want to labor with the elderly saints, and the third may want to work with the young people and the young working saints. This way is not wrong, as long as they have thorough fellowship.</p>
<p>Those who go out for the propagation must learn to be skilled in all areas. We should not say that my gift is to preach the gospel, so the others should set up a platform and invite people so that I can give a good message. We should never have such a thought. Rather, we should learn to do everything that is needed in order to carry out our burden. We can set up a platform, we can invite people, we can usher, and we can speak with the gospel friends. We are pioneers; therefore, we need to learn to be skilled in many areas. We should not seek to &ldquo;specialize&rdquo; in only one thing; rather, we should be able to do whatever is needed. We should be neither rigid nor stiff.</p>
<p>We should all be able to do the children&rsquo;s work. It is good enough to gather some children together and teach them to sing a few songs. One does not have to be able to sing well. On the contrary, children like the older sisters who sing short songs off-key. When we go out to work, there should be nothing that we cannot do. If there is a need, we can give a message, or we can do the children&rsquo;s work. We should not have opinions, and we should learn while we work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SPIRIT, KNOWING LIFE,<br />
AND KNOWING THE BODY</h2>
<p>Some of the older retired saints have finished their family obligations, are willing to serve full time, and are burdened for the propagation. Some younger saints can go with the older saints to propagate. An older sister can live with several young saints and be a companion to them. Such a situation would be very sweet and helpful. The older sister can invite the neighborhood children to come and sing songs. The young saints can distribute tracts. We need to receive this fellowship. Do not do things according to the natural concept. We have been influenced by degraded Christianity and limited by our fallen nature; hence, the Lord is limited. I have always endeavored to escape degraded Christianity. Even though Christianity does not like me, it cannot be denied that I have published a large number of books and that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is spreading through the whole world.</p>
<p>We must endeavor to know the Spirit, know life, and know the Body. We should also do our best to live in the spirit, in life, and in the Body. If we coordinate with three saints, we should fellowship with them. If we coordinate with thirty saints, we should fellowship with them. The more fellowship there is, the better. When we fellowship in this way, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will come in.</p></body></html>
