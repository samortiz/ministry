   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF THE WAVE OFFERING AND THE HEAVE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Numbers 18, all the things offered by the people of Israel were referred to as wave offerings and heave offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are not two kinds of offerings, but one offering with two aspects: the wave aspect and the heave aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word wave implies a back and forth movement, and the word heave means to lift up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ, and the heave offering signifies the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ offered Himself in His death, and He became the resurrected and ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Resurrection and ascension are always related to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The resurrected Christ is the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything which we enjoy of Christ is something of resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we have something of Christ to bring to the church meeting to express Christ, this is always something of resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may testify that Christ is our comfort or wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is our comfort and wisdom only by His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The resurrected and ascended Christ is our comfort and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF THE FIVE BASIC KINDS OF OFFERINGS The Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our experience of Christ can be classified into many items and can be typified by the five basic kinds of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we learn to live by Christ, to take Christ as our life, the indwelling Christ will enable us to live a life absolutely for God and not for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the real experience of Christ as the burnt offering Lev 1:1-17; Heb 10:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The indwelling Christ enables us not to live for ourselves in anything but to live for God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ then becomes a living burnt offering within us as we live by Him, taking Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we have this experience of Christ, we can offer what we have in the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may offer a praise by saying, "Lord, we praise You that You are the One living within us to enable us to live a consecrated and separated life."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a praise, giving of thanks, testimony, or message is the offering of Christ as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we offer Him in such a way, He is exhibited, expressed, and exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can also experience Christ as the meal offering Lev 2:1-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we take Christ as our life, we will have a refined daily life in our behavior and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will be fine and pure in our humanity like the fine flour of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This offering is composed of fine flour mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It signifies how Christ lives in us so that we may have a proper, refined, and balanced human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is pleasant and sweet to God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we come to the meetings we can give a testimony, a message, or some praise and thanksgiving which will be an offering of Christ as the meal offering for the enjoyment of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may say, "Lord, we were rough people but thank You for becoming our meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can take You as our refined, even, balanced, and pure life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank You that we can be pleasant, not by ourselves but by You as our life."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can offer this kind of praise if we have the experience, the surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we live by Christ day by day, He will cause us to have a proper human living, to have the fine, sweet, proper human behavior.</S>
