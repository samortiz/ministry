[1]  Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 4 CONTENTS
[2]  In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.
[3]  The topics in chapters 17 through 33 cover matters to practice after believing in the Lord.
[4]  In this volume we begin to examine matters that a believer should know and pursue after being saved.
[5]  The first matter relates to the knowledge of God.
[6]  We need to see and know some crucial points concerning various aspects of God.
[7]  To believe in the Son is to believe in God, to receive the Son is to receive God, and to honor the Son is to honor God because God is in the Son, and the Son is in God.
[8]  I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you John 14:16-17 .
[9]  Although God was manifested among men, He could not enter into man.
[10]  Just as Christ is the embodiment of God, the Spirit is the realization of God.
[11]  Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father ; Of the Son, Your throne, O God ; Why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit...You have not lied to men but to God 1 Pet 1:2; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4; see also Eph 1:17; John 1:1; 2 Cor 3:17-18 .
[12]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit ; There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord; and there are distinction of operations, but the same God ; Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ ; The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit 2 Cor 13:14; 1 Cor 12:4-6; 1 Pet 1:2; Eph 1:17 .
[13]  These portions of the Bible, which speak of the apostle s blessing for the believers, God s inspiration of the believers, God s choosing of the saints, and God s revelation of Himself to the saints, all refer to God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.
[14]  ACCORDING TO THE PURE WORD IN THE BIBLE God Being Unique
[15]  In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ could make His home in our heart.
[16]  God s heart is love, so He loves the world.
[17]  If God s salvation was based only on His love, our salvation would not be firm, because He could cease to love us, and if our salvation was based only on love, God would not be wrong or unrighteous if He ceased to love us.
[18]  You shall be holy because I am holy 1 Pet 1:16; see also Lev 11:44-45; 20:7; Heb 12:14 .
[19]  Because God s nature, His essence, is holy, He wants us to be holy, to be separated from everything other than Him.
[20]  It is equivalent to the Old Testament Hebrew names of El, Eloah, and Elohim.
[21]  It is often used to refer to the Triune God.
[22]  Not only are God s life and power in Christ, but His wisdom and knowledge are also hidden in Christ v. 3 . We must know Christ in order to enjoy everything of God.
[23]  The Bible frequently speaks of the faithfulness of God and the righteousness of God.
[24]  Although the love and grace of God are sweet, they do not contain an intrinsic guarantee that the love and grace of God must be provided.
[25]  By His word God expresses His heart to man so that man can know it, and by His faithfulness God guarantees His love toward man so that man can believe it.
[26]  God s promises are all Yes and Amen in Christ because the God who promises is faithful.
[27]  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins 1 John 1:9 .
[28]  According to the righteousness of God, the Lord Jesus was judged on our behalf.
[29]  When we confess our sins, God is required to forgive us our sins because of the blood that the Lord Jesus shed while being judged according to God s righteousness.
[30]  According to God s word in the Bible, He must forgive us because of His faithfulness.
[31]  Just as the righteousness of God requires Him to forgive us because of the redemption of the Lord Jesus, it also requires Him to cleanse us.
[32]  Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus Rom 3:25-26 .
[33]  In the Old Testament age God s righteousness caused Him to pass over sins, and in the New Testament age God s righteousness causes Him to justify those who are of the faith of Jesus.
[34]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX THE SELECTION AND PREDESTINATION OF GOD
[35]  Every believer was predestinated for salvation long ago by God, and at His appointed time, God arranged the time of our life, the place of our living, the state of our human affairs, and the sphere of our environment to cause us to be saved.
[36]  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .
[37]  God selected and predestinated us according to His foreknowledge in order to conform us to the image of His Son so that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.
[38]  God wants His Son, our Lord Jesus, to gain many brothers that He might be the Firstborn among them.
[39]  God predestinated us to know the mystery of His will, which is according to His economy, His administrative arrangement, so that all things in the heavens and on earth would be headed up in Christ that the glory of Christ, which is His glory in Christ, would be expressed in all things.
[40]  But God has chosen the foolish things of the world that He might shame those who are wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world that He might shame the things that are strong, and the lowborn things of the world and the despised things God has chosen, things which are not, that He might bring to nought the things which are, so that no flesh may boast before God 1 Cor 1:26-29 .
[41]  The union of God and man is a very mysterious matter.
[42]  This is not only an important topic in the Bible but also a central thought in the Word of God.
[43]  God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them Gen 1:26-27 .
[44]  The first time the Bible speaks of man, it speaks of man being created in God s image and according to His likeness.
[45]  God created man in His own image and according to His likeness because He wanted man to be like Him so that He could be joined in union with man.
[46]  This mystery is great because it involves God and man being joined together, and it is related to godliness because this mystery makes man like God, the same as God in life and nature.
[47]  In this chapter and the next we will cover two topics concerning Christ the person of Christ and the precious blood of Christ.
[48]  The person of Christ relates to who Christ is, and the precious blood relates to what He has done.
[49]  If we want to know Christ, we must know His person and the preciousness of His blood.
[50]  Although the Lord Jesus is the eternal God and the Creator in time, He became flesh; that is, He became a man through human birth.
[51]  The eternal Word, the eternal God, was born as a man in time; He became flesh.
[52]  In eternity He could not be seen or contacted as God, but in time, when He became flesh, He could be seen and contacted.
[53]  Being the Mighty God means that He is the very God with the glory and authority of God.
[54]  From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power ; Designated the Son of God in power...out of the resurrection of the dead Matt 26:64; Rom 1:4; see also Acts 7:56 .
[55]  Following the Lord s resurrection from the dead, He was still the Son of Man, even though He was also designated the Son of God in power.
[56]  When He was judged by the Jewish Sanhedrin, the high priest asked Him whether He was the Son of God.
[57]  Through His resurrection from the dead, He dispensed His life as the Son of God into us to regenerate us 1 Pet 1:3 , and we became the many sons of God who are His many brothers.
[58]  The person of Christ speaks of who He is, whereas the blood of Christ speaks of His work.
[59]  The blood is the foundation upon which we receive all grace and blessing; therefore, it occupies an important position in the Bible.
[60]  According to the Bible, the blood of Christ functions in at least twelve ways in relation to the believers.
[61]  The blood shed through the death of Christ paid the price required by God s righteousness; consequently, God can legally and righteously grace us.
[62]  The blood of the Lord not only redeems us from our sins, but it also establishes a covenant with us that requires God to forgive our sins, grace us, and accomplish all His promises to us.
[63]  Washed us from our sins in his own blood Rev 1:5, KJV .
[64]  The Lord s blood causes sins not only to be forgiven but also to be cleansed.
[65]  The Lord s blood is not only the foundation of our forgiveness but also the means for us to be cleansed.
[66]  Because the Lord s blood washed us of our sins, it enabled us to obtain God s holy life, which is God Himself as the eternal life.
[67]  However, since the Lord s blood has satisfied the righteous requirement of God s law and redeemed us from our sins before God, His blood speaks for us before God.
[68]  The law and grace are two great matters in the Bible.
[69]  If we want to know God and how He deals with man, we must know the law and grace.
[70]  Every requirement of the law on us and every demand on us is according to God s holy nature, righteousness, and goodness because the law is holy, righteous, and good.
[71]  In God s way of dealing with man, the law was added along the way because of man s transgressions so that man s offense might abound.
[72]  God originally wanted and still wants to deal with man according to grace, but man did not know himself, so he did not see his need for the grace of God.
[73]  The law is not of faith, yet, He who does them shall live because of them Gal 3:12; see also Rom 10:5; Lev 18:5 .
[74]  His grace,...which He caused to abound to us... according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself Eph 1:6, 8-9 .
[75]  God s grace is given to us according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself.
[76]  According to the context of these verses, good pleasure refers to what God purposed before the foundation the world v. 4 . God purposed to give us grace before the foundation of the world.
[77]  God has given us grace in order to accomplish the mystery of His will to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, so that Christ would be the center and Head expressing God s multifarious wisdom and shaming Satan and his angels.
[78]  Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due.
[79]  But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness Rom 4:4-5 .
[80]  If we compare his words yet not I but the grace of God with his words in Galatians 2:20, it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ, we can realize that the grace of God is just Christ.
[81]  A COMPARISON OF THE LAW AND GRACE The Law Added in alongside Rom 5:20 .
[82]  There are two special phrases in the Bible that speak of a basic truth concerning God s salvation: in Adam and in Christ.
[83]  When we receive Christ and enter into Him through believing and being baptized, God puts the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into our spirit, causing us to be joined to Him.
[84]  Just as death entered into us because of Adam s sin and defiled our whole being our spirit, soul, and body the life of God entered into us because of Christ s righteousness to enliven our entire being our spirit, soul, and body by swallowing up every element of death in us.
[85]  Christ s death dealt with Adam s sin so that we could receive God s righteousness in Him, and Christ s resurrection dealt with Adam s death so that we could receive God s life in Him.
[86]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE TWO NATURES OF THE BELIEVERS
[87]  Every believer has two natures, and if we desire to grow in the divine life, we must have a clear knowledge of these two natures.
[88]  Every brother and sister, especially the younger ones, must pay attention to this crucial truth.
[89]  When we live according to the old man, we are living according to the devil s life and nature, so we are living out the devil s life and manifesting his nature.
[90]  Our old man has been crucified with Him Rom 6:6 .
[91]  Since our old man is exceedingly evil and corrupt, God deals with it by death.
[92]  Since our flesh is evil to the uttermost and incurable, and since it is at enmity with God and cannot be subject to God, God can only put the flesh to death, using the cross of Christ to crucify our old man.
[93]  The new man is a matter utterly related to the mingling of God s life with redeemed humanity, and the new man has no connection to the old man, which is the issue of God s creation being mixed with the satanic life and nature.
[94]  God is in the heavens, Christ is out of heaven, and the Holy Spirit descends from heaven, so our new man, who is from God, in Christ, and born of the Holy Spirit, is also out of heaven.
[95]  Our new man is born of God and has the divine nature.
[96]  When we live by the new man, we spontaneously know God s preferences, inclinations, and tendencies, and our living has the flavor of God.
[97]  Whereas the old man obeys the aggregate evil spirit that is now operating in the sons of disobedience, the new man is led by the Spirit of God through the inward abiding of the Holy Spirit.
[98]  Just as the aggregate evil spirit operates within the realm of the old man, causing the old man to follow Satan, the Holy Spirit operates in the realm of the new man, causing the new man to follow God.
[99]  The old man is of the devil and obeys the aggregate evil spirit, so the old man is at enmity with God, but the new man is out of God and follows the Holy Spirit, so the new man loves God.
[100]  The New Man Being Christ Abiding in the Believers
[101]  The old man is out of Adam and in Adam, so the old man is just Adam.
[102]  Similarly, the new man is out of Christ and in Christ, so the new man is just Christ.
[103]  When we live by the old man, we live by Adam and live out the life of Adam, which is Adam himself, but when we live by the new man, we live by Christ and live out the life of Christ, which is Christ Himself.
[104]  Just as God used the cross to put the old man to death to destroy Adam and the life of Adam within us, God makes the new man alive through Christ to live out Christ and the life of Christ within us.
[105]  Our two natures oppose each other so that we would not do the things we desire and so that we could obey God, follow God s will, and do the things that are pleasing to God.
[106]  CHAPTER FORTY-THREE THREE KINDS OF LIFE AND FOUR LAWS
[107]  This topic may be unfamiliar to many, but it is based on the clear word of the Bible, and our experience also confirms it.
[108]  If we want to experience the spiritual life, understand the operation of God s life within us, and live an overcoming life free from sin, we must realize that there are three kinds of life and four laws that affect our living.
[109]  THREE KINDS OF LIFE IN THE GARDEN Adam Representing Man;
[110]  Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden...and there He put the man...the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:8-9 .
[111]  The Bible speaks of Satan as God s enemy, and it reveals that there is a struggle between Satan and God over man.
[112]  God wants to gain man to accomplish His purpose, and Satan wants to gain man to destroy God s purpose.
[113]  THREE KINDS OF LIFE The Life of Man, Received through Creation, Being Good and Upright
[114]  Everything that He had made...was very good Gen 1:31 .
[115]  Following His creation, God saw that everything He had made, including man, was very good.
[116]  FOUR LAWS The Law of God the Law of the Old Testament
[117]  I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me...I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members Rom 7:21, 23 .
[118]  If we had only the law of good in our mind, we would be able to successfully serve the law of God.
[119]  The Law of the Spirit of Life in Our Spirit
[120]  The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death Rom 8:2 .
[121]  Unbelievers only know the law of good and the law of sin because they have only the good, created human life and the evil, fallen satanic life.
[122]  Therefore, there is another law in us that comes out of the divine life of God.
[123]  This law is called the law of the Spirit of life because this law comes out of the Spirit of God, who is life.
[124]  We have the law of good, which comes out of the good nature of our human life, the law of sin, which comes out of the evil nature of the satanic life, and the law of the Spirit of life, which comes out of the divine nature of God s eternal life.
[125]  A believer who follows the lusts of his flesh can express the things of his fallen satanic nature, and a believer who walks by the spirit can express the things of God s divine nature as a God-man who lives out God.
[126]  But if we live according to our spirit, that is, according to the Holy Spirit and according to God, we will be a God-man who is full of life and who lives out the life of God.
[127]  Instead, God s salvation involves the impartation of His Spirit of life into our spirit, enabling our innermost part to respond to the law of the Spirit of life so that we can live by God s life and become God-men who flow out God s life because we are full of God s life.
[128]  Although the outward law of God places demands on us, it has no power to enable us to fulfill its demands because of the weakness of our flesh v. 3 . The law of good in our mind desires to fulfill the demands of the law of God, but it has no power to overcome the law of sin.
[129]  OF BEING FREED FROM SIN Setting the Mind on the Flesh
[130]  Resulting in Sins because of the Law of Sin
[131]  Since the sinful life of Satan dwells in the flesh and operates according to a law that causes people to sin, when we live in the flesh and set our mind on the flesh, the law of sin causes us to oppose, contradict, and offend God.
[132]  Although we have covered some items related to our union with Christ in other chapters, it is a very important topic that needs to be covered in more detail in this chapter.
[133]  I hope we would pay adequate attention to this truth.
[134]  The goal of God s work is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself so that we would be joined as one with Him.
[135]  Therefore, when we speak of our union with God, we are also speaking of our union with Christ.
[136]  Christ is the manifestation of God; consequently, Christ s coming to be in union with us is equal to God s coming to be in union with us.
[137]  Christ is God, and He had the form of God v. 6 , but in order to be in union with us, He emptied Himself and lowered Himself, taking the form of a human slave, becoming in the likeness of men to be found in fashion as a man.
[138]  When we believed, Christ entered into us and entered into union with us.
[139]  God will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out the light of God through the believers in our union with Him.
[140]  God will shine His light out through Christ, and Christ will shine His light out from us.
[141]  Just as a bronze serpent was hung upon a pole to bear God s judgment on the children of Israel, Christ became sin for us and was hung upon a tree to bear God s judgment for us.
[142]  He entered into union with us and became sin for us, bearing God s condemnation and judgment so that we could enter into union with Him and become the righteousness of God in Him, being justified by God and becoming pleasing to God.
[143]  Raised us up together with Him Eph 2:6; see also Col 3:1 .
[144]  Since we are in union with Christ in His death, we surely are in union with Him in His resurrection.
[145]  Abide in Him 1 John 2:27, 28; see also John 15:4-7 .
[146]  When we were saved, God put us into Christ and brought us into union with Christ.
[147]  Therefore, after we are saved, we should abide in Christ to remain in the experience of our union with Him.
[148]  This life is hidden with Christ in God, so in this life, we are in union with Him in God.
[149]  God, in His salvation, wants to work on us to such an extent that Christ becomes one with us and we become one with Christ so that Christ and we, we and Christ, would be in complete union.
[150]  CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE SERVICE OF THE NEW COVENANT
[151]  The service of the new covenant is completely different from the service of the old covenant because of its special characteristics.
[152]  Therefore, we need to look at the special characteristics of the new covenant.
[153]  We do not need anyone to teach us to know God, because we have the law of life within, and we also have His anointing within that teaches us concerning all things and causes us to know God.
[154]  We who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another Rom 12:5 .
[155]  The believers who serve God are the Body of Christ, the church, and are members one of another, manifesting their function in the Body.
[156]  In the new covenant God wants the believers in Christ to express Christ throughout the universe as the Body of Christ, which is the church.
[157]  The service of the new covenant is not according to ordinances or letters but according to the power of life and the Spirit.
[158]  Believers who desire to live an overcoming life must see the relationship between the believers and sins.
[159]  There are many different views concerning this matter; however, we will consider only our relationship to sins, both before and after our salvation, according to the revelation in the Bible.
[160]  Forgiving eliminates the record of sin before the law of God, wiping away removes the trace of sin upon us, and not remembering erases the impression of our sin from God s memory.
[161]  Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[162]  Although the grace of God abounds because of sin, we must leave our sins behind and be dead to sin.
[163]  Although there are many views concerning whether or not a believer who sins after being saved is truly saved, we must see what is the truth according to the Bible.
[164]  Sins do not result in the loss of our eternal salvation, even if we experience God s discipline and punishment.
[165]  When we grow, we can be useful to God and blessed by Him, but if we do not grow and our condition is not proper, we can be punished by God and suffer loss.
[166]  Instead, we should be brought on to maturity v. 1 . If we fall away from the Lord s teaching after we are saved, having been enlightened by God, having tasted of His heavenly grace, having gained His Holy Spirit, having tasted that God is good, and knowing the powers of the age to come, we simply need to get up and go forward.
[167]  Thus, if he goes back to Judaism to worship God with offerings, he will not only lose the new covenant blessing but will also be punished by falling into the hands of the living God v. 31 . Going back to offer the blood of bulls and rams for redemption is also a treading on and a despising of the Son of God, because it treats His blood as something common, like the blood of bulls and rams.
[168]  If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins 1 John 2:1-2 .
[169]  If we commit sins after our salvation, we have the Lord Jesus as our Advocate and as the propitiation for our sins.
[170]  We can be recovered by the Lord because He Himself is the basis of our propitiation with God.
[171]  Under the grace of God and with God in Christ as our life and power, sin cannot lord it over us; consequently, we can avoid sin.
[172]  He who has died is justified from sin Rom 6:7 .
[173]  Only death can enable us to avoid sin because death frees a person from sin.
[174]  Our death with Christ causes sin to lose its authority over us so that we can be freed from sin, and our resurrection with Christ makes us living to God, causes us to live in God, and gives Him a position in us.
[175]  The way for us to avoid sin and to be freed from sin is to see the reality of our death with Christ, to reckon ourselves dead in Christ, to consecrate ourselves to God, to live according to the law of the Spirit of life, and to live in fellowship with the Lord by walking according to the Spirit and minding the things of the Spirit.
