   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT BEING THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gal 3:2-3, 5, 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the negative side, Galatians 1 exposes religion with its traditions, and chapter 2 speaks of the law with its ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the positive side, however, chapter 1 shows us Christ revealed in us, and chapter 2 unveils Christ living in us 1:15-16a; 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not care for religion, even the religion of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We drop the -anity and keep only Christ, the One who is revealed in us and now lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, Christ revealed in us and Christ living in us are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ and the church are the contents of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter 3 the Spirit is mentioned four times: Receive the Spirit...out of the hearing of faith v. 2 ; having begun by the Spirit v. 3 ; bountifully supplies to you the Spirit v. 5 ; and receive the promise of the Spirit through faith v. 14 . God promised the Spirit to us, we have received the ministered Spirit, and we have begun in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we need to go on in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This chapter also speaks of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 3 says, Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as in chapter 1 Christ is in contrast with religion, in chapter 3 the Spirit is in contrast with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both religion and the law are related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After having begun in the Spirit, to make laws for ourselves is to try to perfect ourselves in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to forget about keeping the law in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN GALATIANS 3, CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BEING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way to leave the law behind and get out of the flesh is to turn to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as religion and the law are related to the flesh, Christ is related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In actuality, Christ is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The very Christ in Galatians 1 and 2 is the Spirit in chapter 3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If Christ were not the Spirit, how could He be revealed in us and live in us?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All Christians know that Christ died on the cross, was resurrected, and is now sitting on the throne in the third heaven, but if this were all, He would be far away from us and unable to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, Christ as the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit today is like the air that we breathe John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, He is in the heavens, but on the other hand, He is also within us Rom 8:34, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the One who died on the cross for our sins, resurrected from the tomb, and ascended to heaven, He is Jesus Christ, but as the One who has come into us, He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the Father in eternity Isa 9:6 , and in time He is the One who created the universe Col 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is also the One who came as a small child and was laid in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the man Jesus who lived on earth, the redeeming Lamb of God that took away our sins on the cross, the Christ who resurrected to be our Savior, the Lord of all, who is sitting on the throne in the third heaven, and the coming King.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the real God, the real man, life, light, wisdom, power, patience, kindness, love, and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, He is the Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From eternity to eternity Christ is everything and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The revelation in Galatians is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapters 1 and 2 the Lord is Christ, but in chapter 3 He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never consider Christ and the Spirit to be separate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For redemption and as the One in the heavens, He is Christ, and for life imparting and as the One who indwells us, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>BEING DELIVERED FROM THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>TO LIVE CHRIST IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The positive factor in chapter 3 is the Spirit, and the negative factor is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flesh here is simply the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not husbands love their wives and wives submit to their husbands, they still have the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If some are proud, they have the flesh, and if others are humble, they also have the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, whether or not someone keeps the law, he has the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this respect, there is no difference between people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a tiger loves you or hates you, it is still a tiger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same principle, if a person loves or hates out from himself, he is still a person in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be those who say, Praise the Lord, I am not living in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By His mercy I am in the Spirit, and I live not by myself but by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Luke 14:26 Jesus said, If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that we must not only love but also hate in a holy, divine way by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What matters is not whether we love or hate but whether it is we or Christ as the Spirit who loves or hates.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It must be no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s salvation is not to save us from hell to heaven or from doing wrong to doing right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is to save us from one person to another One, that is, from our self to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, we are too accustomed to being in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason, God must come again and again in His mercy and grace to snatch us out of our self and bring us back into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have been delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love Col 1:13 , but practically speaking, we slip back into the old realm of our self many times, like someone who returns to his former home for a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every husband has sinned against his wife, and every wife against her husband, simply because we are too often in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is why we need to call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the simplest way to get out of the flesh and into the Spirit 1 Cor 12:3b; Rom 10:12-13 .</S>
