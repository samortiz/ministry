   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Our Soul Becoming Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second aspect is found in verse 6: "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mind is the leading part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As such, it represents our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that when the mind becomes life, our soul becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First our spirit is life, and then our soul also becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In whatever we do and say, we must be sure that our mind is on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When our mind is off our spirit, we are like an electrical appliance which has been disconnected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we sense that our mind is not on our spirit, we should stop and call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of us can testify that after simply calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we had the sense deep within that, once again, our mind was on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although this is simple matter, it is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. Life Imparted to Our Mortal Bodies</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, life is imparted to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to verse 11, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we allow the indwelling Spirit to make His home in our being, this indwelling Spirit will saturate our dying, mortal body with resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our mortal body will be enlivened, quickened, and healed with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, life is imparted to us in a threefold way: Our spirit becomes life, our mind becomes life, and life is imparted to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason we can say that, according to Romans 8, the Triune God is dispensed into the tripartite man and gives life to man's spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. Our Whole Being Saturated with God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thy Spirit will me saturate,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every part will God permeate....</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hymns, #501</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our relationship with God should reach to this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our whole being must be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be content with outwardly worshipping Him, loving Him, fearing Him, and doing things to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This mysterious God has passed through a process: creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now He has returned as the Spirit to enter all who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such is our God and our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He does not want us to worship Him from afar.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not want us to stand in awe of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nor does He want us to perform certain duties to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What He wants is that we open the deepest part of our being to Him and call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then His Spirit comes into us, making our deadened spirit life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From there He spreads out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we set our mind on the spirit, the soul too is saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It also becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the soul, life spreads also to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The resurrection life saturates it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When every part of us is saturated with this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we are in the union that God wants.</S>
