   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that at the end of His life, the Lord Jesus literally entered into death and was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But after His physical burial, in which He was absolutely and thoroughly terminated, He was bodily resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By His resurrection the divine life within Him was fully released.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the life-giving Spirit, He entered into the disciples and infused them with His life, the life that lived always under the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This enabled the disciples to live in the form, in the model, in the mold, of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the Apostle Paul could declare, "I have been crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. Paul lived, not by his own life, but by Christ as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING AND DOING</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is important to see the difference between doing something and dying that we may live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Doing things is according to the old ordination, but dying to live Christ is according to the new ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have seen, God today does not want us to do anything; He only wants us to die that we may live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what it means to be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This vision needs to control us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, as you are about to love someone, you need to consider whether you are loving by your self or by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same is true with the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you preach the gospel by your self or by Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God does not want you to preach the gospel in your self; He wants you to preach the gospel by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need to be able to say, "It is not I who preach the gospel; it is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to live a life under the death of Christ until the redemption of our body, until we are literally and thoroughly terminated and enter into resurrection with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Until that happens, we must live in the principle of having our human life buried so that we may live by the divine life, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To do this is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are all in the process of being conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's death is the model, the form, for our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our very being needs to be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that our human life is always under death so that we no longer have our being according to our human life, but according to Christ.</S>
