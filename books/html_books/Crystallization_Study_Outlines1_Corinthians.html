<h1 class="title">Called into the Fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son&mdash;<br />
the Enjoyment of the All-inclusive Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:1-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The essential and underlying thought of 1 Corinthians is that we should enjoy Christ&mdash;10:3-4.</li>
<li>The underlying thought of 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 is that we must drop everything except Christ and take Christ as everything to us&mdash;2:2.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours&rdquo;&mdash;1:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ, the all-inclusive One, belongs to all believers; He is our portion given to us by God&mdash;Col. 1:12.</li>
	<li>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 <em>theirs and ours</em> emphasizes the fact of Christ being the unique center of all believers in whatever place or situation.</li>
	<li>First Corinthians reveals that God has given to us the all-inclusive Christ, with the riches of at least twenty items, as our unique portion for our enjoyment&mdash;vv. 24, 30; 2:8, 10; 3:11; 5:7-8; 10:3-4; 11:3; 12:12; 15:20, 23, 47, 45.</li>
	<li>God has determined that in His economy one person&mdash; His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;must be everything to all the believers&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Col. 3:11.</li>
	<li>In His economy God&rsquo;s intention is to give Christ to us as our portion and to work Christ into us&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19; Eph. 3:17a.</li>
	<li>We should focus on Christ as our unique center appointed by God that all the problems among the believers may be solved.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord&rdquo;&mdash; 1 Cor. 1:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God has called us into the fellowship of His Son that we may partake of Christ, participate in Him, and enjoy Him as our God-given portion.</li>
	<li>God has called us into the fellowship of, the participation in, the all-inclusive Christ; all believers should be focused on Him, not being distracted by any gifted person, any overstressed doctrine, or any particular practice.</li>
	<li>Fellowship means that we and Christ have become one&mdash;6:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have been called into a oneness where we are one with Him and He is one with us.</li>
		<li>The word <em>joined</em> in 6:17 is a synonym for <em>fellowship</em> in 1:9; the joining is actually the fellowship.</li>
		<li>Whenever we are one spirit with the Lord, we are in the fellowship of Christ, and we experience Him as the all-inclusive One.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Fellowship means that we enjoy Christ and all He is and that He enjoys us and all we are&mdash;Phil. 1:18; 2:17-18, 28; 3:1; 4:4, 10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have been called into a mutuality in which we enjoy what the Son of God is and He enjoys what we are.</li>
		<li>This fellowship implies a wonderful, universal, mutual enjoyment&mdash;our enjoyment of the Triune God, the Triune God&rsquo;s enjoyment of us, and the enjoyment which the believers have with one another.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fellowship of Christ becomes the fellowship the apostles shared with the believers in Christ in His Body, the church&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is the fellowship that we enjoy in partaking of His blood and His body at His table&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16, 21.</li>
		<li>Such a fellowship must be unique because He is unique; it forbids any division among the members of His unique Body&mdash;12:27.</li>
		<li>This fellowship involves not only the oneness between us and the Triune God but also the oneness among all the believers&mdash;John 17:21-23; Eph. 4:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fellowship of Christ is actually carried out by the Spirit; thus, in our experience the fellowship of the Son is the fellowship of the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1.</li>
	<li>Fellowship also implies a mutual flowing among the believers&mdash;1 John 1:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the New Testament fellowship describes the flowing both between us and the Lord and between us and one another&mdash;Phil. 2:1.</li>
		<li>The flow, the current, we have in our spiritual fellowship involves both oneness and life; our fellowship is a flow of oneness.</li>
		<li>This fellowship is the reality of the church life&mdash; 1 Cor. 1:9, 2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our only preference must be Christ as the unique center, the Christ who is theirs and ours, the Christ into whose fellowship we have been called by God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To have a preference is to lose Christ as the unique center and to be in the flesh&mdash;vv. 2, 9, 11-13; 3:1-4.</li>
		<li>The all-inclusive Christ is our unique choice, preference, portion, taste, and enjoyment&mdash;1:24, 30; 2:2.</li>
		<li>We must exalt only one name&mdash;the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the name of the wonderful, all-inclusive One into whose fellowship God has called us&mdash;Phil. 2:9-11; Eph. 1:21.</li>
		<li>Only one thing can keep us from division&mdash;the realization that the all-inclusive Christ is our portion and that we have been called into the fellowship, the enjoyment, of such a One&mdash;Col. 1:12; 2:9, 16-17; 3:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 1:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Speaking differently is a predominant characteristic of fallen man; the desire of God is that all His saved and redeemed people speak the same thing.</li>
	<li>If we would be attuned to the same mind and in the same opinion, we need to have a vision of the place of Christ in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Col. 3:11.</li>
	<li>If we see the all-inclusive Christ and learn the secret of enjoying Him, our way of thinking and speaking will be changed&mdash;Phil. 2:2, 5; 3:15; Rom. 15:6.</li>
	<li>The only way to avoid division is to see Christ, receive Christ, and enjoy Christ; this and only this will cause us to be attuned to the same mind and in the same opinion.</li>

<h1 class="title">Enjoying the Crucified Christ<br />
as the Unique Solution to All Problems in the Church</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:23-24, 30;<br />
2:2, 9-10; 5:7-8; 10:4; 15:45b; 1 Pet. 2:24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The death of Christ has become God&rsquo;s power to eliminate all the problems in the universe; thus, Christ crucified is God&rsquo;s power to abolish all negative things and carry out His plan&mdash;1:23-24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The human way of solving problems is to negotiate, but God&rsquo;s way is to terminate; the best way to solve problems among people is to terminate everyone involved&mdash;Gal. 2:20; cf. 1 Cor. 6:7-8.</li>
		<li>The crucifixion of Christ has silenced the entire universe and simplified the extremely complicated situation in the universe&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we enjoy the crucified Christ, all that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do are completely terminated, and His resurrection life is imparted through us into others&mdash;John 12:24-26; 2 Cor. 4:10-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The enjoyment of the crucified Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit solves all the problems in the church and issues in the growth in life for the building up of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 1:23; 2:2; 15:45b; 6:17; 3:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The crucified Christ is the unleavened bread to be a feast to us&mdash;5:6-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Leaven signifies evil things and evil doctrines (vv. 6, 8; Matt. 16:6, 11-12); since Christ is unleavened, if we feast on Him daily, we can have an unleavened church life.</li>
		<li>We need to enjoy Christ as our unleavened banquet for the entire period of our Christian life&mdash;1 Cor. 5:7-8; Exo. 12:15-20; cf. 13:4-9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The crucified Christ whom we enjoy today as our feast is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, and included in His being is His killing death; as long as we enjoy Him, we will be nourished, and the negative elements within us will be killed&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Exo. 30:23-25.</li>
			<li>To eat the Lord Jesus, to feast on Him, is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life; we can eat Him by eating His words&mdash;John 6:57, 63; Jer. 15:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The crucified Christ is our spiritual rock who was smitten and cleft by God to flow Himself out as the spiritual water for us to drink&mdash;1 Cor. 10:4; John 19:34; Exo. 17:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to call on the Lord continually and draw water with joy from Him as the fountain of living water&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13, 3b; Isa. 12:3-4; John 4:10, 14.</li>
		<li>We need to speak to the Lord constantly to receive Him as the living water&mdash;Num. 20:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The crucified Christ is the power of God for us to live in any kind of environment and to live out every kind of virtue&mdash;1 Cor. 1:18, 24; Eph. 1:19-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are able to live a contented life in any kind of environment by Christ as our inward power&mdash;Phil. 4:11-13.</li>
		<li>We are able to live Christ out as every kind of virtue by Him as our inward power; to live a life of these virtues is much more difficult than doing a Christian work&mdash;vv. 13, 8.</li>
		<li>We can enjoy the transmission of Christ as the power of God and the transfusion of Christ as the peace of God by practicing fellowship with Him in prayer&mdash;vv. 6-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The crucified Christ is the wisdom of God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ became wisdom to us from God to transmit all that He is into our tripartite being for His eternal expression, making us the masterpiece of God for the wise exhibition of all that Christ is&mdash;Eph. 2:10; 3:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is our righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life&mdash;Rom. 5:18; 8:10.</li>
			<li>Christ is our sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul&mdash; transformed in our mind, emotion, and will&mdash; with His divine life&mdash;6:19, 22.</li>
			<li>Christ is our redemption (for our future), the redemption of our body, by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness&mdash;8:23; Phil. 3:21.</li>
			<li>It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;organically one with Christ and makes Christ everything to us&mdash;cf. Eph. 5:25-27.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refer not only to three stages of God&rsquo;s salvation but also to three aspects of the nature of God&rsquo;s salvation that we need to experience daily.</li>
		<li>When we lay hold of Christ as the personified wisdom of God, He becomes the reality of the tree of life to us for us to minister Christ as life to others&mdash; Prov. 3:18-19; 2 Chron. 1:10; Col. 2:2-3; 1:28; 1 Tim. 5:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The crucified Christ is our Healer, our healing tree&mdash; Exo. 15:22-26; 1 Pet. 2:24; John 11:25; Rev. 2:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we experience the healing tree of the cross of Christ and live a crucified life, our bitter situation becomes sweet.</li>
		<li>We need to apply the cross of Christ to our whole being, that the bitterness within us may be healed and changed into sweetness.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The crucified Christ is the depths, the deep things, of God&mdash;1 Cor. 2:6-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The deep things of God are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God&mdash;Rom. 11:33; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17.</li>
		<li>To realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us to love Him&mdash;2:9; Mark 12:30; cf. 1 Cor. 16:22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets&mdash;Psa. 73:25; 25:14.</li>
			<li>When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion&mdash;1 Cor. 2:10-12.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Goal of 1 Corinthians</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 2:10-16; 3:1, 3, 16; 14:32, 37; 4:1</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The goal of 1 Corinthians was to motivate the Corinthian believers who were soulish, fleshy, and fleshly to aspire to the growth in life that they might become spiritual men for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;2:15; 3:1, 3; 14:32, 37:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First Corinthians reveals that a believer may be one of three kinds of men:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A believer may be a spiritual man, living in his spirit under the anointing of the Holy Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:25; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>A spiritual man is one who does not behave according to the flesh or act according to the soulish life but lives according to the spirit, that is, his spirit mingled with the Spirit of God; such a man is ruled and controlled by his spirit&mdash;2:15.</li>
			<li>A spiritual man denies his soul and does not live by his soul but allows his spirit, that is, his regenerated spirit, which is occupied and energized by the Spirit of God, to dominate his entire being.</li>
			<li>A spiritual man is dominated, governed, directed, moved, and led by his mingled spirit&mdash;5:3-5a; 6:17; 2 Cor. 2:13-14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>A believer may be a soulish man, living in his soul under the direction of the soul, the natural life&mdash; 1 Cor. 2:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>A soulish man is a natural man, one who allows his soul (including the mind, the emotion, and the will) to dominate his entire being and who lives by his soul, ignoring his spirit, not using his spirit, and even behaving as if he did not have a spirit&mdash;Jude 19.</li>
			<li>Such a man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, and he is not able to know them; to such natural men the things of the Spirit of God are foolishness&mdash;1 Cor. 1:22-23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>A believer may be a fleshy and fleshly man, being of the flesh and living in the flesh under the influence of the nature of the flesh&mdash;3:1, 3:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Fleshy</em> denotes being made of flesh; <em>fleshly</em> denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh and partaking of the character of the flesh.</li>
			<li>The jealousy and strife among the Corinthian believers show that they walked according to the flesh of the fallen man and not according to the human spirit regenerated by God&mdash;vv. 3-4; 1:11-12; Gal. 5:19-21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Lord desires that all His believers take His grace to be the first kind of man&mdash;a spiritual man&mdash;6:18; Rev. 22:21.</li>
		<li>As we have been called by God into the fellowship of Christ (1 Cor. 1:9), who is now the life-giving Spirit (15:45b), and as we are one spirit with Him (6:17), we can experience and enjoy Him only when we live in our spirit under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our spirit is typified by the Holy of Holies and the good land; we must live and serve in our spirit for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;John 4:24; 1 Cor. 14:32; Rom. 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are the temple of God, and the three parts of our being correspond to the three parts of the temple: our body corresponds to the outer court, our soul to the Holy Place, and our spirit to the Holy of Holies, which is the very residence of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who is the presence of the Triune God&mdash;1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; John 14:16-20.</li>
		<li>The three parts of our being also correspond to the three places of Israel&rsquo;s journey: Egypt corresponds to the flesh (our fallen body), the wilderness to our soul, and the good land to our spirit where Christ as the reality of the good land dwells:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the reality of the good land in our spirit, making our mingled spirit the land of Immanuel&mdash;Gal. 3:14; Matt. 1:23; 2 Tim. 4:22; Isa. 8:7-8, 10.</li>
			<li>In 1 Corinthians Paul likened the Corinthians to the children of Israel, who experienced Christ as the Passover in Egypt (5:7) and who wandered in the wilderness, experiencing Christ as the heavenly manna and as the spiritual rock which flowed out the living water (10:3-4).</li>
			<li>The record of entering into the good land is in 2 Corinthians, which is an autobiography of a person in the spirit; the good land in 2 Corinthians is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit given to us as the divine grace in our spirit for our enjoyment&mdash;13:14; 12:9; cf. Heb. 10:29.</li>
			<li>Paul&rsquo;s burden is for us to enter into and enjoy the reality of the good land, the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit of grace in our spirit, today&rsquo;s Holy of Holies, for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;2 Cor. 2:13; John 14:16-20; Heb. 9:3-4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to experience all the aspects of Christ in 1 Corinthians for God&rsquo;s building is through the two spirits, the divine Spirit and the regenerated human spirit, mingled together as one spirit&mdash;2:10-16; John 3:6; 4:24; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Only the spirit of man can know the things of man; the things of man include man&rsquo;s position, situation, condition, need, source, and destiny&mdash;cf. Mark 2:8a.</li>
	<li>Only the Spirit of God can know the deep things of God&mdash;1 Cor. 2:10-11.</li>
	<li>When we exercise our spirit to know the things of man, we are ushered into the Spirit of God to know Christ as the deep things of God; we must move, act, and live in our spirit that we may enjoy Christ as everything to us&mdash;vv. 9-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Corinthian believers had neglected the spirit of man and the Spirit of God, having turned instead to live in their mind by philosophy.</li>
		<li>Hence, 1 Corinthians shows that the proper experience of these two spirits is essential for the practice of the church life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A spiritual man is a steward of the mysteries of God (Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ), a dispenser of the divine life supply to God&rsquo;s children for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;4:1; Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A spiritual man has the mind of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 2:15-16.</li>
		<li>A spiritual man speaks the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, with spiritual words, which are words taught by the Spirit; furthermore, only a spiritual man can receive them; this divine speaking is prophesying for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;vv. 13-15; 14:4b, 31-32.</li>

<h1 class="title">Growing Christ as the Precious Materials<br />
for God&rsquo;s Building</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:1-17</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s goal is to have a farm that will grow materials for the building up of His holy temple as His dwelling place&mdash;3:6-7, 9, 12, 16-17.</li>
<li>The believers, who have been regenerated in Christ with God&rsquo;s life, are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, a farm in God&rsquo;s new creation to grow Christ that precious materials may be produced for God&rsquo;s building&mdash; cf. 4:15.</li>
<li>Paul regarded all the believers in Christ as plants which need growth&mdash;3:6-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In verse 1 Paul refers to the believers at Corinth as infants in Christ; their need was to grow in life to maturity, to be full-grown&mdash;2:6; Col. 1:28.</li>
	<li>The reason for division and lack of building is that the believers remain in their natural life and natural being&mdash;1 Cor. 1:12-13; 3:3-4; 2:14.</li>
	<li>The Corinthians, who were still infants with respect to the initial gifts, desperately needed to grow&mdash;3:2; 1:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Corinthians exhibited three signs of infancy:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Being unable to receive solid food but only milk&mdash;3:2.</li>
			<li>Being full of jealousy and strife and walking according to man&mdash;1:11; 3:3.</li>
			<li>Exalting spiritual giants to cause divisions&mdash; 1:12; 3:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The initial gifts&mdash;the divine life and the Holy Spirit (Rom. 6:23; Acts 2:38; Heb. 6:4)&mdash;are the seed sown into us (Mark 4:26); now these gifts need to be developed and cultivated:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In 1 Corinthians Paul is seeking to develop and cultivate the initial gifts received by the believers.</li>
			<li>What we need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and what the Lord is seeking among us, is more growth in life, more development of the initial gifts.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The life with which the believers grow in the church is the crucified and resurrected Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2; Col. 3:4.</li>
	<li>The growth in life is caused by God; as far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ are nothing, and God is everything&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6-7.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s desire is that our heart would be open to Him, soft toward Him, and longing for Him, and that we would draw near to Him, eat Him, drink Him, enjoy Him, and digest Him that daily we would grow with the growth of God&mdash;10:3-4; Col. 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jesus came as a Sower to sow God into us; we are the earth, the cultivated land, the farm, to grow Christ&mdash;Mark 4:3-4, 14; 1 Cor. 3:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s farm grows Christ, and Christ is for the building (v. 11); as Christians, we are growing Christ.</li>
	<li>When we grow properly, Christ will be produced in us; the issue of our growth will be Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:15; Col. 2:19; Gal. 4:19.</li>
	<li>The church is built with the Christ we experience and who is even the produce grown by us&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For the building up of the church, we must have the Christ who is produced through our growth in life.</li>
		<li>There can be no building without the growing of Christ as the material for God&rsquo;s building; as God&rsquo;s farm, we must grow in life to produce Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church is God&rsquo;s farm which produces gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;vv. 9, 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church, the temple of God, must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones produced from Christ&rsquo;s growing in us&mdash;vv. 16-17.</li>
	<li>First we have the growth on God&rsquo;s farm; then the plants on this farm become the precious materials for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;vv. 6-7, 12.</li>
	<li>Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God; these precious materials are the products of our enjoyment of Christ&mdash;v. 12; 15:45b; 6:17.</li>
	<li>The precious materials for God&rsquo;s building are related to the Triune God&mdash;to the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:12; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>We are becoming gold, silver, and precious stones for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In God the Father, we have His life and nature as the gold; in God the Son, we have His redemption as the silver; and in God the Spirit, we have transformation as the precious stones.</li>
		<li>In order to build with these materials, we ourselves must be constituted with them; we need to be constituted with the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation.</li>
		<li>We need the growth in the nature of God the Father, the redemption of God the Son, and the transformation of God the Spirit; this growth makes us gold, silver, and precious stones for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;vv. 12, 16-17.</li>
		<li>Through digestion, assimilation, and metabolism, Christ becomes us, and we become Him; then we become the precious materials for God&rsquo;s building&mdash; Eph. 3:17; Gal. 4:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal goal is the building&mdash;the temple built with precious materials on Christ as the unique foundation&mdash;1 Cor. 3:11-12, 16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The growth in the divine life produces precious materials for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation; this habitation, the church, is the increase, the enlargement, of the unlimited Christ&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22; John 3:29-34.</li>
	<li>First we have the farm for the growth in life; then we have the building for God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;1 Cor. 3:9; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:20-22; 4:16.</li>
	<li>The actual building of the church as the house of God is by the growth in life of the believers&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6-7, 16-17; Eph. 2:20-21; 1 Pet. 2:2-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>True building is the growth in life; the extent to which we have been built up is the extent to which we have grown.</li>

<h1 class="title">Being One Spirit with the Lord<br />
to Have the Highest Spirituality</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 6:17-20; 7:17-25, 40</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The essence of the New Testament is the two spirits&mdash; the divine Spirit and the human spirit&mdash;mingled together as one spirit&mdash;6:17; Rom. 8:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>joined</em> in 1 Corinthians 6:17 refers to the believers&rsquo; organic union with the Lord through believing into Him&mdash;John 3:15-16; 15:4-5.</li>
	<li>The expression <em>one spirit</em> indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The spirit, which is the mingling of our spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit into one spirit, is both the Spirit of the Lord and our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4; 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17.</li>
		<li>All of our spiritual experiences, such as our fellowship with the Lord, our prayer to Him, and our living with Him, are in this mingled spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The union of God and man is a union of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man (2:11-14); the union of these two spirits is the deepest mystery in the Bible.</li>
	<li>The focus of God&rsquo;s economy is the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit; whatever God intends to do or accomplish is related to this focus&mdash;Eph. 3:9, 5; 1:17; 2:22; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18.</li>
	<li>By being one spirit with the Lord, we can experience Him as the all-inclusive One&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2, 24, 30; 2:8, 10; 3:11; 5:7-8; 10:3-4; 11:3; 12:12; 15:20, 47, 45:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We enjoy Christ by being joined to Him as one spirit.</li>
		<li>We can experience Christ and take Christ as everything because we have become one spirit with Him.</li>
		<li>When we are one spirit with the Lord, we enjoy the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord&mdash;1:9.</li>
		<li>For everyone who is one spirit with the Lord, the supply is inexhaustible.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The spirit of faith (2 Cor. 4:13) is the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit; we should exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak the things that we have experienced of the Lord.</li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16), and our spirit is within our body; hence, our body becomes a temple of the Holy Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 6:19-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our organic union with the Lord makes it possible for our bodies to be members of Christ&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		<li>Because we are organically united with Christ and because Christ dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and makes His home in our heart (Eph. 3:17), our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Christ.</li>
		<li>We urgently need to see the vision that our bodies are members of Christ, that we are one spirit with the Lord, and that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 6:15, 17, 19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The mingled spirit is a spirit that is one spirit with God and that is the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead&mdash;1 John 5:11; 2 Pet. 1:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The divine Spirit and the human spirit are mingled as one within us so that we can live the life of a God-man, a life that is God yet man and man yet God&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
		<li>The God-man living is the living of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man joined and mingled together as one.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>First Corinthians 7 conveys the spirit of a person who loves the Lord, who cares for the Lord&rsquo;s interests on earth, who is absolutely for the Lord and one with the Lord, and who in every respect is obedient, submissive, and satisfied with God and the circumstances arranged by Him:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul was absolutely one with God, and he wanted the Corinthian believers to be one with Him and not to initiate anything&mdash;vv. 17-24.</li>
	<li>Because Paul was utterly one with the Lord, in his instructions and answers he spontaneously and unconsciously expressed an absolute spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul had an excellent spirit, a spirit that was submissive, content, and satisfied:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In his spirit he was very submissive and content with his situation.</li>
			<li>To him, every situation was of the Lord, and he would not initiate anything to change it.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Because Paul had such a spirit, he could answer the Corinthians in a way that would help them also to become one with God in their situation&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Because Paul was one with the Lord, when he spoke, the Lord spoke with him; thus, in 1 Corinthians 7 we have an example of the New Testament principle of incarnation&mdash;vv. 10, 12, 25, 40:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The principle of incarnation is that God enters into man and mingles Himself with man to make man one with Himself; thus, God is in man and man is in God&mdash;John 15:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him and speak together with Him; thus, His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word.</li>
		<li>The Old Testament principle of speaking for God was &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord&rdquo; (Isa. 10:24; Jer. 2:2); the New Testament principle of incarnation is &ldquo;I [the speaker] charge,&rdquo; for the speaker and the Lord are one.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 7 in the principle of incarnation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The principle in verse 10 is the same as that in Galatians 2:20: the principle of incarnation&mdash;two persons living as one person.</li>
		<li>Because Paul was one with the Lord, he knew the Lord&rsquo;s heart and mind.</li>
		<li>Paul was one with the Lord to such a degree that when he gave his own opinion, he thought that he also had the Spirit of God&mdash;1 Cor. 7:40.</li>
		<li>In verses 25 and 40 we see the highest spirituality&mdash;the spirituality of a person who is so one with the Lord and permeated with Him that even his opinion expresses the Lord&rsquo;s mind.</li>
		<li>If we are saturated with the Spirit, what we express will be our thought, but it will also be something of the Lord because we are one with Him&mdash; 6:17.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Christian life is a race that we must run successfully to obtain the prize, the kingdom reward&mdash; 9:24; Heb. 12:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul began to run the heavenly race after the Lord took possession of him, and he continually ran that he might finish it&mdash;1 Cor. 9:24-27; Phil. 3:12-14; Acts 20:24.</li>
	<li>At the end Paul triumphantly proclaimed, &ldquo;I have finished the course,&rdquo; and for this he received from the Lord a reward&mdash;the crown of righteousness&mdash;2 Tim. 4:6-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The incorruptible crown, the crown of righteousness, which the Lord will award to His overcoming saints who win the race, is a reward in addition to salvation; in contrast to the salvation which is of grace and by faith (Eph. 2:5, 8-9), this prize is of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10).</li>
		<li>Whether we will be rewarded by Him depends upon how we run the race; in view of this prize the apostle charged the Corinthian believers to run the race that they might obtain the reward&mdash;1 Cor. 9:24.</li>
		<li>The uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom will be a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race&mdash;Phil. 3:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul was very much on the alert to run his course by subduing his body to serve his holy purpose, that he might not be disapproved and rejected at the judgment seat of Christ and be found unworthy of the reward of the kingdom&mdash;1 Cor. 9:24-27; Matt. 7:21-23; 25:11-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to subdue our body and make it a conquered captive to serve us as a slave for fulfilling our holy purpose.</li>
		<li>This is equivalent to putting to death our earthly members (Col. 3:5) and putting to death the practices of the body (Rom. 8:13), not allowing our body to be used for the indulgence of lust or doing anything on our own except what is holy to God&mdash;1 Cor. 6:19-20; 10:31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to be encouraged and warned by the type of the children of Israel, whose journey toward the good land typifies the Christian race toward our good land, the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;vv. 1-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although we have been redeemed through Christ, delivered out of Satan&rsquo;s bondage, and brought into the revelation of God&rsquo;s economy, we may yet fail to reach the goal of God&rsquo;s calling, that is, to enter into the possession of our good land, Christ (Phil. 3:12-14), and enjoy His riches for the kingdom of God that we may be His expression in the present age and participate in the fullest enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom age (Matt. 25:21, 23).</li>
		<li>We need to run with endurance the race which is set before us, looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith&mdash;Heb. 12:1-2a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to receive the kingdom reward, we must take heed how we build the church, that is, with what materials we build the church&mdash;1 Cor. 3:10-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we build with gold (God&rsquo;s nature), silver (Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work), and precious stones (the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work), we will receive a reward&mdash; vv. 12, 14.</li>
		<li>If we build with wood (human nature), grass (man in the flesh), and stubble (lifelessness), we will be saved, yet so as through fire&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		<li>To build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble is to corrupt, ruin, defile, mar, and destroy the temple of God&mdash;v. 17.</li>
		<li>All those who have corrupted, ruined, defiled, and marred the church of God by their heretical doctrines, divisive teachings, worldly ways, and natural efforts in building will suffer God&rsquo;s punishment; since the temple of God, the church, is holy, the materials, the ways, and the efforts by which we build it also must be holy.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s fellow workers, working together with Him (John 5:17; 1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 6:1), we must be faithful stewards of the mysteries of God (1 Cor. 4:1-2; 7:25; 9:17; 1 Pet. 4:10; cf. Num. 18:1):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The initiation of God&rsquo;s work must be out of God and not out of us&mdash;Rom. 11:36.</li>
			<li>The advance of God&rsquo;s work must be by God&rsquo;s power and not by our power&mdash;Acts 1:8; Zech. 4:6.</li>
			<li>The result of God&rsquo;s work must be for God&rsquo;s glory and not for our glory&mdash;John 7:18; Eph. 3:21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to honor the headship of Christ and of God in the divine government&mdash;&ldquo;I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ&rdquo;&mdash; 1 Cor. 11:3; cf. 15:22-28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Here the headship of Christ over every man is related to individuals; Christ is the Head of the Body, the church (Eph. 5:23), corporately, and of the believers individually.</li>
	<li>Trying to assume headship without first coming under God&rsquo;s headship was the cause of the fall of the angels; we want to testify to the rebellious angels that we accept Christ as our Head&mdash;Isa. 14:12-15; 1 Cor. 11:2-3, 10.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s goal is to appoint Christ as the Head so that every man would submit to Him; we must be a people under God&rsquo;s headship, reflecting through our own submission to Christ His own submission to God&mdash;Eph. 1:10; 1 Cor. 11:10.</li>
	<li>Christ, the Son of God, as the Head of mankind in His humanity, is under the headship of God the Father for the government of God&rsquo;s kingdom:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>After God the Father has subjected all things under the feet of Christ as a resurrected man in glory (Eph. 1:22; Heb. 2:7-8), and after Christ as such a resurrected man has put all enemies under His feet to execute God the Father&rsquo;s subjection of all things to Him, He as the Son of God, along with His delivering of the kingdom back to God the Father, will also subject Himself in His divinity to God, who has subjected all things to Him, the Son in His humanity&mdash;1 Cor. 15:24-28.</li>
		<li>This indicates the Son&rsquo;s absolute subjection and subordination to the Father, which exalts the Father that God the Father may be all in all.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The record regarding spiritual eating in the Bible is a strong indication that God intends to dispense Himself into us by the way of eating&mdash;Gen. 2:9, 16-17; Exo. 12:1-11; 16:14-15; Deut. 8:7-10; Rev. 2:7, 17; 3:20; 22:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To eat is to contact things outside of us and to receive them into us, with the result that they eventually become our constitution&mdash;Gen. 2:16-17.</li>
	<li>Food is anything we take into us for our satisfaction; whatever we desire, hunger, and thirst after is the diet according to which our being has been constituted&mdash; Job 23:12b; Jer. 15:16; Num. 11:4-6.</li>
	<li>What a person eats gets into him and causes him to become an expression of that thing; this is based on the principle that eating is a fellowship, a participation&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16, 21.</li>
	<li>Eating is the way to experience God&rsquo;s dispensing and to be mingled with Him for His expression&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:9.</li>
	<li>We are what we eat; therefore, if we eat God as our food, we will be one with God and even become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;John 6:32-33, 35, 41, 48, 50-51.</li>
	<li>We live according to that with which we are occupied and saturated; if we eat Christ and are saturated with Him as the life-giving Spirit, we shall live Christ&mdash; v. 57; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
	<li>The entire Christian life should be a feast, an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet&mdash;1 Cor. 5:7-8; 10:16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should all eat the same spiritual food, not eating anything other than the Lord or enjoying anything in place of the Lord&mdash;vv. 3-4.</li>
		<li>Eating is related to enjoyment; if our enjoyment is something other than Christ, then in the sight of God that enjoyment is idolatry&mdash;vv. 7, 14, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The emphasis of the Lord&rsquo;s table is the fellowship of His blood and body, the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship&mdash;vv. 16-17, 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord has given Himself to us that we may partake of Him and enjoy Him by eating and drinking Him:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The One who presents His body and blood to us is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
		<li>This wonderful Christ is everything to us for our enjoyment; all that He is, is for our participation and enjoyment.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Fellowship</em> here refers to the believers&rsquo; communion in the joint participation in the blood and body of Christ.</li>
		<li>The fellowship makes us, the participants in the Lord&rsquo;s blood and body, not only one with one another but also one with the Lord; we make ourselves identified with the Lord in the fellowship of His blood and body.</li>
		<li>In 1:9 the fellowship is the fellowship of the Son of God; in 10:16 the fellowship is the fellowship of His blood and body, indicating that He has been processed for our enjoyment.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body, for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo;&mdash;v. 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are all one Body because we all partake of the one bread; our joint partaking of the one bread makes us all one.</li>
		<li>Our partaking of Christ makes us all His one Body; the very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us His one Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The table with the body and blood of Christ is the reality of Christ as the good land; whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to enjoy Him as the all-inclusive One, in our experience we are in the good land enjoying the riches of the land.</li>
	<li>Our participation in the Lord&rsquo;s table must be in the unique fellowship of His unique Body, without any division either in practice or in spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The emphasis of the Lord&rsquo;s supper is the remembrance of the Lord&mdash;11:24-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>At the Lord&rsquo;s table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord&rsquo;s supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment.</li>
	<li>Regarding the Lord&rsquo;s table and the Lord&rsquo;s supper, there is mutuality; the Lord&rsquo;s table is for our enjoyment, and the Lord&rsquo;s supper is for His enjoyment.</li>
	<li>The word <em>unto</em> in verses 24 and 25 implies a result&mdash;a continual remembrance of the Lord for His satisfaction.</li>
	<li>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup&mdash;vv. 24-25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The bread is of life, and the cup is of blessing&mdash; John 6:35; 1 Cor. 10:16.</li>
		<li>To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, our life and blessing; this is to remember Him in a genuine way.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes&rdquo;&mdash;11:26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To take the Lord&rsquo;s supper is not to remember the Lord&rsquo;s death but to declare and display it.</li>
		<li>We should take the Lord&rsquo;s supper unto the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death until He comes back to set up God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash; Matt. 26:29.</li>
		<li>When we eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper with a view to a continual remembrance of Him in His first and second comings, that supper becomes a satisfaction to Him in relation to the kingdom, God&rsquo;s administration.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In taking the Lord&rsquo;s supper we must discern the Body to determine whether the bread on the table represents the unique mystical Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 11:29.</li>
	<li>Eating the Lord&rsquo;s supper should remind us to live a life in the church to bring in the kingdom for the satisfaction of the Lord Jesus&mdash;v. 26; Matt. 26:29.</li>

the Means of the Divine Administration</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:12-27</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The apostle&rsquo;s dealing with head covering concerns the Head; his dealing with the Lord&rsquo;s supper (the Lord&rsquo;s table) concerns the Body&mdash;11:3, 17-34:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Regarding the headship of Christ, which represents God and is represented by man, we must keep the divine governmental order ordained by God, without any disorder.</li>
	<li>Regarding the Body of Christ, we must be properly regulated by the apostle&rsquo;s instruction, without any confusion or division.</li>
	<li>The Head is Christ, and the Body is the church (v. 3; 1:2; 12:27); these two&mdash;Christ and the church&mdash;are the controlling and directing factors of the apostle&rsquo;s dealing with the confused and disorderly church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In chapters one through ten Paul deals with the church&rsquo;s problems first by stressing Christ as God&rsquo;s center and our portion.</li>
		<li>In chapters eleven through sixteen he emphasizes the church as God&rsquo;s goal and our concern.</li>
		<li>Both Christ and the church are crucial to the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration in His New Testament economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The unique mystical Body of Christ is the means for God to carry out His administration&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:12-13, 25, 27; 11:29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The mystical Body of Christ is thoroughly and absolutely related to God&rsquo;s administration; apart from the mystical Body of Christ, God has no means, no way, to carry out His administration.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have a group of saved and regenerated people who have become one to be an organic Body to carry out His administration&mdash;Eph. 3:10-11; 4:16; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:12-13, 27.</li>
	<li>The mystical Body of Christ, the church, is for Christ&rsquo;s move on earth; the Head is now operating God&rsquo;s administration through the Body&mdash;11:3; 12:12.</li>
	<li>Divisions damage the mystical Body of Christ with respect to the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration&mdash; 1:2, 10-13; 12:25, 27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Satan&rsquo;s subtle device is to cut the Body into pieces.</li>
		<li>For centuries God has not been able to carry out His administration because the unique means for this&mdash;the mystical Body of Christ&mdash;has been cut into pieces through division.</li>
		<li>Because we realize that the carrying out of the divine administration requires the unique Body, the mystical Body, we hate division and are absolutely opposed to it&mdash;1:10; 12:25; Acts 20:30; Rom. 16:17-18; Titus 3:10.</li>
		<li>In order that God&rsquo;s administration may be carried out, we must care for the oneness of the unique mystical Body of Christ (Eph. 4:3, 13; John 17:21-23); having such a concern will preserve us in the Body and keep us from any division.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We take care of God&rsquo;s administration by discerning the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 11:29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To discern the Body is first to realize that Christ has only one mystical Body.</li>
		<li>If we have the proper understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, we shall not be divided by anything; rather, we shall remain in the unique mystical Body of Christ, the means for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of the divine administration.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Body of Christ is the corporate Christ&mdash;12:12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In verse 12 <em>the Christ</em> refers not to the individual Christ but to the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The corporate Christ is composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as His members.</li>
		<li>All the believers in Christ are organically united with Him (Rom. 12:4-5) and constituted with His life and element (Col. 3:4, 11) and have thus become His Body, an organism to express Him; hence, Christ is not only the Head but also the Body.</li>
		<li>The Bible considers Christ and the church as one mysterious Christ&mdash;Acts 9:4-5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is the Head of this mysterious Christ, and the church is the Body of this mysterious Christ; the two have been joined to become the one mysterious Christ&mdash;Eph. 5:32.</li>
			<li>All the saved ones in all times and all space added together become the Body of this mysterious Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because the reality of Christ is the Spirit, the way to be constituted with Christ to be His Body is to drink the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink one Spirit.</li>
		<li>By drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Blending is the most helpful thing in keeping the oneness of the Body&mdash;vv. 24-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The universal Body of Christ is a blending of all the local churches in the divine life&mdash;Col. 4:15-16; Rev. 1:4, 11; 2:7a.</li>
	<li>The goal of the universal blending is the reality of the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>Blending requires us to be crossed out and be by the Spirit to dispense Christ and do everything for the sake of His Body.</li>
	<li>Blending means that we should always stop to fellowship with others; to have fellowship is to put away our private interests and join with others for a common purpose&mdash;the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 John 1:3; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>In the spiritual element all the churches should be blended together as one.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The one Body is the one church of God, manifested in many localities as many local churches&mdash;Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 10:32b; 1:2; 12:27; Rev. 1:4, 11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The local churches are many in existence but are still one Body universally in element&mdash;Eph. 4:4.</li>
	<li>All the local churches are and should be one Body universally, doctrinally, and practically&mdash;1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33; 16:1.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 8:1; 12:31b&mdash;14:1; 16:24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Love is the most excellent way for the building up of the church, and prophesying is the excelling gift for the building up of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 8:1; 12:31b&mdash; 14:1, 4b, 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s ultimate concern is the building up of the church, which is the primary thing in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Matt. 16:18.</li>
	<li>To take the way of love and to prophesy (to speak the Lord into others) are to enter into the contents of God&rsquo;s entire New Testament economy, which is Christ as the Son of Man cherishing us and as the Son of God nourishing us&mdash;Eph. 5:29.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Love is the most excellent way to use the gifts, the way to be in the Body, and the way to be for the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 12:31b&mdash;13:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is love; we love because He first loved us&mdash;1 John 4:8, 19.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s predestination of us unto the divine sonship was motivated by the divine love&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s giving of His only begotten Son to us that we may be saved from perdition judicially through His death and have the eternal life organically in His resurrection was motivated by the divine love&mdash;John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-10.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s love motivates us, His children, to love our enemies that we may be perfect as He is; He loves the fallen human race, who became His enemies, by causing His sun (signifying Christ) to rise on the evil and the good indiscriminately and by sending rain (signifying the Spirit) on the just and the unjust equally; thus, we may become the sons of the heavenly Father who are sanctified from the tax collectors and the Gentiles&mdash;Matt. 5:43-48.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 8:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The outward, objective knowledge that puffs up comes from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the source of death.</li>
		<li>The spiritual, not fleshly, love, which is an expression of life as described in 1 Corinthians 13, builds up; it comes from the tree of life, the source of life.</li>
		<li>This is the love of God (1 John 4:16) infused into us by faith, which has brought us into the organic union with God.</li>
		<li>By this love we love God (1 Cor. 8:3) and the brothers (1 John 4:21), and according to this love we should walk (Rom. 14:15); thus, our walk builds up (1 Cor. 10:23).</li>
		<li>This building up refers not only to the edification of individual believers but also to the building up of the corporate Body of Christ&mdash;14:4-5, 12; 3:9-10, 12; 10:23; Eph. 4:16.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;If anyone loves God, this one is known by Him&rdquo;&mdash; 1 Cor. 8:3:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Loving God is the base of our Christian life; it must be spiritual, not fleshly, although it requires the exercise of man&rsquo;s entire being&mdash; Mark 12:30; cf. 1 Cor. 16:22:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Our loving God makes us those who are blessed of God to share the divine blessings that He has ordained and prepared for us (Christ as the depths of God), which are beyond our apprehension&mdash;2:9-10.</li>
				<li>2) Our not loving the Lord makes us those who are accursed, set apart to a curse&mdash;16:22.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>To be known by God is to be owned and possessed by Him as His treasure; the one who is known by God becomes God&rsquo;s possession, joy, entertainment, and pleasure&mdash;cf. Col. 1:10.</li>
			<li>To say that God does not know you means that He does not approve of your way&mdash;Matt. 7:22-23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not puffed up; it does not behave unbecomingly and does not seek its own things; it is not provoked and does not take account of evil; it does not rejoice because of unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; it covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never falls away&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 13:4-8a.</li>
	<li>Love is the conclusion of all spiritual virtues and the factor of fruit-bearing that supplies us bountifully with the rich entrance into the kingdom of Christ&mdash; 2 Pet. 1:5-11.</li>
	<li>The Body of Christ builds itself up in love&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>The spirit that God gives us is of love; hence, it is of power and sobermindedness&mdash;2 Tim. 1:7.</li>
	<li>He who does not love abides in death&mdash;1 John 3:14b.</li>
	<li>We must pursue love while we desire spiritual gifts&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:1.</li>
	<li>To overcome the degradation of the church we need to pursue love with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22.</li>
	<li>Loving one another is a sign that we belong to Christ&mdash; John 13:34-35.</li>
	<li>The love of God makes us more than conquerors over our circumstantial situations&mdash;Rom. 8:35-39.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The genuine love is the issue of the enjoyment of God in His divine nature&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine nature is what God is; God is Spirit (John 4:24), love (1 John 4:8, 16), and light (1:5); Spirit is the nature of God&rsquo;s person, love is the nature of God&rsquo;s essence, and light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression.</li>
	<li>We can enjoy God as love in our fellowship with Him&mdash;vv. 2-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we remain in the divine fellowship to enjoy what God is as love in His essence, we will be bathed in the love of God; we will not only become a man of love, but we will become love itself.</li>
		<li>This love should saturate us until it becomes the love with which we love the brothers; the Lord desires a church of such brotherly love&mdash;Rev. 3:7a.</li>
		<li>Paul ends 1 Corinthians with a word of the assurance of love; this is not a natural love but love in Christ, love in resurrection (4:21), the love of God that becomes ours through the grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit&mdash;16:24; 2 Cor. 13:14.</li>

	<li>Prophesying is to speak to men building up for the church, encouragement for the believers, and consolation for the saints&rsquo; spiritual welfare&mdash;v. 3; cf. 3:12.</li>

	<li>Prophesying is for the building up of the church, which is the organism of the Triune God, in the way of life&mdash;vv. 4-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s desire is for all of His saints to prophesy&mdash; Num. 11:29; 1 Cor. 14:31.</li>
<li>Prophesying is the excelling gift among all the gifts, making its seekers excelling&mdash;v. 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in revealing God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way, and God&rsquo;s economy to His people&mdash;cf. 12:8.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in convicting people, exposing people&rsquo;s real condition, and showing people their spiritual need.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in speaking forth Christ to minister and dispense Christ to people for their nourishment.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in building up the church in the organic way that it may be built up as the organism of the processed Triune God for His fullness, His expression.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All the believers have the capacity, the ability, to prophesy, and all have the obligation to prophesy&mdash; 14:31, 24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The capacity to prophesy is in the divine life, which the believers possess and enjoy and which needs to increase within them so that this capacity may be developed unto their ability&mdash;Col. 2:19; cf. 2 Tim. 4:5.</li>
	<li>The obligation to prophesy is the fulfillment of our spiritual service, in which we are indebted to God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;Rom. 1:14-15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All the believers have been charged by the apostle to pursue, to seek, and to desire earnestly to prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:1, 12, 39a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are enabled to prophesy by learning (v. 31) in the Word of God, in the growth of life, and in our contact with God&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16-17; 1 Thes. 5:17-20; Gal. 5:16, 25:

		<li>We need to be revived every morning&mdash;Prov. 4:18; Lam. 3:22-24; Psa. 119:147-148.</li>
		<li>We need to live an overcoming life every day by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name in every place and living in the index of His eyes&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 12:3b; 2 Cor. 2:10.</li>
		<li>To live an overcoming life is to live a prophesying life by loving the Lord to the uttermost (1 Cor. 2:9), fellowshipping with Him moment by moment (cf. 1 John 1:6), walking according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4b), and speaking the word of the Lord in season and out of season (2 Tim. 4:2a).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We are enabled to prophesy by being perfected by the prophets&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>In order to practice 1 Corinthians 14, there is the need for the highest meetings of the church, meetings in which &ldquo;each one has&rdquo;&mdash;v. 26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The proper church meeting is a &ldquo;one another&rdquo; meeting, a &ldquo;round table&rdquo; meeting, in which we speak to one another (Eph. 5:19), teach and admonish one another (Col. 3:16), consider one another and exhort one another (Heb. 10:24-25), and listen to one another (1 Thes. 5:20).</li>
	<li>The proper church meeting makes the believers living by developing their organic ability and function&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>Before coming to the meeting, we should prepare ourselves for the meeting through our experience of the Lord or through our enjoyment of His word and fellowship with Him in prayer.</li>
	<li>After coming into the meeting, we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have prepared to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit&mdash;their enlightenment, nourishing, and building up.</li>
	<li>We must labor on Christ, our good land, so that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting and offer to God&mdash;Deut. 16:16.</li>
	<li>Thus, the meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and will be a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.</li>

<li>We must speak with the three constituting elements of prophesying:

	<li>We must have a vision concerning God&rsquo;s interest and economy, concerning the church as the Body of Christ, concerning the local churches, concerning the world, concerning the individual saints, and even concerning ourselves&mdash;the view through the enlightening of the divine light&mdash;Eph. 1:17; 1 Cor. 2:11-12.</li>
	<li>We speak what we see with the living words of this life under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and with His enlightenment&mdash;Acts 5:20.</li>
	<li>For the sake of the building up of the church, we need to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord by letting His word dwell in us richly&mdash;Col. 3:16; cf. 1 Tim. 6:20.</li>

Phil. 1:19; Exo. 30:23-25</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul dealt with the Corinthians&rsquo; heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead; we must see that resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy&mdash;v. 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The three major items of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection are the birth of the firstborn Son of God, the regeneration of the many sons of God, and Christ as the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit; the entire economy of God is carried out by these three items&mdash;Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:45b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The firstborn Son of God is the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18), the many sons of God are the members of the Body (John 12:24; Rom. 8:29), and the life-giving Spirit is the reality and life of the Body (John 14:17; Eph. 4:4).</li>
		<li>Without these major items of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, there would be no church, no Body of Christ, and there would be no economy of God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not of the living&mdash;Matt. 22:32.</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead; He would be a dead Savior, not a living One who lives forever (Rev. 1:18) and is able to save to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25).</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of our being justified by His death (Rom. 4:25), no imparting of life (John 12:24), no regeneration (3:5), no renewing (Titus 3:5), no transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), and no conformity to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29).</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ (12:5), no Body of Christ as His fullness (Eph. 1:20-23), and no church as Christ&rsquo;s bride (John 3:29), and therefore no new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11).</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God&rsquo;s eternal purpose would be nullified.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In incarnation Christ became flesh for redemption (John 1:14, 29); then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the impartation of life to make us men of life (10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through and in His resurrection, Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers to flow out as rivers of living water&mdash;John 7:37-39; Rev. 21:6; 22:17.</li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, comprising all the elements of Jesus&rsquo; humanity with His death and Christ&rsquo;s divinity with His resurrection, which become the bountiful supply of the unsearchable Christ for the support of His believers&mdash;Phil. 1:19b.</li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit, typified by the compound anointing ointment with its ingredients&mdash;Exo. 30:23-25; 1 John 2:20, 27:

			<li>The Spirit leads us to the cross, the cross is applied by the Spirit, and the cross issues in more abundance of the Spirit&mdash;Heb. 9:14; Rom. 6:3, 6; 8:13-14; Gal. 2:20; John 12:24.</li>
			</ol></li>

			<li>We are conformed to the death of Christ by our outward, consuming environment in cooperation with the indwelling, crucifying Spirit&mdash; 2 Cor. 4:10-11, 16; Rom. 8:13-14; Gal. 5:24; Col. 3:5; Gal. 6:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Calamus signifies the precious resurrection of Christ:

			<li>We need to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in the life-giving Spirit as the all-sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 12:9-10; 1 Cor. 15:10, 45b, 58; Phil. 4:23.</li>

		</ol></li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is the Lord Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, for the metabolic transformation of the believers and for the growth and building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17-18; 1 Cor. 3:6, 9b, 12a; Eph. 4:16b.</li>
	<li>Without Christ being the life-giving Spirit, we cannot experience anything of God in His economy&mdash;1 John 5:6; John 16:13; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2:10; 6:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection&mdash;15:10, 45b:

<li>Although the material things were created by God and belong to Him (1 Chron. 29:14, 16), they have been corrupted by man&rsquo;s fall and usurped by Satan, the evil one (1 John 5:19); hence, they belong to fallen man and are unrighteous&mdash;Luke 16:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man fell into the darkness of acknowledging only material riches and not God, of trusting only in material riches and not in God, and even of serving material riches, taking them as God and allowing them to replace God&mdash;1 Tim. 6:17.</li>
	<li>To us who believe in the Lord Jesus, the earthly things which are necessary for human existence may simply be earthly things or they may become the world, a system of Satan&mdash;1 John 2:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 6:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Mammon</em> is an Aramaic word signifying wealth, riches.</li>
	<li>Mammon stands in opposition to God, indicating that wealth, or riches, is the opponent of God, robbing God&rsquo;s people of their service to Him.</li>
	<li>To serve the Lord requires us to love Him, giving our heart to Him, and requires us to cleave to Him, giving our entire being to Him&mdash;Luke 16:13:

		<li>In this way we are released from being occupied and usurped by mammon, that we may serve the Lord wholly and fully.</li>
		<li>In Luke 16:13 the Lord emphasizes that to serve Him we must overcome the enticing, deceitful mammon of unrighteousness&mdash;v. 9; Matt. 13:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The dealing with mammon and material possessions is related to God&rsquo;s administration among the churches in resurrection&mdash;1 Cor. 16:1-3:

	<li>If we know resurrection life and the resurrection power, we shall overcome money and material possessions; they will have no power over us, and they will not occupy or possess us&mdash;Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35:

		<li>Money or material possessions will not hinder or frustrate our function in the Body.</li>
		<li>What we have will be used for God&rsquo;s administration among the churches&mdash;1 Cor. 16:1, 3; Rom. 15:26.</li>
		<li>If this is our situation, the Lord God will have a way to carry out His administration among us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul opens 1 Corinthians 16 with a word about collecting material gifts on the first day of the week&mdash;vv. 1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first day of the week signifies resurrection, for it is the day of resurrection&mdash;John 20:1; Rev. 1:10.</li>
		<li>The fact that material things are offered on the first day of the week indicates that they should be offered in resurrection, not in our natural life&mdash; Matt. 6:1-4.</li>
		<li>Giving money and material things in resurrection is a strong indication that we are under God&rsquo;s administration in resurrection and have overcome the possession of material riches.</li>

<li>All the material riches and enjoyment in our living are supplied by God&rsquo;s rich giving; hence, we must not set our hope on the uncertainty of deceitful riches but on God, who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment&mdash;1 Tim. 6:17-19; Matt. 13:22.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus charges us to store up treasures in heaven, that is, to spend our riches on the heavenly Father by doing things such as giving to the poor (Matt. 19:21) and caring for the needy saints (Acts 2:45; 4:34-35; 11:29; Rom. 15:26) and the Lord&rsquo;s servants (Phil. 4:16-17)&mdash;Matt. 6:19-21.</li>
<li>To make friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness is to use money to do things to help others according to God&rsquo;s leading&mdash;Luke 16:9.</li>
<li>If we are willing to distribute our material wealth to help the needy for the sake of God, He will give into our bosom that which is rich and plenteous, a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over; He will not give into our hands that which is scanty&mdash;6:38.</li>
<li>The best way to be blessed by God in material riches is to give, not to receive, just as the Lord Jesus did&mdash;Acts 20:35; 2 Cor. 8:9.</li>
<li>Supplying the saints with material riches is a fellowship which brings mutual grace to both the giver and the receiver&mdash;v. 4.</li>
<li>Offering material riches is like sowing; in offering these riches, we will reap little if we sow little and reap much if we sow much&mdash;9:6, 10.</li>
<li>The giving and receiving of material things is intimately related to the experience of Christ&mdash;Phil. 4:10-20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we give and receive in the fellowship of life, there will be a blossoming in life (v. 10), the sign that life is flourishing, that there is a normal circulation of life in the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>The fellowship in the matters of giving and receiving not only ministers life to all concerned but brings all the parties into the glory of God&mdash;v. 19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The word in Malachi 3:10 superabundantly displays the infinitely rich promise of God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In principle, this word to the Israelites applies also to the New Testament believers.</li>
	<li>If we fully offer to God what belongs to Him that the church may be richly supplied, God will open the windows of heaven for us and pour out a blessing to us, which there will not be enough room to contain.</li>
