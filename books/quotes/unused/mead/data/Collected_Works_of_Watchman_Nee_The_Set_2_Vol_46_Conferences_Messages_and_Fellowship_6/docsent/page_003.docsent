   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION SIXTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MISCELLANEOUS MESSAGES AND FELLOWSHIP CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY GOD'S CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE THINGS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:15-19; 2:6; Rom 8:32; John 6:35; 8:12; 11:25; 14:6; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the fullness dwells in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word fullness is simple yet very puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does the phrase the fullness of God mean?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must turn to the Old Testament for an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There God uses this word in a peculiar way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Psalms say, "The earth...and the fullness thereof" 24:1 , and "The sea and its fullness" 96:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The earth and the fullness mean the earth and the things of the earth; the sea and the fullness mean the sea and all the things in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ as the fullness of God means Christ is the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The things of God as His fullness dwell in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does Christ being the things of God mean?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We understand that Christ is a person, and we think that there are things of God apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are a thousand things, and there is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But no!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All things are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the things of God are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, "I am the bread."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not say He was the giver of the bread; He is the thing called bread.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said, "I am the light."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not say He is the giver of light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again He said, "I am the resurrection and the life."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the very thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We think of Christ as being a living person, but we also want to have some truth in addition to that.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He presented Himself not only as a person, as the Son of God, but also as the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the things of God are simply bits of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ as a person is the very things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For us to know more of God and to receive grace from Him in practical issues, Paul not only tried to lead us to see that Christ is a person, but he also said that Christ was "made sin" 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not say that Christ had borne our sins, or that He was our deliverer, but that Christ had become sin, that is, He became a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Christ became wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wisdom is itself a thing and it comprises three things: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This verse does not say that He was our Justifier; it says that He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse does not say that He is the Sanctifier; it says that He is made unto us sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It also does not say that Christ is our Redeemer; it says that He is made redemption unto us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of saying that He is a person, this verse says that He is these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What does all this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to our concept, God is a great Giver, a fountain, and His chief gift is His Son the greatest gift that heaven could have ever made.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we also see that we need grace, peace, righteousness, goodness, etc. We need many things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we come as those who are needy and ask for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our needs are all different, so we think that the supplies must also be different.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But this is not the way God works.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We make the mistake of seeking these things as things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We seek righteousness, as if we receive Christ and then later receive righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We seek sanctification, as if we receive Christ and then later receive sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if we have a vital relationship with the Lord, we get these things!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a most important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot have anything apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason we find so many occurrences of the phrase in Christ in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is always in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot receive anything apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to first get in touch with Christ and then we will receive the things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First Corinthians 1:30 says that Christ has been made righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The person becomes the thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all know that when we come before God, the question of righteousness arises.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not go out to visit someone, we do not think of our clothes!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We think of them only when we have to meet someone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only when we approach God does the question of what we appear in arise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The presence of God always produces a sense of the need of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our first thought is, "What have I done?" or "What have I not done?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our whole thought is on the thing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We wonder what we have to bring before God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Praise the Lord, our righteousness is not based on whether we have prayed, witnessed, or read our Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is our righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is a great thing to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>None of us could ever have true rest if this were not settled.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We could easily be put out of the battle, and we would have ups and downs all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we could only come to see that our righteousness is a person!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>My righteousness is not my patience, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>My patience may fail, but not my righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>My love may wane, but not my righteousness, for my righteousness is not in me but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If He does not change, then my righteousness will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We try to look for some thing within.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But we should not seek righteousness as a thing; we should seek Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Oh, to be delivered from things and to know Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is the things of God!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Unless this question is fundamentally settled, there will be no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No matter how much I have failed, my righteousness has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No matter how lofty a position I may have attained or how successful I may seem, my righteousness is still Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is always a danger of looking at our attainments instead of Christ, or feeling that we have arrived at something.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Someone may think that since he has not lost his temper, he can pray louder!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>No, it is not what we have or have not done; we do not stand on that ground but on the ground of the righteousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Christ is made unto us sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All righteousness has to do with God; that is, it is on the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But because we are walking on the earth, we also need something subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>How can we be meek, loving, and patient?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We try to look into ourselves to find what we need and then go to God with these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We think of our needs in terms of things, perhaps meekness or humility, and we pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We may pray a great deal and never get them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We think that we need a new part as if it were a question of parts and accessories!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>No, we need a new "car"!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We need the Lord Himself, not a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we seek patience we will never get it, but if we seek Christ we will get patience.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The person leads to the thing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we merely have patience, what we have belongs to the natural life and is not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>God does not dispense things.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God has only one answer to all of our difficulties His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God has only one remedy and that is His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>God does not give us power to be holy, but He lets His Son live His life of holiness in us and through us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Our life on earth has nothing to do with things, even divine things; our life has to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is not that we fight and try to resist, but that He does it all.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Whatever lack we have, we can trust Him to be the answer to that lack.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I cannot emphasize the word be too much.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When He is obeyed, trusted, and believed, we will find that Christ has been made unto us that very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>So, what need have we?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We may think that all our needs are different, but the fullness of Christ answers them all.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Christ is made unto us redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is looked upon as being something in the past, but the full effect of it will be manifested in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It will be manifested at our translation, or resurrection, at the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>How can we be raised?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Christ is our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>What does that mean?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It is Christ who is going to be taken up.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Something of Christ in us is going to be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I was once at the funeral of a brother, and there were two funerals going on at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I asked a bystander a question.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Pointing to our brother who had gone to be with the Lord, I said, "Do you know what we are doing to his body?"</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>"Burying him," the bystander answered.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>"Oh, no," I replied, "The man who is not a Christian is being buried."</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>"Then what are you doing with him?" he asked.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I said, "We are planting him."</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>There is a difference between burying and planting.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>With the latter there is something that will come up.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Nothing in us will survive death; only Christ will survive death.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>What makes it possible for us to come up?</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The Lord of life who cannot be held makes it possible.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Anything that does not come from heaven can never go into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Nothing of ourselves will ever be raised; only the Lord will be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Now we can see why Paul said, "To know Him" Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Hence, it is "Who will deliver me?"</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Rom 7:24 , not "What will deliver me?"</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>It is a question of who.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Our experience is not one of adding one experience of grace to another experience of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We grow, but we grow in the knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>This knowledge is the knowledge of Him as all the things.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Romans 8:32 says, "With Him freely give us all things."</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>All things are with Him because all things are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Blessed be the name of the Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Recorded by P.D.</S>
