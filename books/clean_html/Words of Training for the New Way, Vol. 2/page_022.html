<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">CONCERNING SOME PRACTICAL MATTERS</h1>
<p>This morning we want to spend some time to study further the things we should do in the present stage. At present, we have over eighty meetings in different districts in Taipei. We call them simply the &ldquo;district meetings.&rdquo; Hence, in the present stage, we have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR GROUPS OF PEOPLE TAKING THE LEAD<br />
TO FUNCTION IN THE DISTRICT MEETINGS</h2>
<p>First, we will consider the situation of the brothers and sisters, district by district. We also have to consider the distribution of the elders, the co-workers, and the full-time trainees. Then, we have to take a look at the home meetings established among the new believers in each district. According to the present arrangement, to have the church meetings and church services in the communities is a clear and accurate way. This is much more practical and suitable than the former arrangement of meeting and serving in the meeting halls.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Without Monopolizing or Replacing</h2>
<p>For the district meetings the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and the college students should all live in the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit in their daily living. When these four groups of people come to the meetings, they will spontaneously have something to supply others, be able to function, and be able to speak for the Lord. What I observed here last Lord&rsquo;s Day was quite good. I heard that the other districts were also quite good. The elders and co-workers all spoke in the meetings, and their speaking was fresh, high, living and rich. The full-timers and the college students were equally fresh in their speaking. This is a very good situation. But I hope you will be careful not to go to either extreme of not speaking at all or speaking too much. We should not give the other brothers and sisters an impression that we are monopolizing the meeting. In Taipei the elders, co-workers, full-time trainees, and college students make up about one quarter of the total number of attendants. It would, of course, be very good if this one quarter would function. But we must also remember that our functioning is only to take the lead, and not to replace the saints. If this quarter replaces the three quarters, this will become the old system again. Formerly, it was one speaking. Now it is a group speaking. This is still not what we are after.</p>
<p>We can encourage the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and college students to speak one by one in the meetings. Since we are just beginning to change the system, there is the need for you to take the lead to give the brothers and sisters an example and a model to follow. However, while you are doing this, do not replace the others. I am afraid that after hearing my word, you will not function at all next week in the district meeting. That would be what the Bible describes as, &ldquo;a cake not turned&rdquo; (Hosea 7:8). We as the cake must be turned repeatedly. So we still should speak in the district meetings, but we should not give others the feeling, &ldquo;These are the trained ones; we cannot match their speaking; we might as well let them speak.&rdquo; If they have such a feeling, that means we are dominating the meeting. We must guard against this danger. Therefore, I point this out from the beginning, that we are to take the lead, and not to replace others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Standing Against the Natural Self<br />
and Sisters Keeping a Proper Position</h2>
<p>Another thing, I have discovered is that, whether in the training meetings or in the church meetings, the young sisters are always stronger than the young brothers. I believe the main reason might be that the Bible calls the woman &ldquo;the weaker, female vessel&rdquo; (1 Pet. 3:7). As a result, the young sisters are unwilling to be considered weak. Hence, either they will not speak at all, or they will speak impressively at the first try. Actually, there is somewhat a feeling of inferiority with them. Also, by nature, males are inferior to females in singing and speaking. Girls also speak earlier than boys do. This may be one of the reasons for the sisters&rsquo; aggressiveness. Therefore, in the matter of speaking, we must stand against our natural self. Those who by nature want to speak should refrain from speaking, and those who by nature do not want to speak should speak. I am saying this to adjust you. I hope that you will not feel troubled. You must contribute your portion in a proper way.</p>
<p>The New Testament shows us that every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head (1 Cor. 11:5). This means that when speaking in the meetings, the sisters should not forget that they are still sisters. Some words, if spoken by brothers, will not sound strange. Even if they jump a little, that will not surprise others. But if the sisters, even though they are young, jump and speak in a wild way in the meetings, people will feel it is inappropriate. This is because in God&rsquo;s creation there is the distinction between male and female. I hope that the sisters would all function in the meetings. You have the riches, and these riches should be exhibited, the more the better. However, in functioning, do not forget that you are sisters.</p>
