   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We humble ourselves before You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, we admit that we are nothing and can do nothing.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In earlier messages on the apostles teaching, we have covered four main points concerning God s New Testament economy: the incarnation of the Triune God; the all-inclusive death of the incarnated Triune God, Jesus Christ; the resurrection of Christ; and the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the ascension of Christ, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit took place for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body, which is composed of many wonderful items.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, this wonderful Body is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, it is the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, it is the universal new man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All three of these items relate to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we will consider the church as it relates to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To Be the Household of God the Family of God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fourth item related to the Body is that it is the household of God, the family of God Eph 2:19; 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:6; 1 Pet 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The household of God is the family of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are the household of God, God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We believers are now a divine family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before we were saved, we were a human family, born of Adam, but now we are members of the divine family.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have a great Father, and we are His children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He considers all His children His household, His folks.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We, as God s children, constitute His family.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Greek, the same word is used to denote both house and household .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the English language also, the two words are treated as nearly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Chinese language is similar in that the word for home also refers to a family.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s house and God s household are one entity, not two separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may think of a home as being a house with a family living in it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With God, the family is the home and the home is the family.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s dwelling place is His children, and His children not only have been born by a natural birth, but also have been reborn by the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are born of God; we are not adopted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are children born directly of God into His family.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This family is a living entity and is God s home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God does not live in a home that is separate from His family.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He lives in His children, taking them as His home yet still considering them His children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we are both God s family and God s home.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We were constituted to be God s home two thousand years ago, either at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, or at the house of Cornelius in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was accomplished under the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body, which is the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are now such a household.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Though we are of different colors and races, we are folks of the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If this were not true, we could not call each other brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all have been born of the one Father in a great delivery John 16:19-22; 20:17; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul was born in the same delivery as you and I; thus, we all are of the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A household refers to life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without life there could be no family.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the book of Numbers, the numbering of the children of Israel was by their families, according to their fathers houses 1:2; 26:2 , indicating that it was according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the church life our first concern is with life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The life we are concerned with is not our forefather Adam s life, but God s life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have been born of the divine life and are today in a divine family.</S>
