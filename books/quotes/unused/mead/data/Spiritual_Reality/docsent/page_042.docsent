   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The principle of death and resurrection is to bring man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is incorrect, however, to say that a person who has passed through death and resurrection is absolutely devoid of the human element, having only the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person who has passed through death and resurrection is one who has been mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His human element has not been nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it has been mingled with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The incarnation of the Lord Jesus was God coming into man, God putting on man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He put on man, passed through death, and entered into resurrection, and in His death and resurrection He brought the man that He had put on into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then what is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Resurrection is the sphere or realm of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus died and resurrected, and through His death and resurrection He brought the man that He had put on into the realm of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need the light and the revelation of the Holy Spirit to see these matters of incarnation and of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our natural mind has no way to fully comprehend this matter of God coming into man and man coming into God, and our words are not adequate to express it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This mystery of God being man and man being God does not exist in our human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is beyond our human thought and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To see this matter requires the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE INCARNATION OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOD COMING TO BE A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While Jesus the Nazarene was living on the earth, did He live as a man or as God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible tells us that while the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He lived as a man, not as God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Gospels the Lord told people again and again who the Son of Man was Luke 6:5 and what the Son of Man had come for 9:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this He indicated that He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus rarely revealed His status as God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, He always lived out His condition as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only once, when He was transfigured on the mountain, did He fully manifest the condition of God within Him before the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Aside from that instance, we can say that He seldom revealed His condition as God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the thirty-three and a half years He was on the earth, He mostly lived out His condition as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was a man living on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, He lived out His humanity by His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was God living the life of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You and I are humans, and the life that we live is one hundred percent a human living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is a human living?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the means by which we live out our human living?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A human living is a living that a man lives out spontaneously and effortlessly by his humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, I am a Chinese, my nature is Chinese, and it is natural for me to have a Chinese living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not difficult at all for me to have a Chinese living according to the Chinese nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the life He lived was exactly the same as ours, except that He was without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, did He live by His humanity or by His divinity?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He lived a human life by His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most of us live out the human life by our humanity, but because He was God coming into man, our Lord lived a human life by His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, His living was apparently the same as that of Peter and John.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as Peter and John lived out the human life, so also the Lord Jesus lived out the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Outwardly speaking, they all lived the human life, but Peter and John lived the human life by man, while the Lord Jesus lived the human life by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They all lived the human life, but Peter and John lived a human life as men, and Jesus the Nazarene lived a human life as God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Peter and John s living, there was the flavor of man but not the flavor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The living of Jesus the Nazarene, however, was full of the flavor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Outwardly He had the form of man, but inwardly His content had the element, nature, and flavor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the Lord lived a human life on the earth, He spontaneously expressed His divinity and manifested His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why was this the case?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was because He was actually God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His divinity had been put into a man and was constrained, pressed, and confined by this man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was great, even infinitely great, but He limited His infinite greatness to a small man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, the life that the Lord lived on the earth was that of a man in appearance but was actually God in its content.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God was concealed in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He intentionally lived a human life by His divinity so that He might mingle His divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the principle of incarnation.</S>
