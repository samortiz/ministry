   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people can testify that this work has never stopped in them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They face one trial after another, encounter one incident after another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit has only one goal in all of His disciplining work: To break and dismantle the outer man so that the inner man can break forth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the trouble with us is that we murmur as soon as we suffer a little hardship, and we complain as soon as we suffer a little defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord has prepared a way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is ready to use us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as His hand is upon us, however, we become unhappy.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may or may not know it, but the Lord's goal is always to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The treasure is in the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who needs to see your earthen vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church lacks the treasure, not the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The world lacks the treasure, not the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the earthen vessel is not broken, who will find the treasure within?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord works in us in so many different ways for the purpose of breaking the earthen vessel, the alabaster flask, the outer shell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord wants to prepare a way to bring His blessing to the world through those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a way of blessing, but it is also a way stained with blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Blood must be shed, and wounds are unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How crucial the breaking of this outer man is!</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have to find out God's intention for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is unfortunate that many people do not know what the Lord is doing in them or what the Lord intends for them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May every one of us know the Lord's intention for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that everything that has happened to us throughout our lives is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord never does anything in vain.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord is trying to achieve one goal: To break and dismantle our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The trouble with many is that before the Lord is able to move even a finger, they show signs of displeasure already.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot ask for anything better; they are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If anyone goes to the Lord and says, "Lord, please let me choose the best," I believe the Lord will tell him, "I have given you the best.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What you are facing every day is for your highest good."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord has arranged everything for us for the purpose of breaking our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can put our spirit to full use only as our outer man is broken and our spirit is released.</S>
