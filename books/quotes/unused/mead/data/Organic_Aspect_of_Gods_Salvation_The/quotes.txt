[1]  CONTENTS The Complete Salvation of God Having Two Aspects The Judicial Aspect and the Organic Aspect Regeneration and Shepherding Dispositional Sanctification and Renewing Transformation and Building Up Conformation and Glorification
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD HAVING TWO ASPECTS THE JUDICIAL ASPECT AND THE ORGANIC ASPECT Scripture Reading: Rom 1:17a; 3:21-26; 9:30-31; Luke 24:47; Heb 1:3; Rom 5:10a; 1 Cor 1:2; Heb 13:12; Rom 1:17b; Acts 11:18; Rom 5:10b, 17b, 18b, 21b OUTLINE The judicial aspect of God's salvation: According to the righteousness of God Rom 1:17a; 3:21-26; 9:30-31.
[3]  For sinners to be forgiven before God Luke 24:47 , washed Heb 1:3 , justified Rom 3:24-25 , reconciled to God Rom 5:10a , and sanctified unto God positionally 1 Cor 1:2; Heb 13:12 , thereby entering into the grace of God for the accomplishment of the purpose of God's salvation.
[4]  God was willing to allow the highest angel created by Him Ezek.
[5]  In the aspect of purpose, that which God has carried out by His life organically is salvation, including 1 regeneration for us to receive the eternal life of God, 2 shepherding for us to grow and exist in the divine life, 3 sanctification in our disposition, 4 renewing in our mind, 5 transformation in our image, issuing in 6 God's building, 7 conformation to the image of God's firstborn Son, that is, maturity in the divine life, and 8 glorification, which is the consummation of God's eternal economy Rom 8:30 .
[6]  The processed Triune God and His regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified elect will be joined and mingled as one to constitute an organism as the enlargement and expression of God in eternity.
[7]  In the beginning of Genesis, when God created Adam, Adam was all alone without a counterpart.
[8]  Unfortunately, most of the believers through the generations have considered the redemption which God accomplished for us in procedure as the purpose of God's salvation, stressing the five items which God has accomplished for us in the aspect of redemption according to His righteousness judicially, while neglecting the eight items which God will do for us in the aspect of salvation through His life organically.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO REGENERATION AND SHEPHERDING Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 1 Pet 1:23; John 3:15, 36; Titus 3:5; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15; 1 Pet 2:2; John 21:15-17; Eph 4:12; 1 Pet 5:1, 4; John 14:6; 10:9-11, 14-16; 1 Pet 2:25; 5:4; Heb 13:20; Rev 7:16-17 OUTLINE In the propagation and nourishment of the divine life.
[10]  Regeneration: Regeneration being the center of God's entire salvation and the commencement of God's salvation in its organic aspect: It being to regenerate and re-create the believers in their spirit through the Spirit of God John 3:6b.
[11]  Prayer: O Lord, we thank You from our depths that we have been freed from all personal affairs and have been gathered into Your name, sitting here before You and listening to Your speaking.
[12]  These four portions show us that the purpose of God's loving us is that we may have His eternal life; that the Lord was lifted up on the cross as the brass serpent to deal with the old serpent, Satan, for the purpose also that we may have the eternal life of God; that we eat the Lord's flesh and drink the Lord's blood for us to be redeemed and to enjoy everything that the Lord Jesus has given to us in life all this is for us to have the eternal life of God; and, finally, that we believe into the Lord in order that we may have the eternal life of God.
[13]  THE FIVE ITEMS OF THE JUDICIAL REDEMPTION AND THE EIGHT ITEMS OF THE ORGANIC SALVATION OF GOD'S COMPLETE SALVATION
[14]  God is the eternal life, and He desires to come into us to be our life.
[15]  We have believed in the Lord, our sins have been forgiven, our sins have been washed away, we have been justified by God, we have been reconciled to God, and we have been separated, sanctified, unto God.
[16]  REGENERATION AND SHEPHERDING THE PROPAGATION AND NOURISHMENT OF THE DIVINE LIFE
[17]  He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" v. 4 . However, the regeneration which the Lord Jesus referred to was for one to be born of water that is, death and the Spirit that is, life v. 5 . Then the Lord went on to say, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" v. 6 . The first Spirit is the divine Spirit, referring to God.
[18]  For the Believers to Have the Spiritual Life of God
[19]  John 1:12-13 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
[20]  He is the Word from God 1:1 , and He is also the light from God v. 9 . When we receive Him, we have the authority to become children of God.
[21]  God gives us His life as our authority that we may become children of God.
[22]  One day Miss Peace Wang came to my hometown to preach the gospel.
[23]  In His organic salvation God the Father of the Divine Trinity first regenerates us by God the Spirit and then shepherds us in God the Son as our Shepherd that we may grow and exist in His life for eternity.
[24]  CHAPTER THREE DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION AND RENEWING Scripture Reading: Rom 15:16; 8:2; 6:19, 22; Eph 1:4; Rev 21:2, 10; 22:19; Rom 12:2a OUTLINE In the dispositional sanctification in the divine nature and in the Spirit's renewing of the believers' mind.
[25]  Dispositional sanctification: Dispositional sanctification being for the believers to be sanctified in their disposition that they may partake of the holy nature of God and be one with Him in this attribute of His Rom 15:16.
[26]  In the previous two messages we referred to the two aspects of God's complete salvation, the judicial aspect and the organic aspect.
[27]  However, it is not sufficient to be separated and made holy unto God positionally.
[28]  After we are sanctified positionally and reconciled to God, as we begin to pursue in life, we will sense something within us which is not our disposition but God's nature.
[29]  RENEWING The Believers Are Spontaneously Renewed in Their Spiritual Life When They Are Sanctified by the Holy Spirit
[30]  CHAPTER FOUR TRANSFORMATION AND BUILDING UP Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:16, 18; 4:16; Matt 16:13-18; John 1:51; 2:16-22; 14:23, 2; Rom 12:3-5; 1 Cor 1:10-13; 3:9-15; Gal 6:14-15; Eph 3:17; 4:4-6, 11-16; Rev 3:12-13; 4:3a; 21:2, 10-23; 22:1-5 OUTLINE In the metabolism in the divine life and in the joining and knitting in the building up.
[31]  Transformation: Transformation being not an outward change or correction, but the metabolic function of the life of God in the believers.
[32]  THE THREE STAGES OF CHRIST From Eternity Past into Time
[33]  We all know that the Lord Jesus as the eternal God is from eternity to eternity, yet with Him there is an aspect of three stages.
[34]  Becoming the Life-giving Spirit through His Resurrection from the Dead for the Fulfillment of the Organic Aspect of God's Salvation
[35]  The Believers Being Transformed into the Image of the Lord by Turning to the Lord and Beholding Him with an Unveiled Face
[36]  If we desire to have this kind of transformation, we must first remove the various kinds of veils of our old concepts by turning to the Lord 2 Cor 3:16 and by beholding Him with an unveiled face and reflecting His glory like a mirror v. 18 . The problem with the Jews was that they had a thick veil on their heart.
[37]  Building Up Being the God-men's Being Joined and Knit Together with Other God-men in the Divine Life by Their Growth in the Divine Life
[38]  Fifth, Galatians shows us that all of our living and work must pass through death and resurrection in Christ to be freed from the old creation and become the new creation for God's building on earth 6:14-15 .
[39]  Ephesians 3:17-19 says that Christ desires to make His home, to build His dwelling place, in our hearts that we may be filled with God unto the fullness of God for God's expression.
[40]  Furthermore, chapter four reveals to us that the Body of Christ is an organism constituted and built with the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and His redeemed people, with the Father as the source, the Lord as the element, and the Spirit as the essence to be its intrinsic factors and the God-chosen, regenerated, and transformed believers to be its outward frame.
[41]  Seventh, in Revelation, in 3:12-13 the Lord promised His overcomer that He would make him a pillar in the temple of His God for him to be one with God, with the New Jerusalem, and with the Lord in His new name.
[42]  In the city there is a throne as the center for the ruling of God's eternal kingdom; there are God and the Lamb as the temple in the city to be the place for His elect to worship and serve Him and to be their dwelling place; there are God and the Lamb as the light of the city; there is the river of water of life the Spirit flowing out of the throne, the center, to water the entire city and quench its thirst; and there is Christ as the tree of life growing in the river of water of life and producing new fruit in abundance as the supply to the entire city for its satisfaction and joy.
[43]  To be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son being that the believers become full-grown in life as God-men: To be conformed to Christ's death in all things through the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10.
[44]  To be the reprints of the God-man, Christ, that the believers may be exactly like Him, the firstborn Son of God 1 John 3:2.
[45]  It would be merely for sinners to be redeemed, have their sins forgiven, and become righteous people justified by God, but the purpose is unclear to the majority of believers who mistakenly consider their going to heaven as the purpose of their being redeemed and are unaware that, according to the revelation of the holy Scriptures, God's judicial redemption as the procedure is with God's organic salvation as the purpose, which is to regenerate us, shepherd us, sanctify us dispositionally, renew us, transform us, and build us up into the Body of Christ, which ultimately consummates the New Jerusalem as the ultimate purpose of God's organic salvation to be God's enlargement and expression in eternity.
[46]  In the previous messages we covered regeneration, shepherding, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and building up.
[47]  Regeneration is to have God's life put into us in addition to our own life.
[48]  After passing through regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, and conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God, the believers are mature and qualified to be raptured, and they are simply awaiting the Lord's coming back.
