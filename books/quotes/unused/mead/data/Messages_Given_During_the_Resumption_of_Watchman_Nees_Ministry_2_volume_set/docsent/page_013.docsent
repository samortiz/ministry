   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:December 29, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: Matt 28:20; John 15:5; Eph 3:17; Phil 2:12-13; Rom 8:26-27 WHERE IS THE LORD JESUS TODAY?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where is the Lord Jesus today?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a very interesting question.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some say that the Lord Jesus is at the right hand of the Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Others say that He is in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us consider what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are four Gospels in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Where was the Lord Jesus in the book of Matthew?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Where was He in the book of John?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 26, He was betrayed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter twenty-seven, He was crucified, and in chapter twenty-eight, He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I remember that when I was in Nanking a brother answered me promptly that in Matthew, the Lord Jesus is in ascension, whereas in John, the Lord Jesus is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. Being with Us</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The end of Matthew tells us that the Lord Jesus is "with you all the days until the consummation of the age" Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the book of Matthew, we see two names, Jesus and Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Emmanuel means God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No doubt God is God, yet He is now with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is true that He incarnated, grew up, worked, was betrayed, was crucified, and has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But today He is still with man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the Lord is here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is with us by being within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose we have two hundred fifty people here today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our physical eyes do not see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the Lord is not in our midst; He is not the two-hundred-fifty-first person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is with us by being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is not mingled among us, but He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Outwardly speaking, men see us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But inwardly speaking, there is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In every age, wherever the Lord's disciples are, the Lord is there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wherever there are believers, the Lord is there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. Being in Us</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where has the Lord gone in the Gospel of John?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John does not have chapter twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter twenty, He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Originally, He was God, coming in the flesh and living among men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now through the Holy Spirit, He enters into man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today, we do not merely have Jesus among us, but we have Jesus within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Outwardly we are a man, but inwardly we have God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God was once in Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Scriptures reveal to us that God in Christ has come into man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Oh, what a glorious fact!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a little man, I have God living within me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today I have become a great man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do you know who I am?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am "great."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am greater than the king of England.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is so much higher than the forgiveness of sins!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I wish I could shout.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you know who I am?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Jesus who is the King is now living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The One who is the eternal life has come to live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the one hand, He is in me as life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the other hand, He is ruling as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I am sad, He comforts me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I am confused, He enlightens me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I am in darkness, He shines on me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I rebel, He disciplines me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today He is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether or not you are a proper Christian, and whether or not you carry some spiritual weight with you depends on the way you take care of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you take care of Him properly, you will be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you do not take care of Him properly, you will not be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To be a Christian is fully a matter of your relationship with the Christ who is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not a matter of how much work you do or how much love you have.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a matter of having the proper relationship with the Lord.</S>
