   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we were saved, not only did we receive a clear sky, but we also received an expanding sky.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We had the sensation that our sky was expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After being saved for some time though, perhaps some problems arose with our relatives or with the church or with some of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Immediately, our sky became somewhat cloudy again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not as cloudy and as dark as before we were saved, but still it was not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as soon as we confessed our failures and applied His blood, condemning ourselves, our attitudes, our motives, and our intentions, right away the sky became clear once more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We came again under the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize this is the open and expanding heaven to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we as the living creatures reach this point, we have absolutely nothing between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also have nothing cloudy between one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is nothing as a covering or separation between us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the coverings, all the separations, all the clouds and fog are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have a thoroughly clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have a sky that is fully expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our expanse is as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When others look upon our clear sky, they will be astonished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is terrible because it is so clear; it is crystal-clear and expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only is the sky clear and expanding, but it is also stable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a rule, the sky above the earth always has some movement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Either the clouds are moving or the wind is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the sky above these living creatures is not moving.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is as stable as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no change whatever with this sky.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time we were saved, we enjoyed a clear sky, but only for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Like the weather in Los Angeles, our skies fluctuated very much.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes our sky became cloudy, but after we confessed our sins, it became clear again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shows a real fluctuation in the sky above our head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But here, above these living creatures' heads, it is not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here, the sky is like crystal, perfectly stable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no fluctuation in the weather.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The heaven above all these living creatures is clear and expanding and stable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have a thorough fellowship with the Lord vertically, and they also have a clear fellowship between themselves, horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have a wide and stable span of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every proper local church must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unfortunately though, in some local churches, it seems the sky is cloudy and narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is even difficult to stretch out two arms.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sky of that poor local church is so small.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no expanse and it is dark and very touchy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Occasionally, in some local churches it is difficult to say anything because the situation is touchy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy to offend some of the dear ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you say this, one will be unhappy with you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you say that, another will be unhappy with you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You dare not say anything because the situation is too touchy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a proper local church, there must be a broad sky.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There must be a clear sky that is not so touchy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No matter what you say, people would not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one would lose his temper at you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This does not mean that we need to be broad-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a frog is in a well, it means little as to whether he is broad-minded or narrow-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to jump out of the well and to get into the clear sky where the horizon is so broad.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do you think there is a possibility for any of the living creatures to be narrow-minded?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is impossible, because above their heads is the wide expanse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sky above their heads is clear, expanding, and terrible to behold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Under such a sky we have the proper fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>HAVING A STRAIGHT COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Under a clear and expanding sky, we are enabled to have the adequate and proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here the coordination is straight.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this chapter, the word straight is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is used once for the calf's hoofs, and it is used this time for the eagle's wings 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes in the local churches, the coordination is not perfectly straight.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, it is slightly crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, one brother might fellowship a matter with Brother John and then tell him, "Please do not tell Brother Bill."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then he would go to Brother Bill and pass on some information and tell him, "Please do not tell Brother James."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of coordination is playing politics.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should never play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I would say something to one brother, I must be able to say it to another.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our wings must be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our coordination must be frank, sincere, earnest, and straight.</S>
