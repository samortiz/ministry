   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE FIRSTFRUITS, THE HARVEST,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE GATHERING OF THE GRAPES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 14:1-20 I. THE FIRSTFRUITS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>REVELATION 14:1-5 A. Revelation 14:1</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is Mount Zion here the heavenly one or the earthly one?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not the earthly one for the following reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 By then, the earthly Zion will still be in the hands of the Gentiles 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2 Revelation 14:3 clearly says that these ones have been purchased from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By this we can realize that they are not standing on the earthly Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3 We know from the last two sentences of 14:4 and from Exodus 23:19 that the firstfruits are not left in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as they ripen, they are put into God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Exodus 34:26 says the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the hundred and forty-four thousand are the firstfruits, they should not be left in the field, which signifies the world Matt 13:38 , but should be put on the heavenly Mount Zion, which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4 Revelation 14:3 says that they stand "before the throne and before the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders are all in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>5 The ones described in 14:1-5 are the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is in accord with the matter of the harvest in verses 14-16.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the reaping of the harvest takes place in heaven, even more should not the firstfruits be in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>6 It is unreasonable to assume that this occurs on the earth at that time, because the Lord Jesus does not come to the earth until chapter nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who are these hundred and forty-four thousand?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are they the same group of people as the hundred and forty-four thousand in 7:4?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The hundred and forty-four thousand in 7:4 and the hundred and forty-four thousand mentioned here are two different groups of people, for:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 The group mentioned in 7:4 are selected from the Israelites; the group in 14:1 are purchased from the earth v. 3 and purchased from among men v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 The seal which the group in 7:4 receives is different from the seal which this group receives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the former case, it is "the seal of the living God" 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a term used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this case, the seal is the name of the Lamb and the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This name has to do with the church; hence, this group of people must be related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3 The ones in 7:4 are "the slaves of our God" v. 3 , while the ones in 14:1 are the children of God from the word "Father" in the last part of verse 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4 In Revelation, every time that the Lord calls God the Father, it is in relation to the church 1:6; 2:27; 3:5, 21 , never to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>5 The ones in 14:1 are related to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They stand with the Lamb, have the Lamb's name, and belong to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in chapter seven, the Lord is only an angel, returning to the position of a messenger in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>6 The song sung by the ones in 14:1 is "a new song" v. 3 , while the ones in 7:4 can sing only the old song.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>7 The ones in 14:1 are virgins v. 4 , but to be such among the Israelites was a matter of curse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Exodus 23:26; Deuteronomy 7:14; 1 Samuel 2:5; and Psalm 113:9 all show that childbearing is a blessing and that not to bear children is a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Judges 11:38-39 shows that to be a virgin is a thing to be mourned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>8 The articles used for the hundred and forty-four thousand in Revelation 7:4 and the hundred and forty-four thousand in 14:1 are indefinite articles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows that these two groups of a hundred and forty-four thousand are different people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The hundred and forty-four thousand in 14:1 are a special group of people in the church; they are not the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1 Since the number one hundred and forty-four thousand in 7:4 should be interpreted literally, the number in 14:1 should also be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2 If the number one hundred and forty-four thousand in 14:1 were not to be interpreted literally, there would be no way in which to interpret all the other numbers in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>3 The hundred and forty-four thousand are the firstfruits v. 4 . One cannot say that the whole church is the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>4 There is not the fact of the whole church being virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>5 These are raptured to Mount Zion before the great tribulation before the speaking of the three angels in verses 6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>6 Revelation 14:5 points out that they are different in their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a fact that not every regenerated Christian has this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are the overcomers, the called-out ones, in the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both John and Peter are included in this group.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From 14:1 we see that this group of people is related to the Lamb.</S>
