   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ATTACHED CORPORATELY TO THE ANOINTED ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:21 Paul says, But He Who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul was not attached to Christ in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, he says that the apostles were attached with all the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered with in verse 21 means together with.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Together with the rest of the believers, the apostles have been attached to Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This proves that Paul was not individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though he was the greatest apostle, he still needed all the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was with the believers in Corinth that he was attached to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, he was attached to Him corporately, not individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The One to whom we have been attached is Christ, God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible reveals that all the ointment of God has been poured out upon God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Apart from Him, there is no ointment, no anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the anointing was poured upon Christ, the process of anointing was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no ointment other than that which is on Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God does not do any more anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What He does concerning us today is to attach us together to this anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we have been attached to Him, we are attached to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, the anointing follows the attaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has attached us, and He has also anointed us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we are attached, we are anointed spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you know what it means to be anointed by God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that we are put into all the riches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The riches of the Triune God are now the ointment, and the ointment has been poured out upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are attached to Christ, we are under the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, we are anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are put into the practical enjoyment of all the riches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>POSSESSED BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1:22 Paul goes on to say that God has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The anointing in verse 21 is the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since God has anointed us in Christ, He has also sealed us in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This seal is a mark placed upon us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This mark can be compared to a person s signature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever I purchase a new book, I immediately write my name in it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every book belonging to me bears my signature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Writing my signature in a book illustrates what it means to be sealed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would live Christ, we must be attached to Him and enjoy the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then this anointing will become a seal indicating that we are possessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now that we have been anointed and sealed, we no longer belong to Satan or the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not even belong to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We belong to the Lord, to Christ, God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah, we are His!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to live Christ, we must first have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The same is true in principle with spending money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spending money requires that we have money to spend.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are in debt and have no money in our account, then we do not have any money to spend.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, if we do not have Christ, we cannot possibly live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But because we have been attached to the anointed One, anointed with the riches of the Triune God, and also sealed, we have the spiritual wealth required to write checks and draw on the riches from our spiritual bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can live Christ because we have Christ, and we have Christ because we have been attached, anointed, and sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul, the pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church, was attached, anointed, and sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a one has an abundance of riches to use for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>FULLY CAPTURED AND SUBDUED</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although we have been attached, anointed, and sealed, we still need to be captured by Christ in full.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is it not true that at least part of your being has not yet been captured by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps a rather large percentage of your inner being has not yet been captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A brother who has been partially captured by Christ may say to himself, Tomorrow is the Lord s Day once again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I don t want to go to the church meeting, but it is necessary for me to go.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I m sorry that I became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now that I have been saved, I know that I can t escape from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I would like to get away from Him, but it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ will not let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, my wife loves the Lord and is fervent for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She brings all the children to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I would much rather do something else instead of attending the meeting tomorrow, but I am overruled by my family.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They all want me to attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, I have no choice in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I must go to the meeting tomorrow to suffer and feel miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the attitude of one who has been captured by Christ only to a very limited degree.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Unless we have been captured by Christ, we cannot live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I surely have learned this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not think that I am always willing to be captured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Sometimes a part of my being is not pleased to be captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have learned that if we would be captured, we need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever you sense that part of you is not willing to be captured by the Lord, remember that you have been attached, anointed, and sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sometimes when I sense such an unwillingness within me, I recall the fact that I have been attached, anointed, and sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then I realize that it is my destiny to be captured and subdued so that I may live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only those who have been captured by Christ and subdued by Him can live Him for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is our destiny and, ultimately, concerning this we have no choice, preference, or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must be captured and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Have you been subdued by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I know of some wives who eventually were subdued by their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After a period of years, they were willing to recognize the husband as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But to be subdued by one s husband is not nearly as good as being subdued by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christ is always gentle, but He is strong and persistent.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He is able to wait as long as necessary until we are willing to be subdued by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we are not willing to be subdued today, He may wait for another year or even longer.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we are not subdued in this age, He knows we shall be subdued in the next age, or in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Eventually we all shall be subdued by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is much better to be subdued today.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is wise and also very profitable to be subdued now.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To wait even a short time before we are subdued may cause us to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I can testify that I do not regret being subdued by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When I was young, I had a good job with a good income.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then one day Christ came in to require me to give up my job and serve Him full time.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>However, I had a number of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord told me simply to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I said to the Lord that I was willing to suffer hunger for Him as long as He would take care of my wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord encouraged me to trust my wife and children to His care.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Nevertheless, I was concerned about what would happen to my family if I left my job to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I realized that the Lord is the almighty One, but still I felt it was safer to have the family in my own care.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I struggled with the Lord for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I wondered why He had provided me with a wife and children if it was His intention that I serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But after a while, I gave in to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This was nearly fifty years ago, and I can testify that the Lord has rewarded me a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>My point here is that whenever the Lord demands that we do something, He will most assuredly supply us for that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>To live Christ is not only a demand; it is a requirement that implies a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Every demand in the New Testament implies that the Lord will supply what we need to meet that demand.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The more He demands of us, the more He will supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In order to live Christ, we must first be captured by the Lord and then subdued by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If I had stayed with my job and not left it to serve the Lord full time, that would have been a sign that I had not been captured and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If that had been the situation, I could not have been used by the Lord for the raising up of churches in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Whether or not so many churches could be raised up depended upon the capturing and subduing of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What the Lord is able to do through you also depends on your willingness to be captured and subdued by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Therefore, it is a very significant matter to be captured and subdued by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>LED BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Paul could say to the Lord, Thank You, Lord Jesus, that You have attached me, anointed me, sealed me, captured me, and subdued me.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Now I am ready to be led by You.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Then the Lord could come in to lead Paul in His triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>As an apostle, Paul did not do anything according to his own choice, preference, or taste.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>On the contrary, he was truly led by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Paul took the Lord s leading, no matter what it was.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Concerning the Lord s leading, Paul did not have any choice.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>As the metaphor in 2:14 indicates, he considered himself a captive who had been placed in Christ s triumphal procession, a procession celebrating Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>How could such a captured one have any choice?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>There is no choice for captives.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Because Paul, a captive, was willing to be led, wherever he went was the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Paul did not travel in Asia Minor to carry on a work of evangelization.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>No, his travel was a move in Christ s procession.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Christ s triumphal procession was advancing through Asia Minor and onward to Macedonia and Achaia.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Paul was in a procession led by God to celebrate the victory of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I do not believe that my coming to this country was any kind of missionary work.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>It also was a move in Christ s procession, the Lord s celebration of His victory in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>As one captured, subdued, and led, I am a captive in this procession.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Praise the Lord that the procession celebrating Christ s victory in the recovery has come to this country!</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>By being attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led, we scatter the incense of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This scattering of the incense is actually to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The Christ we live has incense, and He even is this incense.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Therefore, when we scatter the incense of Christ, we scatter Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>This scattering of Christ as the incense has an effect: it is a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>For those who have been chosen by God, the scattering of the incense is unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>But to others, it is unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>This is a very serious matter, and Paul asks, Who is sufficient for these things?</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We praise the Lord that it is possible for us to be those who scatter the incense of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When we have been attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led, we shall scatter the incense of Christ.</S>
