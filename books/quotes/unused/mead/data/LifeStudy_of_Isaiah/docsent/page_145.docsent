   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 9 AS THE REDEEMER TO SAVE JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THEIR SINS AND INIQUITIES AND BECOME ISRAEL'S LIGHT AND GLORY FOREVER Scripture Reading: Isa 59 60; 42:6; 49:8; 54:10; Rev 21:23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the book of Isaiah, many precious things are hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two of these things are the keeping of the Sabbath and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To keep the Sabbath is to be "fired" and replaced by Christ so that we may get into Him and rest in Him for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, to keep the Sabbath means that we stop our work, that we cease from our intentions, and that we are fired and replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to be crucified with Christ with the result that it is no longer we who live, but Christ lives in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the early days I was taught that to fast is to restrict ourselves and our lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This teaching is not wrong, but it surely is not complete and it may lead to asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The real meaning of fasting according to the Bible is to cease from the taste for anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we fast in this way, we have an appetite only for Christ and we do not eat anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah's aspiration is that we all would rest in Christ and taste Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the New Jerusalem for eternity, we will have a life of resting and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our unique food will be Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, having been fully fired, we will not work but will be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will be the situation of everyone in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Up to chapter fifty-nine, the book of Isaiah consummates in the keeping of the Sabbath and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through all His processes, Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God has accomplished God's full redemption, and now He is applying His complete salvation to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although many Christians are preaching the gospel, few people receive this preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because people are busy working and eating, few have any room in their heart, any capacity in their being, for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, they all need to rest, to keep the Sabbath; they also need to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By resting and fasting we can partake of all that the processed Christ has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In totality, what He is and has accomplished is just the divine water, which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for us to drink and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I can testify that before I was saved, I was a busy and ambitious young man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when I heard the gospel and received the Lord Jesus, I immediately began to keep the Sabbath and to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now, more than sixty years later, I still like to rest and to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to be "fired" again and replaced by Christ more and more, resting in Him and fasting from every taste other than Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, we all need to learn to keep the Sabbath and to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us now go on to chapters fifty-nine and sixty, which reveal Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, as the Redeemer to save Jacob from their sins and iniquities and to become Israel's light and glory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having redeemed us, Christ is now our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the negative side, He is saving us from our sins and iniquities; on the positive side, He is our light and glory.</S>
