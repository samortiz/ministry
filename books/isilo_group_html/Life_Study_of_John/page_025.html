These water containers, made of stone, were six in number. The number six represents created man, because it was on the sixth day that man was created (Gen. 1:27, 31). Therefore, the six stone waterpots signify the natural man who was created on the sixth day. Naturally speaking, we are nothing but &ldquo;waterpots,&rdquo; vessels to contain something. We, the &ldquo;waterpots,&rdquo; were located in Cana, the land of reeds, full of weak and fragile people. We were the waterpots in Cana, weak and fragile.</p><h2 class="head3">3. &ldquo;The Jewish Rites of Purification&rdquo; with Water</h2><p>The waterpots were used in the Jewish rites of purification (2:6), a practice of the Jewish religion. The Jewish rites of purification with water signify religion&rsquo;s attempt to make people clean by certain dead practices. The ancient Jews took care of washing themselves and of keeping themselves clean and pure in God&rsquo;s worship. The Lord, on the contrary, changes death into life. The ritual purification with water is outward, without life, but the Lord&rsquo;s changing death into life is from within and is full of life.</p><h2 class="head3">4. &ldquo;Fill the Waterpots with Water&rdquo;</h2><p>The Lord told the servants to fill the waterpots with water, and they filled them up to the brim (2:7). What does this mean? As we shall see, it signifies that human beings are filled with death. The waterpots, that is, mankind created on the sixth day, are filled with the waters of death.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Jesus Changing Their Death into Life Eternal</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Water, Signifying Death</h2><p>When the Lord commanded the people to fill the six vessels with water, it indicated that the natural man is full of death. Water in the Scriptures has two symbolic meanings. In some cases it stands for life (John 4:14; 7:38); in others, death (Gen. 1:2, 6; Exo. 14:21; Matt. 3:16). The waters in Genesis 1 and the water of baptism signify death. In this instance, water also signifies death. All the stone vessels were full of water, meaning that all humanity is naturally full of death. Just as the waterpots were filled to the brim with water, so we were filled with death.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Wine as the Life-juice of the Grape,<br />Signifying Life</h2><p>The Lord Jesus marvelously changed this death water into wine (2:8-9). This miracle not only shows that the Lord Jesus can call things not being as being (Rom. 4:17), but also that He can change death into life.</p><p>The Lord&rsquo;s miraculously changing water into wine signifies that He changes our death into life. The water signifies death, and the wine signifies life. When the Lord changes our water into wine, that wine in our marriage feast will never end. Since we have been regenerated, life with its spiritual enjoyment will last forever. We shall have an eternal marriage feast which will never end. This feast is not in our original life, but in the new life which we received through regeneration. Even as the ruler of the feast discovered that the new wine is better than the former wine (2:9-10), so we too shall find that the life we receive through regeneration is much better than our natural life. Our former life, symbolized by the poor wine, was greatly inferior. The Lord did not give us the best first, but the best last. The first life, the human, created one, is an inferior life; the best life is the second life, the divine and everlasting one. This life is the best because it is the life of God Himself in Christ. So, our pleasure will last forever and ever. We have everlasting enjoyment, for Christ has translated us from death into life. He, as our everlasting, eternal life, can maintain our pleasures and enjoyment forever and ever. A new marriage feast began when we were saved, and it will never end. There is always joy within and there is always a marriage feast within because we have the divine wine, which is the divine life&mdash;the Lord Himself.</p> <p>We all have had this kind of experience. Before we were saved, we were waterpots filled with death water. One day we said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and He came and changed our death water into life. Regardless of the kind of death situation we might be in, if we turn our case over to the Lord Jesus, He will change that death into life. For example, even Christian husbands and wives may reach a point in their married life that the life runs out of their marriage. It seems that they are unable to go on in their married life. However, if they open to the Lord Jesus, He will change that death into life. In many marriages the Lord has changed death water into life wine.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of John &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
