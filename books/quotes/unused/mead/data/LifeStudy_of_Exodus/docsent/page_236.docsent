   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>STEALING SIGNIFYING THAT FALLEN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IS NOT SATISFIED WITH GOD S SOVEREIGN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ASSIGNMENT AND TRIES TO MAKE BASE GAIN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BY TRANSGRESSING GOD S REGULATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Stealing signifies that fallen man, like Satan, is not satisfied with God s sovereign assignment, but tries to make base gain by transgressing God s regulation 22:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps, in His arrangement, God does not assign many riches to you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, He arranges for you to be in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are you willing to be satisfied with the circumstances in which God has placed you?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are not satisfied, you may resort to stealing, to the transgressing of God s regulation in order to make base gain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Bible, stealing is fully condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in itself stealing is not always serious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is serious with respect to stealing is transgressing God s regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to be satisfied with the Lord s sovereign arrangement of our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because God is our Creator and we are His creatures, we should be satisfied with the circumstances He assigns to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are satisfied, we shall not break God s regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To steal is to be dissatisfied with the divine assignment and to break the divine regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past I knew some Chinese women who stole sewing needles from other members of the family when sewing needles were scarce.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In principle, they were no better than bank robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In both cases those who stole were not satisfied with God s sovereign assignment, but broke God s regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>COVETING SIGNIFYING SATAN S</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>LUSTING NATURE BECOMING THE INDWELLING SIN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>WITHIN FALLEN MAN TO DEADEN HIS BODY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ordinance concerning coveting 22:7-15 signifies that Satan s lusting nature has become the indwelling sin within fallen man to deaden his body Rom 7:8, 17, 20, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Romans 7 Paul tells us that he was not able to deal with the sin of coveting within him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually he described covetousness as indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not regard it merely as a thing or a matter, but as a person, even as Satan personified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sin of covetousness is actually Satan s lusting nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we are all fallen sinners, we are given to coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Stealing comes from coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a person does not covet anything, he will never steal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Coveting is Satan s lusting nature dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, whenever we are greedy or covetous, we should realize that this issues from Satan operating in us as indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ADULTERY SIGNIFYING SATAN S</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SINFUL NATURE WORKING IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>TO CORRUPT HIM BY CONFUSING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IN BREAKING GOD S REGULATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ordinance concerning adultery 22:16-17, 19 signifies that Satan s sinful nature works in man to corrupt him by confusing him in breaking God s regulations concerning the relationships man should have with God, with people, and with other things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to James 4:4, loving the world causes one to be an adulterer, for it confuses one s relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as a wife should not love another man besides her husband, we should not love anything in place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Revelation 17, the degraded church is called a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church should love Christ alone; however, the degraded church loves many things in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, the fallen church not only becomes an adulteress, but also becomes a fornicator, a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a wife becomes involved with one other man, that is adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if she becomes involved with many others, that is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fornication, therefore, is more serious than adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fallen church is not merely an adulteress; she is a fornicator and for this reason is called a harlot in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the sight of God, the earth today is filled with fornication, with confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man is confused in his relationship with others and with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the Bible, fornication refers to being wrong and confused in our relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, failing to maintain the right relationship with the government is fornication.</S>
