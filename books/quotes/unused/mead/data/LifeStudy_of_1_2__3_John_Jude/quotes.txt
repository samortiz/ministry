[1]  Life-Study of 1, 2, & 3 John, Jude 1 John
[2]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE ONE A WORD CONCERNING THE WRITINGS OF JOHN 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:2-3; 2:27; 3:9; 5:4, 18
[3]  We trust in the Lord to open up the Scriptures to us again and speak a fresh word to us all.
[4]  The thought in John s writings is absolutely divine.
[5]  This writing, the Gospel of John, tells us of One who is the eternal Word and the very God, and tells us that in this Word there is life, that this life is the light of men, that He became flesh, that in the flesh He was the tabernacle, that when we come to this tabernacle we receive grace and truth and enjoy His glory, and that such a wonderful One also became a Lamb.
[6]  As the Gospel of John supplements the synoptic Gospels, so the Epistles of John supplement the other New Testament Epistles.
[7]  I can testify that I have seen that eternal life has been reported to me, that I have a divine fellowship, that the divine anointing is within me, that I have been begotten of God, that I have the divine seed, and that I may be a person not touched by Satan.
[8]  As we go on, we shall see that John s writings are mysterious to human understanding and all-inclusive concerning the Person of Christ.
[9]  John s writings not only are all-inclusive concerning the Person of Christ and polemical against heresy, but they also inoculate the believers against all heretical doctrines philosophies concerning God and Christ.
[10]  Hence, Christ was one with the Father John 10:30 , working in the Father s name and with the Father John 10:25; 14:10b , doing the Father s will John 6:38; 5:30 , speaking the Father s word John 3:34a; 14:24 , seeking the Father s glory John 7:18 , and expressing the Father John 14:7-9 .
[11]  As the Sender and the Giver of the Spirit John 15:26; 16:7; 3:34b , whom the Father sent in His name the Son s name, John 14:26 , the Son, being the last Adam in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20 , who received all that is of the Son John 16:14-15 to testify concerning the Son and glorify the Son John 15:26; 16:14 , and who is the breath of the Son John 20:22 .
[12]  THE FOCUS THE MYSTERIES OF THE DIVINE LIFE In His Gospel
[13]  The focus of John s writings is the mysteries of the divine life.
[14]  In his Gospel the focus is the mystery of the manifestation of the divine life in the Person of Jesus.
[15]  In John s Epistles, especially in the first one, the focus is the mystery of the fellowship of the manifested divine life among the believers with God and with one another.
[16]  John s writings are not mainly for study and understanding; they are primarily for the enjoyment of God s children.
[17]  Then He goes on to say that He is the living bread and that if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever v. 51 ; that unless we eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, we have no life in us v. 53 ; that he who eats His flesh and drinks His blood has eternal life v. 54 and abides in Him v. 56 ; and that the one who eats Him will also live because of Him v. 57 , for he who eats this bread shall live forever v. 58 . To be sure, eating is strongly emphasized in chapter six of John s Gospel.
[18]  Often before we partake of the main course at dinner, we are served an appetizer.
[19]  In 1 John 1 the apostle John also gives us an appetizer.
[20]  This Word conveys the eternal life and is the divine Person of Christ as an account, a definition, and an expression of all that God is.
[21]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE FOUR THE DIVINE LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-2; 2:25; 3:15; 5:11-13, 20; John 1:4; 3:15-16, 36; 5:24; 6:47, 63; 8:12; 10:10, 28; 11:25; 14:6; Acts 11:18; Rom 5:10, 17, 21; 6:23; Eph 4:18; Col 3:4; 1 Tim 6:12, 19; 2 Tim 1:10; Titus 1:2; Heb 7:16; 2 Pet 1:3; Rev 2:7; 22:1-2, 14, 17, 19; Matt 19:16, 29 LIFE AND THE WORD OF LIFE
[22]  First John 1:2 says, And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us.
[23]  In this verse life is a synonym for the Word of life in the preceding verse.
[24]  Both life and the Word of life denote the divine Person of Christ, who was with the Father in eternity and was manifested in time through incarnation, and whom the apostles have seen and testify and report to the believers.
[25]  This manifestation of the eternal life was through Christ s incarnation, which John stressed strongly in his Gospel John 1:14 as an antidote to inoculate the believers against the heresy which said that Christ did not come in the flesh.
[26]  First John 1:2 says that eternal life was with the Father.
[27]  The eternal life that was released from within Christ through His death has been imparted into the believers through His resurrection.
[28]  Concerning this, 1 Peter 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.
[29]  This is the purpose of God s salvation, that is, to make His life our life so that we may become His children, partaking of His divine nature to enjoy all that He is and to live a life that expresses Him.
[30]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE FIVE THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE DIVINE LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:3-7
[31]  In previous messages we have considered the first of the basic matters in this Epistle the divine life.
[32]  In 1:3 John says, That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[33]  In 1:5 John says, And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.
[34]  In addition to the three main things in the preceding verses life, fellowship, and joy a further message, which the apostles have heard from the Lord, is to announce to the believers that God is light.
[35]  Hence, to have fellowship with the apostles, to be in the fellowship of the apostles, and to have fellowship with the Triune God in the apostles fellowship is to put aside our private interest and join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God s purpose.
[36]  When we enjoy the Triune God in the divine fellowship, we shall be brought into a situation where spontaneously we join ourselves to the apostles and the Triune God for a common purpose.
[37]  The purpose God desires to fulfill through the apostles and also through us is first that the believers would grow in the divine life by abiding in the Triune God.
[38]  Furthermore, God intends that, based upon the divine birth, the believers would live a life of the divine righteousness and the divine love to overcome the world, sin, death, the Devil, and idols.
[39]  In the foregoing messages we have considered two mysteries the mystery of the divine life and the mystery of the divine fellowship.
[40]  Although we have not covered these matters thoroughly, I believe that they have been somewhat opened to us and that we have at least received hints concerning how to delve into them further.
[41]  Of course, the Bible speaks both of sin and sins.
[42]  Now that we have been regenerated, do we still have sin dwelling in us?
[43]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the believers relationship in life with God is unbreakable, but their fellowship with Him can be broken.
[44]  Let us now go on in this message to consider the first condition that must be fulfilled if we are to maintain the divine fellowship: the confessing of sins 1:5 2:2 .
[45]  In 1:7a John says, But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[46]  1 Tim 6:16 ....this walking in the light, as He is in the light, is no mere imitation of God,...but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of God s eternal being: not imitation, but coincidence and identity of the very atmosphere of life Alford .
[47]  When we dwell, live, and have our being in God, we walk in the divine light, which is the expression of God.
[48]  Let us read all of 1:6: If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.
[49]  If we say that we have fellowship with God, who is light, and walk in the darkness, we lie, we are in the expression of the satanic darkness, and we do not practice the truth in the expression of the divine light.
[50]  Related to this first condition are the matters of abiding in God as light, walking in the divine light, and practicing the divine truth.
[51]  When we live in the divine life, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God s divine nature and through His nature in us, all our sin, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness.
[52]  It is significant that in 1:7 the apostle John speaks of the blood of Jesus His Son.
[53]  The name Jesus denotes the Lord s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title His Son denotes the Lord s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood.
[54]  Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God s fallen creatures with divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy which is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time.
[55]  Eternal life issues in the fellowship of the divine life, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need of the blood of Jesus the Son of God so that we may have more eternal life.
[56]  First John 1:6 may be regarded as an antidote to the heretical teaching of the Antinomians.
[57]  The Antinomians in John s time taught freedom from the obligation of the moral law and claimed that a person could live in sin and still have fellowship with God.
[58]  Now we must go on to see that the divine light is embodied in Jesus as God incarnate.
[59]  Because He is the embodiment of the divine light, the Lord Jesus said, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life John 8:12 .
[60]  The divine light that issues in truth and shines in life is embodied in the Person of the Lord Jesus, who is God incarnate.
[61]  Second, truth in the New Testament denotes Christ, who is God incarnated and in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily Col 2:9 , to be the reality of: a God and man John 1:18, 51; 1 Tim 2:5 ; b all the types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament Col 2:16-17; John 4:23-24 ; and c all the divine and spiritual things, such as the divine life and resurrection John 11:25; 14:6 , the divine light John 8:12; 9:5 , the divine way John 14:6 , wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption 1 Cor 1:30 .
[62]  Hence, Christ is the reality John 14:6; Eph 4:21 .
[63]  Third, truth is the Spirit, who is Christ transfigured 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 , the reality of Christ John 14:16-17; 15:26 and of the divine revelation John 16:13-15 .
[64]  As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ, who is God incarnate, is the reality of God and man, the reality of all the types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament, and the reality of all the divine and spiritual things.
[65]  In this message we shall continue to consider the meaning of the word truth in the New Testament.
[66]  In the New Testament the Greek word for truth, aletheia, also denotes the genuineness, truthfulness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness, and faithfulness of God as a divine virtue Rom 3:7; 15:8 , and of man as a human virtue Mark 12:14; 2 Cor 11:10; Phil 1:18; 1 John 3:18 and as an issue of the divine reality John 4:23-24; 2 John 1; 3 John 1 .
[67]  In Old Testament times the children of Israel worshipped God in a particular place Jerusalem.
[68]  Therefore, the children of Israel worshipped God in the place designated by God and with the offerings required by God.
[69]  In chapter four of John the Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship v. 20 . The Lord Jesus answered, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father v. 21 . The Lord s answer indicates that the dispensation was changing.
[70]  As we have fellowship with the Lord in our daily life, we shall be in the light.
[71]  In the light we see our sinfulness, and we realize that we are wrong in many matters.
[72]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE ELEVEN THE DIVINE LIGHT AND THE DIVINE TRUTH 3 Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:5-7
[73]  We have seen that truth is God, Christ, the Spirit, the Word of God, and the contents of the faith, the reality concerning God, man, and the universe, and the genuineness, truthfulness, and sincerity of God as a divine virtue and of man as a human virtue.
[74]  When this divine reality is partaken of and enjoyed by us, it becomes our genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and trustworthiness as an excellent virtue in our behavior to express God, the God of reality, by whom we live; and we become persons living a life of truth, without any falsehood or hypocrisy, a life which corresponds to the truth revealed through creation and the Scripture.
[75]  The divine reality is Christ who is the truth John 14:6 as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for God s worship John 1:29; 3:14 and as the fountain of living water, the life-giving Spirit John 4:7-15 , partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity in which they worship God with the worship He seeks.
[76]  Here in 1 John 1:6 aletheia denotes the revealed reality of God in its aspect of the divine light.
[77]  It is the issue and realization of the divine light in verse 5.
[78]  In Romans 3:7 Paul speaks concerning a different aspect of the truth: But if the truth of God abounded in my lie unto His glory, why still am I also judged as a sinner?
[79]  In this verse truth refers to the faithfulness of God.
[80]  This, of course, is different from the meaning of truth in 1:18, where truth denotes the characteristic of God as revealed through the visible things in the universe.
[81]  In 1:8 John says, If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[82]  Truth in verse 8 denotes the revealed reality of God, the real facts, conveyed in the gospel, such as the reality of God and all the divine things, which are all Christ John 1:14, 17; 14:6 ; the reality of Christ and all the spiritual things, which are all the Spirit John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6 , and the reality of man s condition John 16:8-11 .
[83]  God is faithful in His word v. 10 and righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son v. 7 . His word is the word of the truth of His gospel Eph 1:13 , which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ Acts 10:43 , and the blood of Christ has fulfilled His righteous requirements that He may forgive us our sins Matt 26:28 . If we confess our sins, He, according to His word and based upon the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us, because He must be faithful in His word and righteous in the blood of Jesus.
[84]  Verse 10 says, If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
[85]  Verse 8 proves that after regeneration we still have sin inwardly.
[86]  The word in verse 10 is the word of God s revelation, which is the word of reality Eph 1:13; John 17:17 and which conveys the contents of God s New Testament economy.
[87]  We need to admit that after regeneration we still have sin; that is, we still have indwelling sin in our sinful nature.
[88]  Because we still have sin within us, there is the possibility that we may sin.
[89]  In this message we shall consider verses 1 and 2 of chapter two.
[90]  In 2:1 John says, If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.
[91]  John did not have the confidence that the believers would always be able to keep themselves from sinning.
[92]  He knew that even though we may be alert concerning the sin that dwells in our flesh, we may still sin.
[93]  It is also correct to translate parakletos in 1 John 2:1 as Advocate.
[94]  According to John s word in 2:1 our Advocate with the Father is Jesus Christ the Righteous.
[95]  His righteous act Rom 5:18 on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners.
[96]  In verse 1 John says, My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.
[97]  As we have pointed out, the Lord Jesus Christ has offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins, not only for our redemption but also for God s satisfaction.
[98]  Although we have received the divine life and enjoy God, the apostles, the believers, and the church life in the fellowship of the divine life, we still need to be watchful concerning sin.
[99]  After covering these matters in chapter one, John goes on in chapter two to show us that the divine provision not only includes the blood of Jesus and the faithfulness of God, but also includes the living Person of Christ as our Advocate.
[100]  As the One who shed His blood for us, this Person is now our heavenly attorney taking care of our case.
[101]  Before we consider 2:3-6, I would like to say a further word concerning propitiation.
[102]  John says in 2:2, He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world.
[103]  According to its biblical meaning, propitiation leads to enjoyment, for it ushers in fellowship between God and us.
[104]  According to Paul s word in Romans 3:25, God has set forth Christ a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood.
[105]  In his first Epistle, John indicates that God s provision not only includes the blood of Jesus and God s righteousness and faithfulness, but also includes the Advocate who pleads our case with the Father and who Himself is our propitiation, our peacemaker.
[106]  Verses 1 and 2 of chapter two are a conclusion to the word in 1:5-10 regarding our confession and God s forgiveness of our sins, which interrupt our fellowship with Him.
[107]  Verses 3 through 11 deal with the second condition of, the second requirement for, our fellowship with God the requirement that we keep the Lord s word and love the brothers.
[108]  In verse 5 John continues, But whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected.
[109]  In this we know that we are in Him.
[110]  Confessing our sins is the first condition of our enjoyment of the fellowship of the divine life.
[111]  It is in this way that the Jews know God.
[112]  They know God objectively, apart from any subjective experience of Him.
[113]  But as those who have been born of God and who possess God s life, we know Him not merely objectively, but in particular we know Him subjectively and experientially.
[114]  We should love God and His children with the divine love, the love that is conveyed to us through the word of the Lord and that becomes our experience and enjoyment.
[115]  First we need to enjoy God s love and experience His love to such an extent that it fills us, saturates us, and becomes our very essence, causing us to be permeated with the love of God.
[116]  The old commandment referred to here is the commandment given by the Lord in John 13:34: A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
[117]  In verse 8 John says that the fact of the old commandment of brotherly love being new in the believers Christian walk is true both in the Lord and in us.
[118]  The first condition is the confessing of our sins, and the second condition is loving God and the brothers.
[119]  In order to confess our sins, we need to realize that we still have sin dwelling in our flesh and that it is always possible for us to sin.
[120]  Therefore, if we want to maintain our fellowship with God, we need to deal with sin, and we need to love God and love the brothers.
[121]  Because the divine fellowship is for the church life, there is not only the need for us to confess our sins, but also the need for us to love the brothers.
[122]  Whenever we receive the Lord s word into us, the essence of the divine supply comes in with light as its expression.
[123]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE NINETEEN THE TEACHING OF THE DIVINE ANOINTING 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:12-27
[124]  In the foregoing messages we have covered the first section of this Epistle and the first basic matter revealed in this book the fellowship of the divine life.
[125]  In verse 13 John goes on to say, I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning.
[126]  I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
[127]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY THE WORLD AND THE THINGS IN THE WORLD Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:15-17
[128]  In this message we shall consider 2:15-17, verses concerned with the world and the things in the world.
[129]  According to the context, the young men have overcome the evil one, the one who formed this anti-God system, the one who has systematized all things, all persons, and all matters.
[130]  They can overcome him because they have the word of God abiding in them.
[131]  We know from our experience that when the word of God abides in us and we stay in the Word as our refuge, we are protected from the evil one.
[132]  In verse 16 John also mentions the vainglory of life.
[133]  We have seen that the vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life.
[134]  Here the Greek word rendered life is bios, a word that refers to physical life, and also to the present life.
[135]  In the New Testament three Greek words are used for life: zoe, which refers to the divine life, the life of God; psuche, which refers to our human life, our soulish or psychological life; and bios, which refers to physical life.
[136]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE EXPERIENCING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:18-23 A WORD TO THE YOUNG CHILDREN
[137]  In 2:13 the apostle John writes a very simple word to the young children, those believers who are very young in the divine life: I write to you, young children, because you have known the Father.
[138]  In verses 18 through 27 John writes a much longer word to the young children in order to confirm what he has already written to them.
[139]  This subjective anointing, the moving of the composition of the Triune God with all His activities, can now teach us the things concerning the Triune God and His activities.
[140]  According to the Bible, we teach that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.
[141]  Isaiah 9:6 says that a Son has been given to us, yet His name is called the everlasting Father, or the eternal Father, or Father of eternity.
[142]  In chapter fourteen of the Gospel of John the Lord also says that if we see Him, we see the Father v. 9 . Furthermore, in this chapter the Lord says that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him vv.
[143]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:20-27 THE ANOINTING AND THE TRUTH
[144]  Here I would like to point out that when we speak of these matters, we are not fighting for doctrines.
[145]  However, we are fighting for the genuine experience of Christ so that Christians may enjoy Christ in order to grow in life.
[146]  The fact that to deny Jesus being the Christ equals denying the Father and the Son implies the thought that Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are all one, all of whom are the elements, the ingredients, of the all-inclusive compound indwelling Spirit, who is now anointing the believers all the time.
[147]  In this anointing, Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are all anointed into our inner being.
[148]  In verse 22 John indicates that to deny that Jesus is the Christ is equal to denying the Father and the Son.
[149]  The New Testament does not separate the Father and the Son.
[150]  Especially in the Gospel of John we see that the Son is always one with the Father.
[151]  Furthermore, the Son did not do His own work and will, He did not speak His own word, He did not seek His own glory, and He did not express Himself John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; 7:18 .
[152]  In the previous message we pointed out that according to 2:20-27 the Father and the Son are one.
[153]  It is absolutely correct to say that the Son is not separate from the Father, nor the Father from the Son.
[154]  Let us now go on to consider again 2:20-27.
[155]  In verse 27 John says, And as for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.
[156]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR THE ANOINTING AND THE ANTICHRISTS Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:18-27
[157]  In this message I would like to give a further word on the teaching of the divine anointing.
[158]  We have seen that the teaching of the anointing concerning the Divine Trinity is according to the believers growth in life.
[159]  We have also seen that the teaching of the divine anointing is for our abiding in the Triune God.
[160]  To deny that Jesus is the Christ is related to denying the anointing.
[161]  TO PRACTICE THE DIVINE RIGHTEOUSNESS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:28 3:10a
[162]  He here denotes the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all-inclusively, because it refers to He and Him in the preceding verse, which denote the coming Son, and it also denotes Him in this verse, referring to the Father who has begotten us.
[163]  John s word about not being put to shame indicates that some believers who do not abide in the Lord that is, do not remain in the fellowship of the divine life according to pure faith in Christ s Person , but are led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ v. 26 , will be punished by being put to shame from Him, from His glorious parousia.
[164]  In verse 29 John twice uses the word "know": "If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him."
[165]  The first use of the word know is a translation of the Greek word eideta, from oida, perceived with a conscious knowledge, a deeper inward seeing.
[166]  Because we have been born of God and because His life as a divine seed abides in us, we can abide in Him.
[167]  But if we experience what is written in this section of 1 John, we shall realize that what John speaks of actually involves being saturated with the Triune God.
[168]  Therefore, when we abide in the Triune God, He as the all-inclusive, compound, indwelling, life-giving Spirit will saturate us, and we shall be soaked with Him.
[169]  PRACTICING THE DIVINE RIGHTEOUSNESS A Charge to All Believers
[170]  In 2:28 John says, And now, little children, abide in Him, that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.
[171]  But if we do not abide in the Triune God, continually living the divine life, then at the Lord s coming back we shall suffer shame, which will be a kind of discipline exercised upon us.
[172]  In 3:2 John goes on to say, Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be.
[173]  We know that if He is manifested, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him even as He is.
[174]  Since we are the children of God, we shall be like Him in the maturity of life when He is manifested.
[175]  Verse 5 says, And you know that that One was manifested that He might take away sins; and sin is not in Him.
[176]  The Greek word for take away here is the same as that used in John 1:29.
[177]  There Christ as the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, the sin which came into the world through Adam Rom 5:12 .
[178]  The Reason a Child of God Cannot Practice Sin
[179]  Verse 9 says, Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.
[180]  To not practice sin does not mean that we do not commit sin in occasional acts; it means that we do not live in sin.
[181]  The seed here denotes God s life, which we received of Him when we were begotten of Him.
[182]  In verse 12 John continues, Not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother.
[183]  Cain s brother Abel was of God, a child of God v. 10 . The Greek word rendered evil one here is poneros, which means pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious.
[184]  In 3:14 John says, He who does not love abides in death.
[185]  If we do not love others, this is an evidence that we still remain in death.
[186]  TO PRACTICE THE DIVINE LOVE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:14-19a SOURCE, ESSENCE, ELEMENT, AND SPHERE
[187]  First John 3:14a says, We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.
[188]  In the foregoing message we saw that death is of the Devil, the source of death, and that life is of God, the source of life.
[189]  We have pointed out that through regeneration we have passed out of the source, essence, element, and sphere of death into the source, essence, element, and sphere of life.
[190]  In verses 17 and 18 John continues, But whoever has the livelihood of the world and beholds his brother having need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?
[191]  Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and truth.
[192]  TO PRACTICE THE DIVINE LOVE 3 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:19-24 THE ASSURANCE THAT WE ARE IN THE REALITY
[193]  In verse 19 John says, In this we shall know that we are of the truth, and we shall persuade our heart before Him.
[194]  In verses 18 and 19 John is telling us that if we love the brothers in truth, sincerity, honesty, as the outcome of our enjoyment of the Triune God, we shall have the assurance that we are in the divine reality.
[195]  In verse 20 John continues, Because if our heart blames us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
[196]  In 3:21 John says, Beloved, if our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.
[197]  We have such boldness in tranquility to contact God, to fellowship with Him, and to ask of Him, because there is no condemnation of the conscience in our heart.
[198]  In verse 22 John goes on to say, And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and practice the things which are pleasing in His sight.
[199]  This section reveals that abiding in the Lord is the living of the children of God by His eternal life as the divine seed, which grows in practicing the righteousness of their begetting God 2:29; 3:7, 10 and the love of their begetting Father 3:10-11, 14-23 .
[200]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY PROVING THE SPIRITS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 4:1-6
[201]  In 4:2 John continues, In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God.
[202]  The spirit here is the spirit of a genuine prophet motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth, a spirit that confesses the divine conception of Jesus, affirming that He was born as the Son of God.
[203]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE PRINCIPLE OF ANTICHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7
[204]  There are four verses in his Epistles where the apostle John speaks of antichrist.
[205]  In 2:18 he says that many antichrists have come; in 2:22, that the antichrist, the liar, is one who denies the Father and the Son; in 4:3, that the spirit of the antichrist does not confess Jesus; and 2 John 7, that the deceivers who have gone out into the world are antichrists.
[206]  Some condemn us for teaching that, according to the Scriptures, Christ is all-inclusive, for teaching that He is God, the Son, the Father, and the Spirit.
[207]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING
[208]  THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 John 4:1-6
[209]  Our burden in the Lord s recovery is to minister the Triune God as life and everything to us so that we may enjoy all that He is.
[210]  As the result of many years experience and study, we have come to see that, according to the entire revelation in the Bible, God s intention is to work Himself into us so that He may be our life and that we may live by Him to be His expression.
[211]  When the Son was on earth, He lived in the Father, and the Father lived in Him.
[212]  The Son never spoke His own word; He spoke the Father s word.
[213]  When John wrote his first Epistle, there were certain heretical teachings regarding the Person of Christ.
[214]  One of these heresies claimed that Jesus was not Christ.
[215]  Another heresy concerning Christ s Person claimed that Christ was God, but denied that He became flesh.
[216]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE PROVING THE SPIRITS 2 Scripture Reading: 1 John 4:1-6 DIFFERENT TEACHINGS AND DIFFERENT SPIRITS
[217]  In 4:1 John says, Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are out of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[218]  Hence, we need to test the spirits to see whether they have their source in God, whether they are out of God.
[219]  In 4:4 John continues, You are out of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.
[220]  The believers have overcome them by abiding in the truth concerning Christ s deity and concerning His humanity through divine conception, according to the teaching of the divine anointing 2:27 .
[221]  The One in the believers is the Triune God, who dwells in the believers as the all-inclusive, life-giving, anointing Spirit, and who strengthens us from within with all the rich elements of the Triune God Eph 3:16-19 .
[222]  In a foregoing message we pointed out that the principle of antichrist is to deny some aspect of Christ s Person and replace it with something other than Christ.
[223]  If someone denies an aspect of Christ revealed in the Scriptures, that one is following the principle of antichrist, although what he is doing may be done unconsciously and unintentionally.
[224]  We surely believe that God created the entire universe and, in particular, man in His image; that man sinned and became fallen; that God so loved the world that He sent His Son to be our Savior and Redeemer to die on the cross for our sins; that Christ, the Son of God, resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens, where He is now the Lord; that the Holy Spirit has been sent to convince people, to move in them, and to help them repent and believe in the Lord Jesus; and that the Holy Spirit enables us to behave in a way that glorifies the name of God.
[225]  In 4:7 John says, Beloved, let us love one another, because love is out of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.
[226]  The apostle s emphasis here is still the divine birth, through which the divine life has been imparted into the believers, the life that affords them the life-ability to know God.
[227]  In John s Gospel it was God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children John 1:12-13 ; in his Epistle it is we the children, in the fellowship of the Father s life, coming to the Father to participate in His love and light.
[228]  In 4:9 John goes on to say, In this the love of God was manifested to us, that God has sent His Son, the only begotten, into the world that we might live through Him.
[229]  In verse 12 John also speaks of God s love being perfected in us.
[230]  Yet, if we do not love one another with this love as it was manifested to us, that is, if we do not express it by loving one another with it as God did to us, it is not perfectly and completely manifested.
[231]  God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
[232]  In verse 18 John goes on to say, There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts our fear, because fear has punishment, and he who fears has not been perfected in love.
[233]  A literal translation of the first part of this verse would be, Fear is not in the love.
[234]  Fear does not refer to the fear of offending God and being judged by Him 1 Pet 1:17; Heb 12:28 , but to the fear that we have offended God and will be judged by Him.
[235]  Perfect love is the love that has been perfected in us by our loving others with the love of God.
[236]  God first loved us in that He has infused us with His love and generated within us the love with which we love Him and love the brothers v. 20 . First John 4:20 says, If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.
[237]  Loving God and practicing His commandments are the prerequisite of our loving the children of God.
[238]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX THE VIRTUES OF THE DIVINE BIRTH
[239]  In 5:6 John goes on to say, This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
[240]  Jesus, the Man of Nazareth, was testified to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism Matt 3:16-17; John 1:31 , by the blood He shed on the cross John 19:31-35; Matt 27:50-54 , and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure John 1:32-34; 3:34 .
[241]  By these three, God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us 1 John 5:7-10 so that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing in His name 5:11-13; John 3:16, 36; 20:31 .
[242]  The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality in life Rom 8:2 , germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation by regenerating them with the divine life.
[243]  In 5:9 John goes on to say, If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son.
[244]  God testified concerning His Son that we may believe in His Son and have His divine life.
[245]  But God s New Testament economy teaches that eternal life is the embodiment of the Triune God and that this life is anointing us with the essence of the Triune God.
[246]  In verse 14 John says, This is the boldness which we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
[247]  Here boldness refers to the boldness we have for our prayer in fellowship with God.
[248]  Based upon the fact that we have received eternal life through the divine birth by believing in the Son of God, we can pray, in the fellowship of eternal life, by contacting God, in the boldness of a conscience void of offense Acts 24:16 , according to His will, with the assurance that He will hear us.
[249]  It is in this way that we know God s will: by being one with Him, by abiding in Him, and by remaining in the fellowship of the divine life.
[250]  When we are in the fellowship of the divine life and our conscience is without offense, we have peace with God, and we also have boldness to pray, not according to our feeling, but according to His will.
[251]  What is described in 5:14-17 concerning the life-giving petition can be experienced only by those who are deep in the Lord.
[252]  In chapter three John says that he who practices sin is of the Devil v. 8 , and that everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin v. 9 . Then in verse 20 John says that if our heart blames us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
[253]  In 5:14-17 there is the indication not only that we have eternal life and enjoy it, but also that we can minister this life to others.
[254]  In 5:18 John tells us something that is closely related to our Christian life.
[255]  He says that everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin.
[256]  In 5:19 John goes on to say, We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.
[257]  Since we have been begotten of God, we are out of Him, out from Him, possessing His life and partaking of His nature.
[258]  Let us now go on to consider the last part of verse 20: This is the true God and eternal life.
[259]  This genuine and real God is eternal life to us so that we may partake of Him as everything for our regenerated being.
[260]  When we are in the true One and His Son Jesus Christ, the true One is called the true God, and His Son Jesus Christ is called eternal life.
[261]  In verse 21 John goes on to conclude Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
[262]  Idols refers to the heretical substitutes, brought in by the Gnostics and Cerinthians, for the true God, as revealed in this Epistle and in John s Gospel and referred to in the preceding verse.
[263]  We as genuine children of the genuine God should be on the alert to guard ourselves from these heretical substitutes and all vain replacements of our genuine and real God, with whom we are organically one and who is eternal life to us.
[264]  According to John s understanding, an idol is anything that replaces, is a substitute for, the subjective God, the God whom we have experienced and whom we are still experiencing.
[265]  The safeguard against his evil doing is our divine birth with the divine life 5:18 , and, based upon the fact that the Son of God has through His death on the cross destroyed the works of the Devil 3:8 , we overcome him by the word of God that abides in us 2:14 .
[266]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND JOHN MESSAGE ONE THE WALK IN TRUTH AND LOVE Scripture Reading: 2 John 1-6 THE SUBJECT OF THE EPISTLE
[267]  The subject of this book is the prohibition of participation in heresy.
[268]  John speaks of heresy in verse 7: Because many deceivers went out into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh.
[269]  Certain heretics denied that Jesus is the Christ 1 John 2:22 , and others denied the Son, not confessing that Jesus is the Son of God 1 John 2:23 .
[270]  In verses 4 through 6 John speaks concerning the walk in truth and love.
[271]  Verse 4 says, I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.
[272]  The Father commands us to walk in this reality, that is, in the realization of the divine fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God see Matt 17:5 , that we may honor the Son as the Father desires John 5:23 .
[273]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND JOHN MESSAGE TWO NOT PARTICIPATING IN HERESY Scripture Reading: 2 John 7-13
[274]  In this message we shall consider verses 7 through 13 of 2 John.
[275]  A false Christ is one who pretends deceivingly to be the Christ, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ s deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God 1 John 2:22 , not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit 1 John 4:2-3 .
[276]  If we are not led astray by the heresies, but abide faithfully in the truth concerning the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ who is both God and man, both our Creator and Redeemer, we shall enjoy in Him the Triune God to the fullest extent as our full reward, even today on earth.
[277]  In verse 9 John continues, Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son.
[278]  Hence, to deny the incarnation is to reject this divine enjoyment; but to abide in the truth of incarnation is to have God, as the Father and the Son, for our portion in the eternal salvation and in the divine life.
[279]  JOHN S CONCLUSION IN THIS EPISTLE Hope of Closer Fellowship for More Joy
[280]  In verses 12 and 13 we have the conclusion of this Epistle.
[281]  In verse 12 John expresses the hope of closer fellowship for more joy: Having many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to be with you and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be made full.
[282]  Here the apostle expresses his desire for a deeper and richer fellowship with the church member for fullness of joy in the enjoyment of the divine life 1 John 1:2-4 .
[283]  According to 1 John 5:20, we not only experience and enjoy the Triune God, but we are in Him: And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.
[284]  LIFE-STUDY OF THIRD JOHN MESSAGE ONE HOSPITALITY TO THE TRAVELING WORKERS Scripture Reading: 3 John 1-8
[285]  The subject of the Epistle of 3 John is encouragement to the fellow workers in the truth.
[286]  In verse 3 John goes on to say, For I rejoiced greatly at the brothers coming and testifying to your truth, even as you walk in truth.
[287]  The truth concerning the Person of Christ is the basic and central element of John s mending ministry.
[288]  As in 2 John 4, truth here is the divine reality, especially concerning the Person of Christ as revealed in John s Gospel and first Epistle, that is, that Christ is both God and man, having both deity and humanity, possessing both the divine nature and the human nature, to express God in human life and to accomplish redemption with divine power in human flesh for fallen human beings so that He may impart the divine life into them and bring them into an organic union with God.
[289]  Both 2 John and 3 John are based on 1 John.
[290]  Both 2 and 3 John indicate that we need to live in truth and walk in truth.
[291]  We need to join ourselves to anyone who works for the divine reality of the Triune God that we are enjoying, and we need to do whatever we can to promote this work.
[292]  HOSPITALITY TO THE TRAVELING WORKERS Given Faithfully in Love, and
[293]  In verses 5 and 6 John goes on to say, Beloved, you do faithfully in whatever you may have wrought for the brothers, and this for strangers, who testified to your love before the church, whom you will do well to send forward worthily of God.
[294]  LIFE-STUDY OF THIRD JOHN MESSAGE TWO IMITATION NOT OF THE EVIL BUT OF THE GOOD Scripture Reading: 3 John 9-14
[295]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the subject of this Epistle is encouragement to fellow workers in the truth.
[296]  Verses 1 through 4 are the introduction and speak of loving in truth v. 1 , prospering in all things and in health v. 2 , and walking in truth vv.
[297]  In verse 12 John goes on to say, To Demetrius testimony has been borne by all, and by the truth itself; and we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.
[298]  LIFE-STUDY OF JUDE MESSAGE ONE CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH Scripture Reading: Jude 1-7
[299]  With this message we begin the life-study of the book of Jude.
[300]  In these verses Jude says, Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ: mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.
[301]  In verse 4 Jude goes on to say, For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
[302]  In verse 7 Jude continues, As Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who in like manner with these gave themselves over to fornication and went after other flesh, are set forth as an example, undergoing the penalty of eternal fire.
[303]  This word proves that the angels in the preceding verse are the sons of God in Genesis 6:2, who committed fornication with strange flesh and were condemned by God for the judgment of the great day, for immediately following that was the judgment on Sodom, Gomorrah, and the cities around them.
[304]  LIFE-STUDY OF JUDE MESSAGE TWO EVILS OF THE APOSTATES AND THEIR PUNISHMENT UNDER THE LORD S JUDGMENT Scripture Reading: Jude 8-19
[305]  In the foregoing message we saw that the subject of the Epistle of Jude is contending for the faith.
[306]  Jude charges us to contend for the faith, and then he goes on to speak concerning apostasy v. 4 . In verses 5 through 7 he gives some historical examples of the Lord s judgment upon apostasy.
[307]  The ungodly men spoken of in verse 4 are dreamers, bearing the name of Christians yet doing things as in dreams, such things as perverting the grace of God into licentiousness to defile their flesh and denying Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord, despising His lordship and reviling the authorities in His heavenly government.
[308]  The way of Cain is the way of serving God religiously after one s own will and rejecting heretically the redemption by blood required and ordained by God.
[309]  Those who follow the way of Cain are according to the flesh and envy God s true people because of their faithful testimony to God Gen 4:2-8 .
[310]  In verse 12 Jude goes on to say, These are hidden reefs in your love feasts, feasting together with you without fear, shepherds that feed themselves, waterless clouds, carried along by winds, autumn trees without fruit, having died twice, rooted up; wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shames, wandering stars, for whom the gloom of darkness has been kept for eternity.
[311]  LIFE-STUDY OF JUDE MESSAGE THREE CHARGES TO THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Jude 20-25
[312]  In verses 20 through 23 Jude gives certain charges to the believers.
[313]  In verses 20 and 21 he charges the believers to build themselves up in the holy faith and to live in the Triune God.
[314]  According to verse 20, if we would build up ourselves in our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit.
[315]  Faith is related to the Word, and in the Holy Spirit we have life.
[316]  Therefore, if we have the Word applied to us and the Spirit working within us, we shall be kept in the enjoyment of God s love as we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
[317]  Jude concludes verse 21 with the words unto eternal life.
[318]  Here the word unto means issuing in or resulting in. The enjoyment and inheritance of eternal life, the life of God, is the goal of our spiritual seeking.
[319]  Because we aim at this goal, we want to be kept in the love of God and await the mercy of our Lord.
[320]  Neither is he saying that if we keep praying in the Holy Spirit and remain in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of the Lord we shall eventually have eternal life.
[321]  In the opening words of Peter s first Epistle we can see the Triune God: According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ v. 2 . Here we have the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[322]  We have pointed out that the Epistles of Peter are on the subject of God s government, in particular on God s governmental dealings through judgment.
[323]  Nevertheless, the structure of 1 and 2 Peter is the Triune God, who has been processed to become our portion so that we may participate in Him, partake of Him, and enjoy Him through His Spirit, who is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of glory, and by the exercise of our spirit.
[324]  Here unto means issuing in or resulting in. This phrase indicates the enjoyment of the Triune God.
[325]  Eternal life is the Triune God, and unto eternal life indicates the full enjoyment of what the Triune God is.
[326]  God selected us for a purpose, and this purpose is that God would put Himself into us as our life so that we may grow with Him into a building, His dwelling place.
[327]  LIFE-STUDY OF JUDE MESSAGE FIVE THE BASIC STRUCTURE
[328]  OF THE EPISTLES OF PETER AND JUDE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2-4, 11, 18-19, 22-23; 2:2, 5; 5:10; 2 Pet 3:15-16, 18; Jude 20-21
[329]  After God created man, He placed him in front of two trees signifying these two sources.
[330]  God is signified by the tree of life, and Satan is signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[331]  According to Jude 20 and 21, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God, and wait for the mercy of Jesus Christ so that we may have the enjoyment and increase of eternal life forever.
[332]  Therefore, Peter refers to the believers as living stones v. 5 . These stones are for the building up of a spiritual house, and this house is a holy priesthood: You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ v. 5 . On the one hand, this spiritual house is God s dwelling place; on the other hand, it is something that tells forth the virtues of God, that expresses what God is.
[333]  In these two portions of 1 Peter, including 5:10, we have the central focus of this book.
