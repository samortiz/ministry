   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Sixty-nine THE SALVATION OF THE PARALYZED MAN Scripture: Mark 2:1-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following points are concerning the selection of materials for gospel preaching: When you choose this passage for a gospel message, never emphasize that this is a case of a paralyzed man being healed, because people might misunderstand that this is just a sickness that was healed and not realize that it is a matter of a soul being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not go to the book of Matthew to find a story of healing for preaching the gospel, because that book shows us that the Lord Jesus is the King expressing authority, rather than one ministering to man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The narrative in Matthew does not fit as gospel material.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, when you want to use the miracles performed by the Lord Jesus as gospel material, take the text from the book of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you are preaching the gospel of life, take the text from the book of John.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you are preaching the gospel of forgiveness of sin, Luke is the book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Outwardly speaking, the miracles in the four Gospels show that the Lord healed the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In reality, the Lord saved the person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, all the miracles in the gospels should be considered as symbols of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you use the gospels of Luke and Mark, the more simple and common the title, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your presentation should also be simple and easily understood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you use the gospel of John, the title and the presentation should be deeper, because it is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man was born paralyzed, sick of the palsy</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the gospels, the sickness of the physical body symbolizes the sickness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, this paralysis means the paralysis of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before God, man can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As to pleasing God or obeying the will of God and doing good, man is just like one paralyzed, without any strength.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Give an example of the paralyzed condition of man in the matter of doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He knows that he should do good, yet he just cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He knows that he should be kind and live righteously, yet he is not able to be kind or live righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Touch people s feeling at the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Jesus came In the second chapter of Mark Jesus went into Capernaum which was a slum area of Galilee filled with paralyzed people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The place where man lives is just like a slum area for paralyzed people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Jesus entered into Capernaum, He came not openly in the street, but into a house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christianity is such a house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The denominations Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. are such houses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the homes of believers may be such houses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Come to Jesus Jesus came to save us; yet we still need to go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although He came into the house, yet He was surrounded by the house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to break through this house to come close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Anyone that comes to Jesus needs to break through His surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What was it that surrounded Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was the house where He was.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Christians in Christianity are the surroundings of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although in Christianity there is some measure of Christ, yet the organization and the Christians themselves have completely imprisoned Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you blame them in this way, the listeners will surely agree with you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have never respected the organization of Christianity, nor the Christians with their so-called Christian families.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you point out these things and preach in this way, the listeners will surely agree with you, and the gospel meeting will be opened up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>People will get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You should know people s psychology when you are preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not think people will not be convinced, when you are condemning Christian organizations and nominal Christians in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes it is really convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, in China, Dr. John Sung strongly condemned the Western missionaries when he was preaching; yet the missionaries were helped while the listeners were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For he condemned the sins, but he did not condemn the sinning ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is confined by the house by many Christian schools, Christian hospitals, and Christian homes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Christ may be in them, they have confined Christ so that man can hardly approach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way to break through: You need transcendency.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They climbed over the roof top of the house which surrounded Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was the same as Zaccheus, who climbed the sycamore tree.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need to transcend over the house of Christianity, the Christian organizations, the Christian works, and even Christians themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You need to tear down the roof top.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Tear through the Christian organizations and you will see Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You need to present yourself and your condition before Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what the paralyzed one did in presenting himself on his bed in front of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you want to come to Jesus, you should do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Anything you do to come to Jesus should be done in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord s salvation The paralyzed one only knows the result of being paralyzed, but does not know the cause of his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We only know we should do good, but have no strength to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As far as doing good is concerned, man is paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet we do not know the cause of being paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The paralyzed one does not know the cause of being paralyzed, yet the Lord knows the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the paralyzed one came to the Lord for healing, the Lord did not heal his sickness first; rather, He said, Your sins are forgiven, because the cause of being paralyzed was sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, friends, if you do not want to be paralyzed in your human living, you have to solve the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The healing of the paralyzed man was based on the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our salvation is also based on the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You need to touch people s feeling on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do you not feel guilty in your conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do you not feel that you are sinful?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You should not consider your own ability in doing good; rather, you should pay attention to the cause of not being able to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, you should take care of the problem of the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only God can forgive man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because the Lord Jesus is God, He can forgive man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At that time Jesus said, Your sins are forgiven, and they all murmured.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today, although there is some measure of Christ in Christianity, however, many still do not know that Christ can forgive sins, so even their own sins have not been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Here you should condemn the pastors and elders in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are the scribes daily preaching from the Bible; yet they do not know that the Lord can forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even their own sins have not been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The proof of the forgiveness of sins is that the paralyzed man rose up, took up his bed, and walked out.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once a man receives the Lord, his paralyzed condition is healed and he can rise up and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Formerly, it was the bed that held him; now he can take up his bed and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once he followed his bed; now his bed follows him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In Jesus, nothing is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Which is easier, to forgive sins or tell the paralyzed one to rise up and walk?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the Lord all things are easy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But the scribes murmured and said, It is too hard to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Who has the authority to forgive man s sins?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Actually, to tell the man to take up his bed and walk is even harder.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you tell him to take up his bed and walk, he cannot rise and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What shall you do?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The results of being saved The man not only had his sins forgiven, but also rose up and walked.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once a man comes to the Lord Jesus and is saved, he not only has peace within, but also has the outward strength to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Once a man comes to the Lord Jesus and is saved, he can glorify God.</S>
