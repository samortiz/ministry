   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:14; John 7:38-39; 20:21-22; Luke 24:49; 1 Cor 12:13; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; Eph 5:18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the mingling of God with us is a matter of our receiving the divine life and that oneness is a matter of our being built up as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, we have seen that oneness is the issue and expression of the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are mingled with God, the oneness of the Body of Christ is automatically and spontaneously manifested among us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the mingling of God with man and the oneness of the Body involve God being made one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to be one with us, God as the Spirit came into our spirit that we might be mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is in this mingled spirit that we are one with God Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEING MINGLED WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THROUGH THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The God in whom we believe is the Triune God; that is, He is one, yet He is three.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is impossible to thoroughly understand this because it is far beyond our ability to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it is a fact that our God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is one, yet He is also the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Deut 6:4; Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It may help to see how God is triune by using 2 Corinthians 13:14, which says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse mentions the three of the Triune God God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit and also three matters love, grace, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Love is of the Father, grace is of the Son, and fellowship is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How are the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit related to each other?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Love is an inward matter; it is the hidden, intrinsic source within a person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For instance, suppose there is a brother whom I love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My love toward that brother is something hidden within me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, suppose I present a gift to this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an expression of my love; my love for the brother is expressed through the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the expression of love is grace; grace is love expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace and love are actually two aspects of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are like the two ends of a cord; what we see on one end is love, and what we see on the other end is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is in the heart of God is love, but when the love of God is expressed to us, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ, because Jesus Christ as grace is the expression of God and the expression of God s love v. 18; 1 John 4:9 . Love is the source within God, and grace is the expression of that love to us in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, love is of the Father, and grace is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When love is expressed, it becomes grace, but how does this grace reach us?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This grace reaches us by the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, who is the transmitting substance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Love is in grace, and grace is in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Love is the source, grace is the expression of the source, and fellowship is the transmission and realization of the expression with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is love vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>8, 16 , and we know God as love because He is expressed through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ as the expression of God is grace to us, and this grace is the expression of the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, we can touch, experience, and realize this grace in the Holy Spirit and through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Father is the source, the Son is the expression of the source, and the Holy Spirit is the transmission and realization of the expression with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the Holy Spirit is in us, we can experience the Son and the Father, who is in the Son Rom 8:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we did not have the Holy Spirit, we would not have the Son, and if we did not have the Son, we would not have the Father, because the Father is in the Son John 14:10 , and the Son is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The three are one, just as love, grace, and fellowship are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Holy Spirit transmits everything that Christ is to us, and Christ is simply the expression of God Himself John 14:26; 15:26; 16:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, if we are going to apply Christ and be mingled with the Triune God, we must experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only way we can touch and contact the Son and the Father, who is in the Son, is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am very burdened concerning our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we lack is the experience of Christ, and the only way we can obtain, experience, and realize Christ is by experiencing the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are going to enjoy the love of God, we must have the grace of Christ, and if we are going to have the grace of Christ, we must have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit that we have the grace of Christ and the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The love is in the grace, the grace is in the fellowship, and the fellowship is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, we must have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>BEING BORN OF THE SPIRIT, FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>AND BAPTIZED IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As Christians we already have the Spirit in our spirit Rom 8:16 ; if we did not have the Spirit, we would have neither Christ nor God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, most of us have not experienced the Spirit in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The best example in the Scriptures of one who fully experienced the Spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First, the Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was begotten in the womb of His mother Mary by the begetting of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second, as He was being raised, the Lord Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is indicated by Luke 2:40, which says that the Lord Jesus was filled with wisdom, which is something of the Holy Spirit Isa 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was not only born of the Spirit; He was also raised in the Spirit and filled with the Spirit, and He walked and lived in the Spirit, as indicated by His caring for the things of the Father in Luke 2:40-52.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was a man of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may think that it was sufficient for Him to be born of the Spirit and filled with the Spirit and to walk and live a life in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, when the Lord presented Himself at the age of thirty and was baptized in water, the heavens were opened to Him, and the Holy Spirit descended and came upon Him like a dove Matt 3:16; Luke 3:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the time of His baptism Jesus already had the Holy Spirit inwardly, yet the Holy Spirit still had to come upon Him outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus, the Lord Jesus went through three steps in His experience of the Spirit: He was born of the Spirit, filled with the Spirit, and baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As genuine Christians we surely have been born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Gospel of John tells us that when we were regenerated, we were born again of the Spirit 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, we also need to experience being inwardly filled with the Spirit Acts 13:52; Eph 5:18 and being outwardly baptized in the Spirit Acts 1:5; 1 Cor 12:13a .</S>
