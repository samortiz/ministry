<h2 class="head1">GOD'S GOAL BEING TO DISPENSE LIFE TO MAN</h2><p>Watchman Nee: If Adam had not sinned, would God have reached His goal? No! Adam was created by God, but he was not begotten by God. The angels were created by God. Cattle, sheep, trees, and, of course, man were all created by God. If man had not sinned, at the most he would have been the highest creature; he still would not have had God's life. God's goal is to dispense His life into the created man. Unless His life enters into man, His goal is not reached. Hebrews 2 says that God wants to bring many sons into glory. When He leads many sons into glory, God's goal is attained (v. 10). In Genesis 2 Adam did not lose his temper; he did not lie. He and Eve did not argue or fight as husband and wife, but even before they fell, they had need of life. They did not need life only after they fell. Whether or not Adam sinned, he still needed God's life. From the beginning God ordained that man would have His life.</p><h2 class="head1">ADAM'S FALL</h2><p>What was Adam's sin? First, we have to know that Adam did not commit any sin of lying, reviling, stealing, envying, or arrogance. What he committed was the sin of knowing good and evil. When a man knows good and evil, he has sinned. The knowledge of good and evil is sin itself. Some may ask: Did Adam know good and evil before he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Of course he did. If a man does not know good and evil, he must be mentally deranged. Adam was not mentally deranged; he gave names to all the animals. He knew his zoology well. How then did he know good and evil? He knew it by asking God. His knowledge of good and evil came from God. He did not have any knowledge of good and evil in himself, but after he was tempted to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he could say, "Now I know good and evil. Now I can tell the difference between the two. I no longer have to ask God." Adam had confidence in himself. He did not need to ask God. He knew what was right and what was wrong. It was not a big sin to eat the fruit, but after he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he began to know good and evil in himself, and he began to live according to this knowledge. After man knew good and evil, he became evil in reality because he became independent from that day onward. The root of sin is independence.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING GOD'S SALVATION IN LIFE</h2><p>Because Adam sinned, all of his descendants have sinned. How can we remove sin today? Moreover, the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). How can we overcome death? Only life can deal with both sin and death. If we deal with our temper per se, we can never be freed from it. Paul was clear that he could never rid himself of sin by his own willing. He could keep nine of the Ten Commandments in the law. But he could not keep one&mdash;the law forbidding covetousness, because he was dealing with covetousness itself (7:7-9). This was the reason he was unsuccessful. In Romans 8, however, he declared in triumph that the law of the Spirit of life has overcome the law of sin and of death. He not only overcame the law of death, but the law of sin as well (vv. 1-2). Humanly speaking, sin is not the object of life's operation, but spiritually speaking, we counter evil with life, not with good. We cannot counter evil and sin with good because both evil and good are on the same side; they are products of the same tree. We cannot deal with one thing by using another thing of the same kind. The salvation in Christ has nothing to do with countering evil with good. Some have tried to counter pride with humility or rashness with meekness. This will never work.</p><p>On the one hand, the Lord died on the cross for the purpose of dealing with the frustration of the fall. On the other hand, He died for the purpose of dispensing His life to us. His death is not only the death of the Lamb for the accomplishment of redemption but the death of a grain of wheat for the producing of many grains (John 12:24). This death is not just a redemptive death but a death that multiplies itself into many grains. With the Lord there is the redemptive aspect of His death and there is the non-redemptive aspect of His death. The Lord said that His death was like a grain of wheat that fell into the earth and died. A grain of wheat does not have blood. Hence, the death of the grain is not for redemption but for the dispensing of life. The Lord has dealt with sin already. Today He wants us to live by His life. Therefore, we should not live in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; we have to live in the realm of the tree of life.</p><p>Whenever we are conscious that we are doing good or that we are doing evil, we have need of God's salvation. If we can tell both good and evil, we know that we are still living under the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because these are things from that tree. Of course, this does not mean that we should not do good. It means that God's life has entered into us and that we can live out this "good" spontaneously. What is the difference between the humility that flows from God's life and the humility that comes from us? Anything that we perform in ourselves is the result of good overcoming evil. We are very conscious of this overcoming. We may overcome a few times and after ten years still remember these experiences and testify about them. But these endeavors are from ourselves. They are things from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When a young brother or sister becomes conscious of his or her virtues before the Lord, we can tell that he or she is living in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p>Everything that God does within us is probably hidden from us; we do not know it, but anything that we do by ourselves is outward. Moses' face shone, but he did not know about it (Exo. 34:29). Today many people are conscious of their growth and their victory. I almost have to stomp my feet and shout, "You know too much! You know more than even God!" Those who are conscious that they are doing good are probably sunk in pride. When a man is touched by life, he will have nothing to be proud of. He will not know what is good and what is evil. He will only know God. Only the proud ones think that they know everything. Such ones are living in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God's goal is to deliver us from good and evil, as well as from the knowledge of good and evil. God wants to be our life within us. He wants us to be a channel of life and He wants to flow out of us. We do not know how this life works within us. We do not have to think about it or know about it. When God's life breaks out of us, it is spontaneous, like a new natural law operating within us.</p><p>May we not live in besetting sin but in God's eternal plan and the flow of His life. As long as we live in the flow of life, temper, rashness, pride, jealousy, etc., will all disappear. Spontaneously, we will be able to say with Paul, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (Rom. 8:2). We will be delivered from a life of feelings and move on to a life beyond feelings, from a life of knowledge to life itself. God is saving us from more than the things we inherited from Adam, that is, sin and death; He wants us to inherit what He has prepared for us&mdash;His own life.</p>
