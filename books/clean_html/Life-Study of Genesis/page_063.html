<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Life Conforms the Believers to the Image of God<br>and Brings Them into Glory</H2><P>The Bible says that it is life which conforms the believers to the image of the Son of God (Rom. 8:2, 6, 29). Only by the way of life can we be conformed to the image of the Son of God. Romans 8:2 speaks of "the Spirit of life," and verse 6 mentions that the mind set on the spirit is life. It is by this life of the Spirit that we can be conformed to the Son of God. This is very clear. Also, it is Christ as life who brings us into God's glory to express God. Colossians 3:4 tells us that Christ our life will bring us into God's glory that we may express God. This confirms the claim that it is by God's life that we express God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Resurrection Life Gives Authority</H2><P>The Bible also shows that it was the budding resurrection life which gave authority to Aaron's rod (Num. 17:8). Twelve rods representing the twelve tribes of Israel were placed in the presence of the Lord for one night. Each rod was a piece of dry, dead wood. During the night, Aaron's rod budded, signifying that resurrection life had authorized his rod to reign over the people. Thus, life gives authority. If you are going to be a leading one in the church, you need a great deal of life. Elders are assigned not only by the outward appointment but by the inward authorization in life. All elders should be matured in life and qualified to rule by this reigning life. This is also true for the deacons, the deaconesses, and the leading ones in the service groups. Only life can assign authority.</P><P>Revelation 20:4 says that it is the overcoming resurrection life which brings believers into the reign with Christ during the millennium. Resurrection life brings us into the kingship with Christ because it proceeds out of the throne of God. The throne of God signifies authority. We see a picture of this in Revelation 22:1 where the water of life issues out of the throne of God. Therefore, authority and life are mutually related. The river of life is related to the throne of God. If we have the throne of God as our source, we will be in the water of life. If we are in the water of life, it will bring us to the throne of God, giving us the authority that proceeds from His throne. Life brings authority. We all must see that representing God requires God's life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2.  The First Step&#151;Creating Man as a Vessel<br>to Contain God as Life</H2><P>The first step of God's procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to create man as a vessel to contain Himself as life. I like this word vessel. Do you realize that as a human being you are a vessel? A vessel is like a bottle or a cup. Today, while I was with the Lord, I was rejoicing because I am a vessel. I said to myself, "Man, you are exactly like a bottle. Your mouth resembles the mouth of a bottle. The purpose of a bottle is to contain something, not to contain yourself. You are a vessel designed to contain God."</P><P>This is not my concept. It was presented initially in Genesis and then stated emphatically by Paul in Romans 9 when he said, "Who are you, trying to argue with God? Don't you realize that you are clay? The potter has sovereign authority to mold the clay into vessels." Romans 9:21, 23 reveals that God created man as a vessel. We are vessels to contain God as life.</P><P>Therefore, after God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life. The tree of life was good for food. In John 6 the Lord Jesus said that He was edible, that He was the bread of life (John 6:35). Therefore, we all can eat Him. Furthermore, we contain whatever we eat because it comes into our being. Our being is simply a vessel to contain everything we eat. Whatever we eat is not only contained in us, but is assimilated into our very element. It even becomes us. Therefore, dietitians say, "You are what you eat." We are not only containing vessels; we are eating vessels, vessels that assimilate what we eat. God is desirous of being eaten by us. If we tell God that we want to eat Him, He will be very happy. We are His eating and assimilating vessels. Eventually, God will become us. Praise the Lord! We were made vessels to contain God as life.</P><P>Romans 9:21, 23 tells us that we are vessels unto honor, vessels of mercy prepared unto glory. This is our portion. Do not look down on me. I am a vessel unto honor, not dishonor. One day I will be filled with glory and I will be in glory to express the God of glory. We all are vessels of mercy prepared unto glory.</P>
