   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CORPORATE LIVING OF THE CONFORMITY TO THE DEATH OF CHRIST THROUGH THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Philippians 3 Paul said that he lived a life conformed to the death of Christ v. 10 . The death of Christ is a mold, and Paul put himself into that death-mold to be conformed there.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On this man, Paul, all men could see the mark and the image of the cross Gal 6:14, 17 see note 171 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His old life was conformed to the image of the death of Christ by the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The power of resurrection strengthened him to live the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord expects that many of us would be such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do believe that among us there should be some like this, maybe not constantly but at least instantly like this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can testify to you that I am like this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I dare not say constantly, but at least instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times when I was trying to talk to my wife, something within said, "This is not from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is from your old man."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Right away I stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes I would go to her, and then right away I returned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because my going was by my natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While I was doing that, something within turned me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was the very life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The processed Triune God turned me, and that was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a corporate living is the reality of the Body of Christ, dear saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a corporate living of the conformity to the death of Christ through the power of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE MINGLING LIVING, IN THE ETERNAL UNION, OF THE REGENERATED, TRANSFORMED, AND GLORIFIED TRIPARTITE GOD-MEN WITH THE TRIUNE GOD IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reality of the Body of Christ is not just a corporate living, but a mingling living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we use the word mingled, this means that this living is consummated, completed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, we use the word mingling because this living is not completed; it is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the mingling living in the eternal union of the regenerated, transformed, glorified tripartite God-men with the Triune God in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This Triune God is the very pneumatic Christ as the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit as the reality of the pneumatic Christ and as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a mingling living is in the resurrection of Christ, and the reality of this resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This resurrection imparts the consummated God and releases the death-overcoming life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CONSUMMATING ULTIMATELY IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Dear saints, such a mingling living is the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If among us there is, if not in full at least in part, such a living, the reality of the Body of Christ is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the high peak of the recovery in the local churches like Mount Zion in the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a mingling living as the reality of the Body of Christ will consummate ultimately in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as God's increase and expression for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anyone who lives such a mingling life would never be a trouble to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They have been delivered out of themselves and have been transformed and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They would not despise or condemn anyone nor would they be bothered by others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They would not have anything to do with dissension, rebellion, or division.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead they would be here in the recovery as the high peak, Mount Zion, in Jerusalem.</S>
