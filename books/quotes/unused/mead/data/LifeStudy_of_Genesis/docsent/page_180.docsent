   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man Became Flesh the Fallen Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the first cause of man's third fall was the mingling of evil spirits with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us now consider the second cause.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second cause of this fall was that man had become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Genesis 6:3 says, "And the Lord said, My spirit shall not strive with man forever, for that he indeed is flesh" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first fall, man did not exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the second fall, he overexercised his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cain knew nothing about his spirit, but overexercised his soul, inventing a new religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the third fall, man abused the fallen body and became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man not only failed to care for the spirit, but did not even care about his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man neglected the intellect and reason in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people are in the same situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not care for the spirit, for the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither do they care for their soul, for their intellect or reason.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They only fear the police.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you were to remove the National Guard or the police department, the flesh would come to the surface, caring nothing for the spirit, for human intellect or for man's reason.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People would simply abuse their flesh and act nearly the same as animals.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When man is in this condition, he has almost fallen to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first fall exposes man's not using the spirit, and the second fall exposes his overuse of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of the overexercise of the soul, man fell further and began to abuse his body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, man wholly became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible reveals that the strongest and most evil enemy of God is our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We see this unveiled in the book of Romans, especially in chapters seven and eight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh is thoroughly and absolutely hated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God will not tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a sense, God may tolerate our mistakes and transgressions, but He will never tolerate the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anything that issues out of our flesh is an insult to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the time of the third fall, the entire human race became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, God stepped in and told His servant Noah that He was going to destroy that whole generation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Process</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The process is not difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first step in the process was the fulfilling of the lusts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a person becomes flesh, he has no choice but to fulfill the lusts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The result of fulfilling the lusts of the flesh is that man becomes evil and corrupt to the uttermost 6:5, 11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the Bible is very economical, not wasting any words, Genesis 6 a number of times says that the earth was corrupt and filled with violence vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the eyes of God, the earth was corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was not only evil, but corrupt to such a degree that God could not tolerate it any longer.</S>
