   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH Parts of two talks given by Brother Watchman Nee to the co-workers as trainees on Mount Kuling in the year 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first part was published in April 1949, in chapter forty-nine of Messages for Building Up New Believers, and the second part published in March 1950, in the third chapter of Church Affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the church has the proper ground outwardly and the proper content inwardly, it is still insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She must also have the service, the service of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The service of the church has been neglected through all these generations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even today we do not have an adequate realization concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The service of the church is a spiritual coordination, a coordination of the saints in life and in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the spiritual activity of the saints, who are members one of another in the Holy Spirit, as one Body, each member functioning according to its office.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not the independent movement of an individual, but the coordinated movement of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not the service of one person individually, but the serving together of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not the service of one pastor plus a preacher and several elders and deacons, but the service in which all the saints participate together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a church is normal, the number of people saved should also be the number of people serving.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the New Testament, all the saved ones are priests; therefore, all the saved ones should serve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If in a church only a minority or a part are serving, there is something wrong with that church; it is still weak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only when all are serving is the church strong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>SERVICE IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 12:14-21 says, "For the body is not one member but many.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the whole were the hearing, where would the smelling be?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And if all were one member, where would the body be?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But now the members are many, but the body one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 28 through 30 go on to say, "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are all apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are all prophets?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are all teachers?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do all have works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do all have gifts of healing?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do all speak in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do all interpret tongues?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are many members in the Body of Christ, and the Holy Spirit dispenses all kinds of gifts and ministries to them according to the need of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord grants the members different kinds of gifts and ministries for the purpose of supplying the need of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord knows that He will not make the whole Body the eyes or the whole Body the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord gives the members different gifts and ministries to supply the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the human body needs all the members, so the church needs the different kinds of gifts and ministries for its spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some serve in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some serve by performing works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some exercise the gift of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some render helps.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some speak in tongues and some interpret tongues, etc. The church must provide ample opportunity for all the brothers and sisters to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the members, including the uncomely ones, are useful in the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is impossible to have a useless member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every brother and sister is a member in the Body and every member has his or her function and service.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as you are a Christian, you are a member of the Body of Christ, and as a member in the Body, you must have your own service before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must honor such a practice of universal service.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every Christian must have his or her respective function and must serve the Lord according to this function.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every member in the church should find a place to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone should serve and there should not be any monopoly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A member or a few members should not replace all the members in doing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any system that does not provide opportunity for all the members to function is surely not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the physical body, the eyes, the mouth, the feet, and the hands may all be very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet they do not contradict each other.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Something is wrong if only the eyes function while the mouth, feet, and hands do not.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the eyes, mouth, feet, and hands all function together and coordinate as one entity, we have the body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If some serve and others do not or if only one or a few serve, we do not have the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be very clear about this principle.</S>
