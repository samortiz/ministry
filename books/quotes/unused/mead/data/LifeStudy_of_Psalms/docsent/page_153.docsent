   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Recalling the Glorious and Pleasant Past</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Leading of the Festal Multitude</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Enjoy God in His House with His People</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, the psalmist was panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, he was recalling the glorious and pleasant past in the leading of the festal multitude to enjoy God in His house with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 42:4 says, "These things I remember,/And I pour out my soul within me:/That I passed through with the throng;/I led them to the house of God/With the voice of a joyous shout and praise,/The festal multitude."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a very pleasant recounting of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I would like us to consider whether or not this was the right thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the psalmist's captivity, he was panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But at least in his thought, in his consideration, he left the panting after God and went to something else the recounting of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How good that was, how glorious that was, and how pleasant that was!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He remembered how wonderful it was when he was leading a multitude to ascend to the peak of Zion to enjoy God with God's people by feasting together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was a pleasant picture from the past, but should he have recounted his past in this way while he was panting after God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, this was a departure from his panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He should have remained in the state of panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be having a time with the Lord in which we are panting after God, but then some consideration within us will take us away from our panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We might remember how wonderful and pleasant the church life was many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This consideration and remembrance of our past distracts us from enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 42:4 is a good verse, but it shows that there is a mixture within the sentiment of the writer of this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There should be no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, there should be only panting after God and singing "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our considerations and thinking should not take us away from the panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not be distracted from God to the treasuring of our past.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the psalmist departed from his panting after God, the thoughts constituting his sentiment were expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>E. Encouraged by the Hope in God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>for the Salvation of His Countenance</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 5 says, "Why are you bowed down, O my soul?/And why are you disquieted within me?/Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him/For the salvation of His countenance."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The psalmist was encouraged by the hope in God for the salvation of His countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The psalmist encouraged his soul, himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He told his soul not to be cast down but to hope in God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said that he would still praise God for the salvation of His countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time the psalmist had been stripped of almost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had lost his home and was in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What could he enjoy?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He could enjoy the countenance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He lost his home, his country, and he had been stripped of his earthly enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now he was in captivity, but he could enjoy God's presence, God's countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's countenance became his enjoyment in his captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, while he was enjoying God's presence by panting after God, he became distracted by different thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are also like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our time with the Lord, we may be panting after Him, but then we are taken away from God by distracting thoughts.</S>
