   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Millennial Kingdom as a Time of Restoration</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10 says, "I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This refers to the millennial kingdom, which will be a time of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the millennial kingdom God will stop all the fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word concerning the kingdom surely must have been a comfort and an encouragement to the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sequence in this chapter is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 1 through 7 speak concerning the damage and devastation Alexander the Great caused to the nations surrounding Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then verse 8 continues to say that the Lord Himself encamped around His temple within the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This saved Judah with Jerusalem and the temple from the devastation of Alexander.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jerusalem and the temple were spared and saved from the devastation of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was a good deliverance and a sign of the coming restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the coming restoration needs the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, after the word in verse 8 concerning the deliverance of Jerusalem and the temple, verse 9 says that Christ is coming, being righteous and bearing salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, the situation was right and fitting for Christ's coming, and He came in humility, and also in an intimate manner, riding upon a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What should be the issue of Christ's coming?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As verse 10 indicates, after His coming peace and restoration should be here, and God's dominion should also be here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the restoration the first item is peace: "He will speak peace unto the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second item is dominion: "His dominion will be from sea to sea."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, when Christ came the first time, He was only welcomed a little and was ultimately rejected, detested to the uttermost, and put to death by being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regarding His rejection by the children of Israel, the Lord Jesus said, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Behold, your house is left to you desolate" Matt 23:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word house denotes the house of God, which was the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was the house of God, but here it is called "your house."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The house of God had become their house, and it would be utterly destroyed by Titus in A.D. 70 Matt 24:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the children of Israel rejected Christ the King, the restoration was somewhat suspended, and a time of judgment over the children of Israel entered in, which has lasted about twenty centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, Christ needs to come a second time, this time not riding a donkey but coming as lightning Matt 24:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then peace and the eternal kingdom, as God's dominion, will be on the earth from sea to sea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the sequence according to the spiritual significance.</S>
