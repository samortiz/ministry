   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 6 THE TABERNACLE 2 The Covering of the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 26:1-14 describes the four layers of the covering of the tabernacle, beginning from the inner to the outer layer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first layer was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second layer was made of eleven curtains of goats hair.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The third layer was a covering of rams skins dyed red, and the fourth layer was a covering of porpoise skins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Curtains of Fine Linen</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first layer was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1-6; 36:8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These ten curtains were divided into two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The number five signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our two hands each have five fingers, and all five fingers are needed in order to work and bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Another example is the ten virgins in Matthew 25, who are divided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Five of the virgins were foolish, and five were prudent v. 2 . The number two signifies testimony, and the number five signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the ten curtains divided into two groups of five curtains indicate that man bears responsibility before God on the ground of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most important aspect of the curtains is that they were made of fine twined linen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cherubim were embroidered upon the curtains, and in the curtains of fine twined linen there were blue and purple and scarlet strands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These curtains of fine twined linen signify humanity mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fine linen, just as fine flour, denotes the condition of the Lord Jesus as a man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fine flour signifies the fineness of the Lord Jesus humanity Lev 2:1-16 , and fine linen denotes the purity of the Lord s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cherubim signify the glory of God manifested in the Lord s pure humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Cherubim bear two significances in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every time cherubim are spoken of in the Old Testament, they are spoken of in relation to the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ezekiel 9:3 speaks of the glory of the God of Israel being upon a cherub.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Old Testament indicates that the glory of God was entrusted to and borne by the cherubim 1 Kings 8:7-11; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>10:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, cherubim are often associated with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cherubim also refer to a part of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seraphim in Isaiah 6 plus the cherubim in Ezekiel 10 compose the four living creatures in Revelation 4:6-8.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, one aspect of the significance of the cherubim is related to God s glory, and the other is related to the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, they signify God s glory manifested in His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cherubim embroidered on the curtains signify that the glory of God was manifested in the created humanity of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fine linen denotes the condition of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before being redeemed we were not like fine linen; we were rough and coarse in our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After being redeemed we now express a degree of fineness, as typified by the fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both fine linen and acacia wood refer to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fine linen mainly denotes the fineness and beauty of humanity, whereas acacia wood mainly denotes the solidness and strength of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to appreciate the strength of redeemed humanity, we need to consider the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to appreciate the beauty of redeemed humanity, we need to consider the fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The acacia wood was overlaid with gold, and the fine twined linen was embroidered with cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Gold signifies God s precious worth, and cherubim signify God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as gold covered the acacia wood, cherubim were embroidered upon the fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The acacia wood upheld the gold, and the fine linen upheld the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This signifies that God s honor and glory are upheld by redeemed humanity that is strong, heavenly, dignified, and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The boards of the tabernacle were for standing; thus, they needed to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The covering of the tabernacle was for the expression of glory, and as such, it needed to be fine and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This can be compared to the ceiling of a house, which is mainly for appearance rather than support.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, in the first layer is seen the strength and beauty of humanity and the glory of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The strength and beauty of humanity are typified by the fine linen, and the glory of divinity is typified by the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fine linen denotes the condition of our humanity, the blue strands signify our heavenly condition, the purple strands signify our kingly position, and the scarlet strands signify our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, the cherubim, representing God s glory, were upheld by the fine linen, because the cherubim were embroidered upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gold and cherubim denote divinity, and acacia wood and fine linen denote humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This typifies the church as the matching and mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When a priest entered into the tabernacle, he saw acacia wood overlaid with gold and fine linen embroidered with cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When people come to the church, they should see divinity upheld by humanity, that is, gold and cherubim upheld by acacia wood and fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be proper, the church must match God with a strong and beautiful humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The condition of the church before God should be that of a curtain of fine linen with blue, purple, and scarlet strands embroidered with cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Fine linen signifies the Lord being both pure and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord is both pure and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Blue signifies a heavenly condition, purple denotes a kingly position, scarlet signifies redemption, and cherubim indicate God s glory being manifested in His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The most appealing aspect of this layer of the covering of the tabernacle was the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The strands of blue, purple, and scarlet were not as attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The most charming item was the embroidered cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that the most striking aspect of the church should be God s glory manifested in His creatures who have been redeemed and who are pure, righteous, heavenly, and in a royal position.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These people manifest God s glory, as signified by the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This should be the condition of the church before God.</S>
