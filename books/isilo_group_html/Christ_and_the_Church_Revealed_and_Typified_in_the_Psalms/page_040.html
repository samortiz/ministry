Immediately after I was saved, I was encouraged to memorize Psalm 1. It was very easy for me to understand this one. After a number of years in the Word of God, I learned to summarize passages and divide the Word into paragraphs and sections. That came easily. But when I encountered Psalm 68, I could not summarize it, neither could I divide it into sections. Most of the time I passed over it and neglected it. It was too difficult for me. Nevertheless, though I neglected it, the Lord could not forget it. Praise the Lord, now we are in Psalm 68. I have always been so happy in recent months to stay in this Psalm. I am not afraid of it anymore. I love Psalm 68. I would testify that today I am on top of this Psalm, I am on the peak.<p>We will see that in this Psalm we have firstly Christ, secondly the house, thirdly the city, Jerusalem, and fourthly the earth. But we do not have the law. The law has been left behind; the law has been dropped. When we come to the highest peak of all the Psalms, we only have Christ in the house within the city for the whole earth. These are the four key words of Psalm 68-Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. If we would understand this Psalm, and indeed all the Psalms, we must understand these four words. The whole book of the Psalms is found in miniature in Psalm 68. By now we have already laid the foundation for this Psalm. Before we have come to the peak, we have already glimpsed it. We have seen Christ, we have seen the house, we have seen the city, and we have seen the earth. We have such a foundation. Now it is easy for us to understand Psalm 68.<p>We may briefly define this Psalm by saying that it tells us how, in God&#8217;s move on the earth, Christ ascended to the heavens and as a man received gifts from God for the building of God&#8217;s dwelling place. The building up of God&#8217;s house is for the expansion of the city, and the expansion of the city is for Christ&#8217;s reigning over the entire earth. Christ has conquered all His enemies, He has won the victory, He has led captive a train of vanquished foes, He has ascended and been exalted to the highest place in the universe, and He has received gifts for building up the house of God. This house is for the city, and the city is for the whole earth. Now you have Psalm 68. Without these points, though you may read this Psalm one hundred times, you will never comprehend it. But we must look into these matters in further detail. We may say that this Psalm presents us with nine major points.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD&#8217;S MOVING ON THIS EARTH</h2><p>To properly understand Psalm 68, we must be acquainted with the background of its composition. It is God&#8217;s moving on this earth in His tabernacle. In ancient times God moved on this earth among the people of Israel. He moved with them from Egypt to the wilderness and into the good land. His moving was not in the heavens, but on this earth. He rode through the wilderness, through the desert, not through the skies. All God&#8217;s moving at that time was related to the tabernacle, within which was the ark. The tabernacle in typology signifies God&#8217;s dwelling place, and the ark represents Christ. Hence, God was moving on the earth in and through His dwelling place with Christ as the center. We must be clear concerning these three points: (1) God is moving on the earth, (2) God&#8217;s move was in and with the tabernacle, and (3) God&#8217;s move was with Christ as the center in the tabernacle. Psalm 68 was written with this background. It is an exact portrayal of the situation with God&#8217;s move on the earth today. God is moving on this earth, He is moving in and through His church, and He is moving with Christ as the center of the church.<p>Verse 1 says, &#8220;Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.&#8221; This is a quotation of Numbers 10:35, &#8220;And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.&#8221; Psalm 68:1 was the word spoken by Moses. When God set out to move with the ark, Moses said, &#8220;Rise up, Lord.&#8221; Now Moses&#8217; word is quoted by David: &#8220;Let God arise.&#8221; Hence, we see that the background of this Psalm is the move of God in His tabernacle with the ark.<p>The move of God on this earth is not only the background of Psalm 68, but also the first thought. In addition to verse 1, there are other verses which speak most expressively of God&#8217;s move. Verse 4 in the best translation reads, &#8220;Triumph in him that rideth through the deserts,&#8221; not, as in the King James Version, &#8220;him that rideth upon the heavens.&#8221; He is not riding through the skies, but through the wilderness, through the deserts of this earth. The entire earth today is a desert, a wilderness; yet God is riding through and moving on. Do not be disappointed; triumph in Him, in Him who is riding through the desert. The desert means nothing to Him; He is riding through it. Have you seen this? &#8220;His name is JAH; and exult before him.&#8221; Verses 7 and 8 continue the thought of God&#8217;s move: &#8220;O God...thou wentest forth before thy people...thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah.&#8221; The first point of this Psalm is that God is moving on this earth.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
