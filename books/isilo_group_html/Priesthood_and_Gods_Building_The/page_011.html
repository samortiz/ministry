INTO GOD&rsquo;S FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Whenever God is engaged in building, He needs the priesthood to coordinate with the kingship. The fellowship of the priesthood must be coordinated with the authority of the kingship. Hence, in order to build the temple, the Lord Jesus also has the office of the priesthood. The kingship brings God&rsquo;s authority to man, and the priesthood brings man into God&rsquo;s fellowship. If there is only the kingship without the priesthood, God&rsquo;s authority may be exercised over man without bringing man into God&rsquo;s fellowship.</p>
<p>When the high priest went before God&rsquo;s presence in the Old Testament, he bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on the breastplate (Exo. 28:29). This means that he brought God&rsquo;s children to contact God and that he also brought them into God&rsquo;s fellowship to know God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. According to the New Testament, the Lord Jesus is both King and Priest. In addition to the Lord, Peter, John, and James also expressed the matters of kingly authority and priestly fellowship. God&rsquo;s authority was truly carried out through them to the saints in the church. At the same time, they also brought the saints into God&rsquo;s fellowship. In the early years of the New Testament age, there was a coordination of the priesthood and the kingship for the building of the church through the Lord Jesus and His disciples.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING REGULARLY TO ENTER<br />
INTO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h2>
<p>When a person submits to God, he receives kingly authority. However, priestly fellowship requires a person to daily live in God. In order for a person to receive and submit to the authority in the church, he needs to be dealt with and fundamentally subdued by God only once. With such a dealing, he will have a clear sense of any lack of submission in his being from that time forward. However, in order to experience the priestly fellowship in the church, he needs to fellowship with God daily in his spirit. Fellowshipping with God in the spirit does not refer only to individual fellowship with God; it refers even more to our fellowship with God in the church. Even our fellowship with the church, however, is not a matter between just us and the church; rather, when we fellowship with the church, we also fellowship with God in the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p>In order to have this kind of fellowship, we must pray. The book of Acts often speaks of the apostles and the disciples praying. The apostles spoke of continuing steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word (6:4). They prayed because they were priests. If a priest does not go to the Holy Place to burn incense and pray before God, he is not fulfilling his priestly duty. If those who are taking the lead in the church, administrating in the church, and even building the church do not offer adequate prayers to God, they are not fulfilling their responsibility as a priest.</p>
<p>Hence, the elders who are leading the brothers and sisters in the local churches should have the aspect of kingly authority, but even more, they should have the aspect of priestly fellowship. Only when they fellowship with God and spend time in prayer, allowing their spirits to come forth and be mutually blended, will they be able to lead the saints into an atmosphere of prayer. This, in turn, will fill the church with prayer and fellowship, and there will be a convergence of the kingship and the priesthood among the brothers and sisters. This corresponds to 1 Peter 2:5, which speaks of the saints being living stones, who are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. The living stones that are being built up refer to the priesthood. However, this priesthood is also a royal priesthood (v. 9). Hence, these two offices, the kingship and the priesthood, have not only been combined in the Lord Jesus but also in those who are being built up together. In God&rsquo;s building there is the kingly authority as well as the priestly fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE BALANCE<br />
BETWEEN FELLOWSHIP AND AUTHORITY<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Throughout the centuries there have always been situations involving imbalance between fellowship and authority in the church. Those who feel that there is too much organization in the church insist on the need to fellowship, pray, and draw near to God, but they have no regard for authority. Such ones lean toward the aspect of fellowship. It is as if they see only the matter of being a priest but not the matter of being a royal priest. With them there is an emphasis on the priesthood and spirituality but not on the kingship. Still others place too much stress on the aspect of authority and order. Such ones feel that the church represents God and that the church involves God&rsquo;s deputy authority. Hence, they focus on matters related to position, order, and authority in the church, but they neglect the aspect of fellowship. As a result, it is easy for the church to fall into a situation of having outward authority and order among the elders, co-workers, and serving ones but with no expression of priestly fellowship. As a consequence, the saints do not touch the Lord, do not have a praying spirit, and do not have mutual fellowship in spirit. This shows that there is a serious imbalance. If we want to be involved in the building of the church, based on the mercy and the light that we have received from God, we must balance the kingship with the priesthood, and we must balance authority with fellowship. Just as the offices of the kingship and the priesthood have converged in the Lord Jesus as the Builder, there should be a coordination of kingly authority and priestly fellowship within the living stones who are being built up.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
