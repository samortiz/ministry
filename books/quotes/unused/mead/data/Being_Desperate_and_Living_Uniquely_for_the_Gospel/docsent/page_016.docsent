   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYER FOR THE FILLING OF BOTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE ESSENTIAL AND ECONOMICAL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 11:24 refers to the inward filling of the essential Spirit, and Acts 4:31 refers to the outward filling of the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Acts 11 Barnabas was one filled with the Holy Spirit essentially and inwardly, so many people turned to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts 4 the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly and economically, so they spoke the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be filled essentially and economically with the Spirit always requires a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to admit we are all sinful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are regenerated, but we are in the body, in the flesh, and are still living on this earth with many dirty things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Physically speaking, how many times do you wash your hands?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A doctor told us that doctors get sick less because they exercise to wash their hands frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you want to avoid sickness, you had better wash your hands twelve times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to make a thorough confession many times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may have had the filling of the Spirit, but your long face to your wife spoiled it, so you have to make a thorough confession to get yourself adjusted, to get yourself cleansed, to get yourself right with a right atmosphere; then you will once again enjoy the filling of the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do this all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of your prayers may only be for good jobs, good cars, or a good education.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those prayers make your person dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Forget about that.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Use twenty minutes every day to make a thorough confession: "Lord, cleanse my mind, cleanse my thinking, cleanse my emotion, cleanse my loving of anything other than You.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, cleanse my will, my decision, my intention."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Get yourself fully cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You will surely have the Spirit filling you up inwardly, essentially, and outwardly, economically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOING WITH THE AUTHORITY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you have the previous five points, you are surely equipped, qualified, and ready to go with the power and the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To go to knock on doors means that you command the door to open.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes you have to say, "Door, I knock; you open."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the man is there, give the commandment, not verbally but silently "Man, listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me in."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While you are reading The Mystery of Human Life, tell the angels and demons that you are reading to this one with the authority of the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many trainees in Taipei experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were surprised that the people were like lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They follow your directions to believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the past when we talked to people, we did not have this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We did not exercise the very right we have been given.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We had no intention to exercise our authority to command them to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, we would tell the new ones that they could wait to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We gave up our right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Where was your authority to baptize new ones immediately into the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many of the trainees can testify that baptizing the new ones immediately after they received the Lord really worked and really made people happy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It changes people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a Buddhist home, after the parents got baptized, with the little children standing by, they said to the idols of Buddha, "Buddha, we have Jesus now.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We don't want you, and we don't need you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to go."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the parents did away with the idols in the children's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We go out with a position.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are the ambassadors sent by Him with authority to get people 2 Cor 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you go out like this, all the demons will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Devil will be gone, leaving the person under your hand just like a lamb.</S>
