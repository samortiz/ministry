The Lord needs a new way because Christianity presents us something different from what is revealed in the New Testament
In Matthew 28 the Lord charged His disciples to go to disciple the nations and teach them whatever they were taught
Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we come together, each one of us should have something of the Lord to share with others
In 1964, the Southern Baptist denomination, besides the Catholic church, was the biggest denomination in the United States
The Catholic church today has about fifty-two million members, and the Southern Baptists have about fourteen and a half million
Although the Southern Baptists increased by four million, their rate of increase since 1964 has only been about 1
Of this approximately one hundred ten million about sixty-five million were Protestants, and forty-five million were Catholics
There are many preachers and evangelistic campaigns, and there are reports that many thousands of people made a decision for Christ
Their function, their ability, their Christian capacity, has been annulled, killed, by today's practice in Christianity
Do you like to go to a big meeting in a big hall with a good facade where thousands are sitting together with a good, eloquent speaker?
There should be a proper noise where everyone speaks, everyone prays, everyone praises, and everyone gives thanks
Outside of the hall, we were not that silent, but when we got to the door and walked in the hall, we became silent
We are dealing with a living One, praising a living One, thanking a living One, and walking together with a living One
Our Christian style of worship and of practicing the church life was not built by the Spirit according to the Word
Also the church must have a big meeting with a good choir and with a good, eloquent speaker to stir up people's interest
In the small meetings in the homes, and even in a big meeting when the entire church comes together, everybody should function
We have found out that in the new home meetings of newly baptized believers it is so easy for them to function
They are so active in their homes, but in the church meeting, they feel they need to be formal, silent, and passive
Another brother in the United States who had not brought anyone to the Lord in five years baptized fifteen by going out to knock on doors
You also have to learn to know the church in a full way by having the practice of the church life in a practical way in the homes
We have finished the study of the first step in Taiwan, that is, to knock on doors to get people to believe and be baptized
The truth will become their life supply, and they will grow in life that they may have the full measure of Christ
What has delayed the Lord from coming back thus far has been the practical degradation of today's Christianity
Some preach the gospel with positive thinking, telling others that they have to believe that they will be successful in their business
To tell people that if they believe, they will go to a heavenly mansion prepared for them when they die is a superstitious teaching
She was saved and baptized many years before at hall one in Taipei, but the husband did not believe in having to go to the meetings
In the first home, the husband, wife, and a visitor were saved and baptized, and a home training was set up within thirty minutes
The whole household, including this brother's gospel team, were really beside themselves, rejoicing and dancing before the Lord!
We trained the trainees in Taipei to do two things: 1) They had to follow all the instructions of the training
All of us need to bring this fellowship to the Lord and pray that He would show us what He wants to do today on this earth
Also, all the churches should practice to have one out of four saints who would go out to knock on doors once a week for two to three hours
The five jobdropping fulltimers can gain two hundred sixty within a year and the twentyfive weekly door knockers can gain one hundred fifty
If half of this amount is discounted, the church would still have a one hundred percent increase of solid, living, remaining ones
The Lord said that all the authority in heaven and on earth had been given to Him, so He charged us to go and disciple the nations
In the last ten years, due to the defamation of some books, the rate of our increase has been just about three percent
Because of our experience and the encouraging statistics, we expect to evangelize the entire island of Taiwan within five years
The full-time trainees now have to endeavor to take care of the newly baptized ones and the newly established home meetings
If we take this way, the Lord will have a living testimony, not a church life in big halls but the church life practiced in many homes
Every home will become a station of the gospel, a station of the truth, a station of life, and a station of the church life
Many of the new ones the Lord has gained in these homes began to knock on doors immediately and spread the gospel to their relatives
