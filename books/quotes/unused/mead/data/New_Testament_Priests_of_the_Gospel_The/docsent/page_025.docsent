   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-6; Acts 9:32; 1 Tim 1:16; Rom 15:16; 12:1-2; Col 1:28-29; Rev 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet 2:9, 5; Luke 10:1-6; John 15:16 OUTLINE The turn from the Old Testament priests to the New Testament priests: The turn in John the Baptist: Though he can be considered the last priest of the Old Testament, he rejected that priesthood and turned away from being such a priest Matt 3:1-4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He turned to become the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament: He did not offer bulls and goats as offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, he offered the repentant sinners gained through him as offerings Matt 3:5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Continuing through the apostles and every believer: With the apostles taking the lead to be the New Testament priests of the gospel, preaching the gospel extensively Acts 9:32.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the Apostle Paul as a pattern 1 Tim 1:16: He was a New Testament priest of the gospel, preaching the gospel to save people and offering them to God as offerings Rom 15:16.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It being for the preaching of the gospel, the telling out of the virtues of God s salvation, saving people to offer them to God as spiritual sacrifices 1 Pet 2:9, 5.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way for the New Testament priests of the gospel to fulfill their duty: As a New Testament priest of the gospel, every believer must personally preach the gospel by visiting people through knocking on doors, saving sinners and offering them up to God as offerings Luke 10:1-6.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As branches of the vine, being sent forth to bear fruit; this being a work not to be replaced by others labor John 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This being the way ordained by God and revealed in the Bible: To be God s New Testament priest of the gospel, one must personally save the sinners and offer them to God.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I had not paid attention to this term before either.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have heard many people preaching and have read many spiritual books, but I never heard, nor did I notice this term.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was not until March of this year, while I fellowshipped with the elders in Taipei, that the Holy Spirit enlightened me to see what Paul said in Romans 15:16 concerning being a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God.</S>
