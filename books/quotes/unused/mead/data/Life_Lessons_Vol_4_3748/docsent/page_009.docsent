   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON FORTY-ONE JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Justification is a key item in God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After obtaining the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing away of sins, and after being sanctified, we have no further problems before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God then has the position and the ground to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is another crucial link in our enjoyment of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 For the showing forth of His righteousness... that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus Rom 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible, justification means that God, according to His righteousness, declares man righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, God justifies man according to the standard of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 ...shall be justified before Him God Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s justification is in two aspects, the objective and the subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Objective justification is our being justified positionally according to the righteousness which we received from God Phil 3:9 ; it is our being justified by having Christ as our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We obtain this justification by reason of the following four items:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. By the Grace of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 Being justified freely by His God s grace Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man s being justified by God is, first, by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s justifying us by His grace is His freely fulfilling all His righteous requirements for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This justification can be accepted and received by everyone without human effort and without price; therefore, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. Through the Redemption of Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 Being justified...through the redemption in Christ Jesus Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God can justify us by His grace through the redemption of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apart from the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus on the cross to accomplish redemption for us and to satisfy God s righteous requirement, there is no ground and no way for God to justify us by His grace, even if He desires to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, because on the cross the Lord Jesus shed His precious blood, paid the price, and satisfied all the requirements of God s righteousness upon us Rom 5:9 , God is able to justify us by His grace according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. Through Our Faith in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1 Yet knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man is justified by God not only by God s grace and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, but also through his faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both the grace of God and the redemption of Christ Jesus are on God s side, whereas the faith in Jesus Christ is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By His grace, and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, God would justify us and can justify us; yet for us to be justified by God, there is still the need of our faith in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>D. Proven by the Resurrection and</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ascension of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1 Who Jesus ...was raised because of our justification Rom 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The resurrection of Christ is a proof of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The death of Christ satisfied God s righteous requirements that God may justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ s resurrection is God s justification and approval of His work; hence, it is also a proof of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2 ...concerning righteousness, because I Christ go to the Father John 16:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ s ascension to the Father in heaven after He was resurrected is also a proof of our justification, even as the third stanza of Hymns, #20 says:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Father God, Thou hast accepted</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus as our Substitute;</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Judged the Just One for the unjust,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a proof of perfect justice,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At Thine own right hand He sits;</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He, as Thy full satisfaction,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Righteously Thy need befits.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ s resurrection, ascension, and being seated at the right hand of God are a proof of our justification by God, confirming that God has justified us because of Christ s death, which satisfied God s righteous requirements.</S>
