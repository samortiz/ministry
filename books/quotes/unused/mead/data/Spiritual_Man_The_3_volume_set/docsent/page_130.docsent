   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our purpose is to be a spiritual man, not a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This distinction will prevent our spiritual life from becoming one-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are men, and will be men forever, but the highest attainment of being a man is to be a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Angels are spirits, and not men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have no body and no soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man has a soul and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are to be spiritual men, not spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we still have a soul and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A "spiritual man" is not a person who only has a spirit, with no soul and no body; in that case he would be a spirit and not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Being a "spiritual man" simply means man is subject to the rule of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spirit is the highest part of the whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should pay considerable attention to this point; otherwise, we will misunderstand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The functions and faculties of man's soul and body are not cancelled because a man is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A spiritual man still has a soul and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A spiritual man still has the will, mind, and emotion of his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though these are various parts of the soul-life, these functions are the essentials of man being man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, although the spiritual man does not live by them, he does not destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, they have died, been renewed, and are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, they are now completely united with the spirit to be the instruments to express the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The spiritual man does have an emotion, mind, and will, but they are completely subject to the guidance of the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spiritual man has an emotion, but his emotion does not act independently as it once did; it is completely under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now his emotion no longer has its own likes, its own love, and its own feelings which once impeded the spirit and opposed every move of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now it only likes what the spirit likes, only loves what the spirit chooses, and only feels what the spirit allows.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spirit is its life, and it responds at once to the move of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The spiritual man also has a mind, but his mind is not as loose as it once was; it co-works with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mind does not oppose the revelation of the spirit by its reasons and arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It does not disturb the quietness in the spirit by confusing thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not boast in its own wisdom and disobey the revelation of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is of the same mind as the spirit and cooperates with the spirit to go forward in the spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the spirit has a revelation, it will think through its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the spirit is "depressed" because of fighting, it will support the spirit to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the spirit wants to teach some truth, it will help the spirit to think and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spirit has the power to stop the mind's thoughts and also has the power to make the mind think.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The spiritual man also has his will, but his will is not as self-centered as it once was; it is not independent toward God but rather obeys or refuses according to the yes or no of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It no longer has its own will nor disobeys God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is no longer hard and unable to be softened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is completely broken; it no longer resists God, no longer works against God, and no longer is wild and difficult to harness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as it has the spirit's revelation and understands God's will, it will, on behalf of the spirit, decide to follow as if it is the spirit's minister, standing at the spirit's door and waiting for the spirit's order.</S>
