   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Once in the wilderness, there were four thousand people following Jesus, not including women and children, and it was late in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What did the Lord say to the disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said, "I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat" Matt 15:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does "and" indicate?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It indicates that the Lord had not eaten for three days either.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why it says "and they do not have anything to eat."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It would have been very legitimate for the Lord to send His disciples to buy food when He had nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But He was more concerned about their not having eaten for three days than He was about His not having eaten for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Lord had cared for His own eating, then at Pentecost there would have been a few more Ananiases and Sapphiras who would have withheld certain portions for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the sake of His disciples, the Lord sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was restricted not only in His physical body, but He was restricted also spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How He suffered!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, brothers who are more advanced in the Lord and who have learned more lessons, have had more experiences, have a keener conscience, and know God more clearly, will not do many things that they would otherwise have the liberty to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although these things are altogether lawful and not sinful, they would not do them for the sake of the younger brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, many times I have felt this suffering when I stayed with young brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One may need more rest because of his physical weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fearing that this may lead others to become lazy, he does not rest as much as necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he loses sleep at night, he should be able to rise up a little later.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But for the sake of the weaker brothers who would also rise up late and miss their morning prayer and Scripture reading, he suffers and rises up early.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He may have a stomach problem and should be more selective in his eating.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in so doing it may cause the younger ones to be choosy in what they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, he does not eat as he should.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of sanctifying for the sake of others is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a mother with four sons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of her four sons loved to drink and they almost exhausted the family's money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day the mother told a preacher about this matter and he asked her, "Do you drink?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She said, "I always drink a little wine during each meal but never to the extent of getting drunk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My husband also drinks a little."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The preacher said, "If you cannot give up your drinking, you should not expect your sons to give up theirs."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Indeed, if parents have just a little craving, their children's craving will be many times stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If parents smoke cigarettes, the children will smoke opium.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If parents watch movies, the children may possibly become movie stars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord wants His disciples to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason He sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He left a pattern for us to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to follow His footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did not need to be restricted, yet He was restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the sake of His disciples, He sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you realize how much the Lord suffered and how much He was restricted when He was living with His disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was tired more than His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was hungry more than His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He needed rest more than His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet He never left them except when He was alone on the mountain praying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was the same as the disciples in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the very end, His disciples could not point out any flaw in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All His disciples testified that He was without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Peter said that He was without blemish and spot, that no guile was found in His mouth, and that He committed no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who lived with Him knew His heart the best, and this was the testimony of one who had lived with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But for the sake of His disciples, He sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should also be the same at home, in school, and among the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God has put us here in order that we may be a shining light in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must pass through strippings and bondages.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, we cannot expect others to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must sanctify ourselves for the sake of others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today we have seen the Lord and the excellency of His footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us follow His footsteps.</S>
