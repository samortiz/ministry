        <h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO COOPERATE WITH THE LORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Revived Living and an Overcoming Life</h2>
<p>If we desire to take the way of recovery, we must cooperate with the Lord. First, we must have a revived living and an overcoming life. As believers, we must have a revived living. To be revived is to be enlivened within and to live solely for the Lord. Such a revival will lead us to live an overcoming life. In Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord said seven times that we need to overcome all the negative situations and have an overcoming living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pray-reading the Word<br />
and Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s Name Daily</h2>
<p>Second, we need to live a life of daily pray-reading the Word and calling on His name to enjoy His riches (Col. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:22; Rom. 10:12). This must be our practice in our daily life. It is regrettable that we have neglected this. We often do not read the Word for several days, nor do we pray-read. We should read the Word daily and also pray-read the Word by turning the Word into prayer. Then the Word will become living to us and will be our food (Jer. 15:16). Reading the Word may be a mental process, but once we turn the Word into prayer, we will receive the supply of life. In addition, we need to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, but many of us may not call for a number of days. We should call on the Lord every day and in everything (Eph. 5:20). Sometimes while I am writing an article, I call on the Lord from deep within. Then I am inwardly supplied and able to enjoy the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing Christ<br />
by Continually Being Filled in Spirit,<br />
Walking according to the Spirit,<br />
and Living Christ</h2>
<p>Third, we also need to be filled in spirit, walk according to the spirit, and live Christ continually so that we may experience Christ (v. 18; Gal. 5:16, 25; Phil. 1:20-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Ready in Season and out of Season<br />
to Testify for the Lord, to Speak Christ,<br />
and to Proclaim the Gospel Everywhere</h2>
<p>Fourth, wherever we are, whether in season or out of season, we should testify for the Lord, speak Christ, and proclaim the gospel (2 Tim. 4:2). This should be manifested in our living throughout the day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Increasing Our Spiritual Constitution</h2>
<p>Fifth, we should increase our spiritual constitution daily through spiritual exercises and learning. I would again propose that we use ten to fifteen minutes every morning to pray-read two verses from the Bible. It is best to do this with two or three others. Husbands and wives are the best companions for pray-reading. This kind of pray-reading is a surety, a disinfectant, and an antitoxin. If a couple can read two Bible verses together every morning, it will be very easy for them to live in the spirit the rest of the day, and they can avoid quarrelling with one another. As a result, they will have some spiritual constitution.</p>
<p>In addition to pray-reading, we need to speak to whomever we meet, whether in season or out of season. This is also a good way to be constituted spiritually. If we can increase our spiritual constitution every day, we will spontaneously supply others in large meetings and in small meetings. Such a living will make it possible for 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 to be recovered among us and for Matthew 16:18 and Ephesians 4:12-16 to be fulfilled for the building up of the church, which is the Body of Christ and the organism of the Triune God. The church can be built up only through meetings in mutuality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>In order to change the system for everyone to function and for the building up of the church, we need to be revived. On the one hand, we do not need to wait for a revival. As long as we are willing to receive grace, we can be revived. On the other hand, being revived requires that we take the initiative to obtain grace. First, we must be determined to live for the Lord. Then we need to consecrate ourselves to set aside a specific time to go out every week either to visit people, to preach the gospel, or to lead a home meeting. Finally, we need spiritual exercises every day so that we can have spiritual experiences and be enriched in our spirit to increase our spiritual constitution. As a result, we will have something with which to supply others when we come to the meeting.</p>
<p>Husbands and wives should pray-read two Bible verses together. Then they will live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit. They should also speak the Lord, proclaim the gospel, and testify of the Lord to whomever they meet. This will increase their spiritual constitution so that whether in large meetings or in small meetings, it will not be difficult for them to speak. If we have such a living, spontaneously some will call hymns, some will pray, and some will teach. After the meeting different ones will share. The result of practicing mutuality is that we grow in life and build up the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
