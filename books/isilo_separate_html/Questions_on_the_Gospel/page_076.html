The gospel of God always draws forth hallelujahs. God is holy. Holiness is the highest expression of God&#8217;s glory. If we are anything less than holy, we cannot be in God&#8217;s presence. But we are as holy as Christ is when we are in Him. We can come before God because God sees us in the same way that He sees Christ. Thank God, the salvation of Jesus Christ is complete and eternal. If it were not complete, God&#8217;s righteousness would not be upon us. If it were not eternal, we would not be separated and sanctified unto God eternally. But the salvation of Jesus Christ is complete and eternal (Heb. 10:14). Therefore, we can obtain eternal forgiveness, be sanctified unto God, and remain forever in God&#8217;s presence.<p>&#8220;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:2). Paul wrote this letter to those in Corinth who were sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints. We are not going to be saints, because when we were called, we were already saints sanctified unto God. Once we are called and saved, we are sanctified in Christ and are called saints.<p>What kind of believers were the Corinthians? They ate and drank their own food before they partook of the Lord&#8217;s supper, so that while they were overly filled or even drunk, others came in hungry (1 Cor. 11:20-22). Yet Paul acknowledged that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus and were &#8220;called saints.&#8221; Moreover, gross sin had been committed among them, even the taking of one&#8217;s stepmother (5:1). Yet Paul still said that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus. They were boastful; nonetheless, Paul still said that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus. Therefore, sanctification in the Bible does not refer to outward behavior. Sanctification is different from what is spoken of Romans 5-8. What is mentioned there is the fruit of sanctification and not sanctification itself. Romans says that no one should be a slave to sin but that everyone should offer his members as slaves to righteousness and bear the fruit of sanctification (6:13, 17-22). Our sanctification is based upon the fact that when Jesus Christ died, He joined us to Himself. This is sanctification. The tree and the fruit of the tree are different. The tree is the tree, and the fruit is the fruit. Similarly, sanctification and the fruit of sanctification are different. Sanctification is one thing, and the fruit of it is another. The believers at Corinth had the position of sanctification, but they did not yet bear the fruit of sanctification. Therefore, Paul rebuked them in his letter and showed them that since they had the position of sanctification, they should also bear the fruit of sanctification (2 Cor. 7:1).<p>&#8220;But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:30). This verse says that Christ Jesus became our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Just as Christ Jesus is righteous and sanctified before God, we are righteous and sanctified in Christ. Our sanctification before God cannot be any less than that of Christ Jesus. Praise God that our sanctification before God is not because of our righteous behavior or experience of Christ; it is because Christ has become our sanctification before God, and His sanctification has become our sanctification.<p>&#8220;And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:11). According to this passage, sanctification comes before justification. We were sanctified and justified. Paul said that we have already been sanctified and justified. Do you have sanctification and justification yet? If you ask a Christian if he has been justified, he will boldly say yes. If you ask him if he is a righteous person, he may dare to answer yes. But if you ask him if he is a saint, he will most likely not dare to say yes. But the Bible tells us that we are already sanctified. God has not only forgiven our sins and justified us, but He also reckons us as worthy, as being saints because of the Lord Jesus Christ. In God&#8217;s eyes, we are qualified and worthy. However, when our eyes are turned to ourselves, we lose the enjoyment of this relationship.<p>&#8220;By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all&#8221; (Heb. 10:10). Our sanctification is based on Jesus Christ offering His own body. He did it once, and it was accomplished forever. &#8220;For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified&#8221; (v. 14). Thank God that our sanctification is because of Christ and is perfected forever. Some are afraid to come to God because they sense their filthiness. Indeed, we are filthy, easily contaminated, unchaste, and unfaithful to God. But we are holy because of Christ and not because of our own work. Since Christ offered His own body once, we are sanctified forever, and our position before God is holy. Whenever we stand on this position and come to God through Christ, God sees us as holy in Christ and accepts us as He has accepted Christ.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> </body></html>
