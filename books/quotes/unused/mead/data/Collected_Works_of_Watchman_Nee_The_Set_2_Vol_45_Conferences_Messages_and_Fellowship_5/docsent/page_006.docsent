   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Gen 25:5-6, 11; 26:5-6, 23-24</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses show us that as far as God's purpose was concerned, Abraham was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as far as God's work was concerned, Abraham was not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was the need of Isaac and Jacob before the work could be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The God of Abraham" shows that God is the Father and that man's natural constitution and the flesh need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the blessings that God gave Isaac were blessings that He had promised to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham did not receive these blessings; Isaac received them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He inherited all the blessings which God promised to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Isaac we see clearly two things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, we see the inheriting of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to have the kingdom, we must pass through Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham was the father, and he had to learn to know God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaac was the son.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament only Isaac was not born of the flesh; he was born of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament only Christ was not born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both Isaac and Christ are only begottens, both were offered up as sacrifices, and both were resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, Isaac's life and experience were very ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did not do anything extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was the son, and he was obedient in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he was being offered up as a sacrifice, he did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He only asked his father: "Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gen 22:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Abraham tied him up, he did not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Abraham placed him on the altar, he did not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Abraham asked him to come down from the altar, he came down.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was not married until he was forty years old, and the marriage was arranged by his father through an old servant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He happily accepted this marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Isaac did not propose anything and made no suggestions of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By the time he was sixty, he had two sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the famine years he went to Gerar and said that his wife was his sister.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The lie he told was a repetition of his father's lie.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Philistines covered up his well, he did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After he died, he was buried in his father's tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Isaac lived a very ordinary life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Abraham we know God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Isaac we know God as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything Isaac gained was gained through receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Abraham we see God's goal and standard.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Isaac we see God's power and life and that He is the Provider.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything that Isaac had was obtained and not attained.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Christian life originates from God; it is spontaneous and not artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was only one question in Isaac's life: "Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The answer is: "Jehovah-Jireh" the Lord will provide.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Jacob we see something altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was a naughty, conniving, scheming, supplanting, and selfish person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The God of Jacob was not the God of provision but the God of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Isaac found favor in the sight of the Lord, but Jacob was disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Isaac represents the supply of the resurrection life of Christ, while Jacob represents the crushing of the natural life through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The hollow of his thigh was touched, and he became crippled; he could no longer be naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people only see Christ's life and forget their own natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result their natural life creeps in. Some people only see the natural life, and forget the riches in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need the experience of Isaac as well as the experience of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that Abraham represents God the Father, Isaac represents God the Son, and Jacob represents God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In God's work there is the need of the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
