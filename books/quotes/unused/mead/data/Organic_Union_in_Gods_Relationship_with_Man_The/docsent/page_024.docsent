   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 4:15 Paul said, "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in small matters such as getting our hair cut, combing our hair, and choosing a necktie, we need to do them in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Certain sisters may take twenty minutes to comb their hair yet not spend two minutes to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to grow up into Christ in all the small matters in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not need to conduct ourselves in a certain way because we are forced to do so by outward regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to grow to the extent that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we grow into Christ, when we comb our hair, we will comb it in Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In combing our hair we may say, "Lord Jesus, I am with You; be with me in my combing my hair."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 4:15 says that we need to grow until we reach the level of being in Christ in all things in shopping, in buying a pair of shoes, in spending our money, and even in choosing a pair of eyeglasses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a great thing to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GROWING UNTO THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST BY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PERFECTED BY THE GIFTED PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to Ephesians 4:11-13, we also need to grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ by being perfected by the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every person has the stature of a human being, but verse 13 speaks of "the stature of the fullness of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The stature of the fullness of Christ is the stature of the church Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church as the Body of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to grow to match that measure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is "tall," yet we are still so "short."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, our measure does not match the stature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is the case, how could the church be built up?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In a family, if the children do not grow but remain small, the family cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today it is difficult to realize the building up of the church, because most Christians have not grown but have remained infants 1 Cor 3:1-2; Heb 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among Christians we can see many opinions, criticisms, reasonings, and outbursts of temper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, who is mature?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Very few have grown unto the measure of the stature of the proper church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>GROWING WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians 2:19 says that we are growing with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse indicates that our God who is living in us is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Himself He does not need to grow, for in Himself He is perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet in us He needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has been within many of us for years, but we may not allow Him to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have seen some children who were so small at their birth that they had to be put into an incubator.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, from the time of their birth they lived in a situation and environment which fit in with their growth in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, they grew to be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, we need to give God a situation and environment that are fitting for Him to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The growth of a plant depends on the environment in which it is placed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A plant in the shade may grow and yet bear no blossoms, whereas the same kind of plant placed in the sunshine may grow and produce many blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to grow properly, plants also need to be in an environment where there is water and fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do we give our God the adequate environment for Him to grow in us?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Shopping is a great temptation to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many of the sisters like to read the newspaper on Saturday to see what is on sale.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they are considering whether or not to go shopping, something within them restricts them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At such a time they need to say, "Lord, thank You for Your restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I give You the opportunity to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I drop my shopping."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they would do this, Christ would grow in them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, most of the time the sisters would not care for the Lord's inner restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, they would still go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That restricts the Lord from growing in them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In many things we have an inner restriction, but we do not listen to that restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead, we go our way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Going our own way is a restriction to the Lord's growth in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Spending money loosely without any care for the Lord restricts God's growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In everything we have to consider Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to give Him the convenience and let Him have the liberty, the free way, to go on in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do this, He will grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He will become a "strong young man" in us 1 John 2:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We grow with the growth of God, and the growth of God simply means the increase of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is in us, but He is short of His increase in us because we do not provide adequate room, adequate space, for Him to grow.</S>
