   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The People Who Walked</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Darkness Having Seen a Great Light</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah 9:2 says, "The people who walked in the darkness / Have seen a great light;/Upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death/Light has shined."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This prophecy was fulfilled in Matthew 4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ came to Galilee, the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, light sprang up v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 9:2 is continuing even today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus is still visiting the "Galileans"; He is still visiting "Galilee," the despised region, to gain the despised people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, to be in Galilee is to be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If those who occupy high positions in society would be saved, they must become those who are in the despised region of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>C. The Lord Multiplying the Nation</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaiah 9:3 goes on to say, "You have multiplied the nation; / You have increased their gladness;/They are glad before You as with the gladness of harvest,/As men rejoice when they divide spoil."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This prophecy refers to Peter, John, James, and all the early apostles, and it also concerns us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are the farmers in the harvest and the fighters gaining the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This refers to the increase, spread, and growth of Christ on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>D. The Lord Breaking the Yoke of Their Burden</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 4 continues, "For You break the yoke of their burden /And the staff on their shoulder,/The rod of their oppressor,/As in the day of Midian."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that Christ as the great light is breaking the yoke that has been upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>E. All the Boots of Those Who</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>in Boots Trample in the Battle Quaking</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, verse 5 says, "For all the boots/Of those who in boots trample in the battle quake/And the garments/Rolled in blood/Are for burning;/They are fuel for fire."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that a battle is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today Christ is fighting, and we, His followers, are also fighting.</S>
