THE LORD IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>As long as we are being renewed and sanctified by the Spirit, we are also being transformed by the Spirit as the Lord in resurrection (2 Cor. 3:17-18). Whatever we are according to our first birth is natural. But the part of our being that is transformed is in resurrection. The goal of transformation is to transfer us out of our natural life into the resurrection life. The transfer from the natural life into the resurrection life is transformation. We were born natural, so we need to be regenerated, which means that we need to be generated again. Regeneration may be considered as the beginning of transformation. The renewing and sanctifying of the Spirit are the continuation of the transformation by regeneration. Transformation itself is the consummation of the transfer from the natural life to the resurrection life. This transformation takes place by the Spirit as the Lord. In 2 Corinthians 3:17 the Lord is called the Spirit, and in verse 18 there is a compound holy title&mdash;&ldquo;the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Spirit is the transforming Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEARCHED BY AND TRANSFUSED WITH<br />
THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We are also being searched by and transfused with the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 4:5; 5:6). In this dark age today, the Spirit has become a sevenfold intensified Spirit. The seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb and the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. Eyes are for searching and transfusing. When we look at others, we search them out. We can tell what their attitude is, what kind of persons they are, and how they feel. Our looking at others is also a kind of transfusing of our inward being into them. The seven Spirits being the seven eyes of the Lamb means that God is searching us and transfusing us with all that He is. This is another organic process in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTICIPATING IN THE FELLOWSHIP<br />
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
IN THE FLOW OF THE GRACE OF CHRIST<br />
OUT FROM THE LOVE OF GOD</h2>
<p>As the members of the Body of Christ, we are participating in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in the flow of the grace of Christ out from the love of God. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; &ldquo;With you all&rdquo; indicates our participation. The love of God is the source, the fountain that flows out. The grace of Christ is the course of the love of God. Then the grace of Christ with the love of God reaches us in the fellowship, the communication, of the Spirit for our inward enjoyment and participation. Day after day and all day we should participate in the fellowship, the communication, of the Spirit which is in the flow of the grace of Christ that comes out of the source of the love of God. This participation is our daily enjoyment, and it is an organic process in the Spirit that will change us, renew us, transform us, and perfect us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This refers to the believers&rsquo; organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life, but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
