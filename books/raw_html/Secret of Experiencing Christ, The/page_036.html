<P>Consider our physical being. We have skin, flesh, and bones; we have many physical parts which are touchable and visible. Yet, this is merely the outermost part of our being. Inside of our body there is a life which is invisible and untouchable. However, although this life is intangible, it is the most crucial part of our human being. Without this crucial part we would be like a lifeless machine or a robot. Today's objective teaching is too superficial; it has made many Christians like robots or machines in their spiritual life. Many do not know how to fellowship with the Lord or how to experience and enjoy the Lord in the fellowship of the Spirit, and they do not know that the Lord today is one with them in their spirit. They fail to see the two aspects of the Lord's being.</P><P>Christ is the King of all, the Lord of all, and even the Head of all in the heavens. He is sitting there on the throne exercising His authority to rule the entire universe. However, this is just one side. On the other side, through His death and resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Today Christ is the Lord, the King, and the Head objectively, far away from us. As such a One He is great, marvelous, high, and dignified. But in this aspect we cannot experience Him. He is there in the heavens, yet we cannot touch Him. But, hallelujah, He has another aspect. He became a life-giving Spirit. The word for spirit in both Hebrew and Greek also means air. Today, Christ is just like the air. Hallelujah, He is the life-giving air!</P><P>We all know that physical air gives us life. If there were no air, after a few minutes all of us would be dead. We live by breathing; we live by the air. Today the Lord Jesus is our air. John 20:20 tells us that on the day of the Lord's resurrection He came back to the disciples. They were not expecting Him. As they met together, they were fully disappointed, thinking that the Lord Jesus had left them. To their great surprise, all of a sudden the Lord Jesus was there. Then the Lord breathed on them and told them to receive the holy air, the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). He breathed on them to bring in more air.</P><P> In Greek the word for air, for Spirit, and for breath is pneuma. When I was a young man living in north China, not many of the young people there knew English. An agent of Chevrolet began to sell automobiles in China, and since they needed some young people who knew English, they asked me to be their agent. As I looked at one of the cars, I saw the word PNEUMATIC printed on the tires in large English letters. Although I knew English, when I read this word, I said, "What is this? Pneumatic?" Later I learned that it meant to be full of air. A tire needs to be full of air; otherwise, it becomes flat. No one desires to have a flat tire. However, spiritually speaking, when we are short of the Spirit, we are like a flat tire. We are not pneumatic because we lack the spiritual air. Many Christians do not see that Jesus Christ today is the life-giving pneuma. He is very pneumatic, and when we are filled with Him, we also become pneumatic, full of air. When the tires of your car are short of pneuma, you go to the gas station to get more air. Then the tires are full of air. In a spiritual sense, we need to check ourselves, whether we are pneumatic or a flat tire. I can testify that I am pneumatic; I am full of air. We should not be Christians who are short of air; we should be pneumatic Christians. Not only every day, but every second, we must breathe in Christ.</P>
