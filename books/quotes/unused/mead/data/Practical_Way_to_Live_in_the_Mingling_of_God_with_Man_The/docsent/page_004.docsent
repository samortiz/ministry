   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEVENTH STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALL THINGS WORKING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR OUR CONFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seventh stage of the Christian life as shown to us in Romans is the Lord s arranging all things to work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This good can be considered to be our profit, which is our conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 8:28-29 says, And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By using all things all environments, circumstances, and persons as instruments, the Lord brings us into a situation of suffering in which we can be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Romans 8:9 we are told that we have the Spirit of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The all things, however, are mainly outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can use the example of cooking to illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we cook, we often use a pot.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within the pot, we put water; outside of the pot, there is fire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we have the water within the pot and the fire outside of the pot, the food can be cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times we sense the Lord s presence within us as the Spirit and feel sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, we frequently find ourselves in environments and circumstances that are akin to a burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These environments are arranged by God in His sovereignty to work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The good spoken of here is our being conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord arranges a wife for a husband or children for parents, the wife and the children work together for the husband s and parents conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Throughout my forty years of Christian life, I have noticed that many times a brother whom it seems no one can help marries a precious wife who seems tailor-made to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Lord s sovereign arrangement, a peculiar wife always will be able to deal with a peculiar husband and to work together for good for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything is sovereign and everything is in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He makes all things work together for our profit so that we will be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in the seventh stage we see a person who is not only spiritual but who also bears the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In those who are in this stage, we will be able to recognize the image, glory, expression, and manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE EIGHTH STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LIVING IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The last picture of the Christian life in the book of Romans is contained in chapter 12.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This picture shows us one who is saved, walks according to the Spirit, is being conformed to the image of Christ, and is a member of the Body of Christ living in the Body of Christ and practicing the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a one realizes that he is not an individual but a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this stage we can see the daily Christian living, which is a living that is in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever we as Christians do, we must do as members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this stage we realize that we are no longer independent and individual persons but are instead members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the time we have this realization onward, we can never be independent or individualistic, because we are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is impossible for a member of my physical body to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a member of my physical body is independent, it is separate from the body and dies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only so, it becomes something that is dreadful and awful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The human hand is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose, however, that my hand were separated from my body and put on a table.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely this would be an awful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today many believers are like separated members of a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are not only dead; they are dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is because they are separated from the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we live as members in the Body of Christ, the more dear and beloved we are to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, in the last stage of the Christian life as seen in the book of Romans, we see the Body of Christ composed of all the saved ones who live in the Body mutually as members.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the maturity of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this chapter we have covered the eight stages of the Christian life as seen in the Epistle to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the first stage we see a sinful person who is under the condemnation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The second stage presents to us a saved person one who has been justified through the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the third stage we see a person who, as a saved one, realizes that originally he was born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the fourth stage, we see how such a person realizes the fact that he is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The fifth stage presents to us a person who is deceived and tempted to try to do good by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the sixth stage this person comes to know and realize that there is nothing left for him to do but to walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the seventh stage this person accepts all the environments and circumstances from the sovereign hand of God for him to be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the eighth and final stage he realizes that he is a member of the Body of Christ and as such will never be independent or individualistic but will live, walk, act, and work as a member in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are no longer sinners in the world; we are members in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As such, we must experience and enjoy Christ and walk, live, act, and work in the Body of Christ as His many members.</S>
