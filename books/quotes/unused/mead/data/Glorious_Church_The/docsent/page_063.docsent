   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The New Jerusalem is the woman whom we have been considering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Genesis we saw a garden and a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This woman sinned, and God drove her out of the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now in the new heaven and new earth, the woman and the holy city are one; they are no longer two separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the New Jerusalem is the woman, the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb; therefore, the woman and the holy city are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only so, but God's throne is established in the New Jerusalem, or we may say that God Himself dwells within this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Almighty One is dwelling in her.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, it does not matter how great the force or temptation that can come from without.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Evil powers can no longer enter, nor can man fall again, because God dwells within her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The blessing of the new heaven and new earth is the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All who have tasted something of God's presence in their experience know that it is indeed a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No other blessing is greater or more precious than this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us read again the last part of verse 3: "He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do we see the relationship between God and man?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does it really mean for us to be the people of God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It means that God will dwell with us, and therefore, we will be made His people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What does it mean that God will be our God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It means that God will be with us, and therefore, He will be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are away from His presence, God cannot be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The greatest and highest blessing in eternity is that God will be with us and be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 4 says, "And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All men have experienced the shedding of tears, but in the new heaven and new earth they will receive this blessing God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death is wholly a consequence of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in the new heaven and new earth, there will no longer be any death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last enemy will be abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sorrow or mourning is the aching of our heart, the feeling of inward suffering; crying is the weeping without, the outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pain is the suffering of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But God will put an end to all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are all summed up in the words: every tear, death, sorrow, crying, and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But they will be no more; they will all pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 5 says, "And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The difficulty that we face today is that even though we are the new creation, we still live in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in that day all things will become new; all things will be in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only will the inward being be new, but the outward will be as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The entire environment and all things within it will be made new.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is called eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The new creation is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our hearts will be satisfied only when all things are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah 6 speaks of a painful experience which we all share: "I am a man of unclean lips."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition, another painful experience is recorded: "And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in that day, everything around us will be in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That day will be absolutely glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation 21:5 continues, "And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How good it is to have this written down.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God gave these words to John and asked him to write them down.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not one iota or one serif of what is written can pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These words are faithful and true!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our ultimate faith will be to see God win the final victory.</S>
