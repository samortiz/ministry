[3]  JOHN CHAPTER 1 I. The Eternal Word Incarnated Coming to Bring God into Man 1:1 13:38 A. Introduction to Life and Building 1:1-51 1.
[4]  CHAPTER 2 B. Life's Principle and Life's Purpose 2:1-22 1.
[5]  1 But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[6]  2 This one came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.
[7]  3 Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[8]  1 When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2 Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but rather His disciples , 3 He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.
[9]  10 Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.
[10]  The Need of the Impotent Life's Enlivening 5:1-47
[11]  37 And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form, 38 And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe.
[12]  The Need of the Hungry Life's Feeding 6:1-71
[13]  1 And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
[14]  1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
[15]  2 And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.
[16]  16 But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me. 17 And in your law also it has been written that the testimony of two men is true: 18 I am One who testifies concerning Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies concerning Me. 19 They said then to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered.
[17]  45 But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me. 46 Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me? 47 He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.
[18]  The Need of the Blind in Religion Life's Sight and Life's Shepherding 9:1 10:42
[19]  1 Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber; 2 But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
[20]  The Need of the Dead Life's Resurrecting 11:1-57
[21]  And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. 42 And I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing around, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me. 43 And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out! 44 And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with cloths, and his face was bound about with a handkerchief.
[22]  CHAPTER 12 D. Life's Issue and Multiplication 12:1-50 1.
[23]  Life's Issue A House of Feasting a Miniature of the Church Life vv.
[24]  8 For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have Me. 9 Then a great crowd of the Jews found out that He was there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.
[25]  44 But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes into Me does not believe into Me, but into Him who sent Me; 45 And he who beholds Me beholds Him who sent Me. 46 I have come as a light into the world, that every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness.
[26]  CHAPTER 13 E. Life's Washing in Love to Maintain Fellowship 13:1-38
[27]  1 Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come for Him to depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost.
[28]  2 And while supper was taking place, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him, 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God, 4 Rose from supper and laid aside His outer garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself; 5 Then He poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded, 6 He came then to Simon Peter.
[29]  7 Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not know now, but you will know after these things.
[30]  Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me. 9 Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
[31]  Jesus Crucified and Christ Resurrected Going to Prepare the Way to Bring Man into God, and as the Spirit Coming to Abide and Live in the Believers for the Building of God's Habitation 14:1 21:25 A. Life's Indwelling For the Building of God's Habitation 14:1 16:33 1.
[32]  1 Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me. 2 In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
[33]  3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.
[34]  7 If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.
[35]  16 And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, 17 Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[36]  The Organism of the Triune God in the Divine Dispensing 15:1 16:4
[37]  2 They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.
[38]  3 And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me. 4 But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you of them.
[39]  7 But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
[40]  16 A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me. 17 Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father? 18 Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about.
[41]  19 Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him and He said to them, Are you inquiring among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me?
[42]  26 In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you, 27 For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.
[43]  The Son to Be Glorified That the Father May Be Glorified vv.
[44]  1 These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You; 2 Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.
[45]  3 And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.
[46]  7 Now they have come to know that all that You have given Me is from You, 8 For the words which You gave Me I have given to them, and they received them and knew truly that I came forth from You, and they have believed that You sent Me. 9 I ask concerning them; I do not ask concerning the world, but concerning those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours; 10 And all that is Mine is Yours, and Yours Mine; and I have been glorified in them.
[47]  22 And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; 23 I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. 24 Father, concerning that which You have given Me, I desire that they also may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory, which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
[48]  CHAPTER 18 C. Life's Process through Death and Resurrection for Multiplication 18:1 20:13, 17 1.
[49]  Delivering Himself in Voluntary Boldness to Be Processed 18:1-11
[50]  1 When Jesus had said these things, He went forth with His disciples across the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, into which He entered as well as His disciples.
[51]  1 Therefore at that time Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.
[52]  4 And Pilate went outside again and said to them, Behold, I am bringing Him out to you that you may know that I find no fault in Him.
[53]  2 She ran therefore and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.
[54]  And when He had said this, He said to him, Follow Me. 20 Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined on His breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You? 21 Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man? 22 Jesus said to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me. 23 This word therefore went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die, yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?
[55]  Perhaps you have wondered what kind of life God wants you to live.
[56]  You may already know that the Bible is a wonderful book, but perhaps you do not know what it says about the kind of life a Christian ought to live.
[57]  All the conditions of these nine cases can also be found in each individual person.
[58]  All aspects of the Lord's work as shown and signified in these nine cases are the different aspects of the Lord's full salvation, which are 1 regeneration, 2 the satisfaction with the living water, 3 the healing power of life, 4 the enlivening with the power of life, 5 the feeding with the bread of life, 6 the quenching of thirst with the rivers of living water, 7 the deliverance from sin, 8 the opening of the blind eyes, and 9 resurrection.
[59]  A. Man's and Religion's False Concept the Need of Better Teaching to Improve Man
[60]  Due to human culture and the Jewish religion, Nicodemus thought that man needed to behave.
[61]  What is the way for us to be regenerated?
[62]  In verses 15, 16, 18, and 36, the Lord said, "That everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life"; "that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life"; "he who believes in Him is not judged"; "he who believes in the Son has eternal life."
[63]  The Way to Experience God in the Gospel of John THE WORD, THE FLESH, AND THE BREATH
[64]  In the Gospel of John, there are three wonderful words.
[65]  If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, who is as available as breath or air, how could He be in us?
[66]  If we consider these various items covered in John, we realize how vital they are for our existence.
