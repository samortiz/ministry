There was this round loaf of barley bread tumbling through the camp of Midian. And it came to the tent and struck it, so that it fell and turned upside down. And the tent collapsed&rdquo; (v. 13). His companion responded by saying that this was nothing else than the sword of Gideon and that God had delivered Midian and all the camp into Gideon&rsquo;s hand. When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped, returned to the camp of Israel, and said, &ldquo;Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand&rdquo; (v. 15).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
