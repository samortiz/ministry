   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. ITS WALL A. Built with Jasper</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 18 says, And the building material of its wall was jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jasper is a transformed precious stone 1 Cor 3:12 that bears the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This stone is crystal clear and dark green.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 4:3 says, He who was sitting was like in appearance to a jasper stone and a sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to this verse, the appearance of God on the throne is like jasper and sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The dark green color of jasper signifies life in its richness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Green grass, green fields, and green mountains all testify of the richness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a lawn or field is brown, we have the impression that there is no life there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But dark green signifies the richness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God as the One on the throne in chapter four also has the appearance of a sardius, a most precious stone in the color of red, which signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While jasper indicates God as the God of glory in His rich life, sardius signifies God as the God of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our God today is the God of life and the God of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when we enter into the New Jerusalem, we shall have no further need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the color of the wall of the city will be jasper, dark green, expressing life in its richness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. A Hundred and Forty-four Cubits High</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have seen that the wall is a hundred and forty-four cubits high, and that this measure is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have pointed out that this signifies that the wall of the city is not natural, but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything we say, everything we do, and everything we are in the church life today must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The principle of resurrection is that the natural life is killed and that the divine life rises up in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A number of times, as I was about to lose my temper, I exercised my spirit to crucify my natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever I did this, I was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must not only practice this with our temper, but even with our love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not love others in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Love them in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Natural love is like honey.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of a honey love, we need a love that is in resurrection, a love that has been killed by the cross and resurrected with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no honey in such a love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In place of honey, there are frankincense and salt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Leviticus 2, the meal offering could have frankincense and salt, but not honey.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The love among most Christians today is rarely the love in resurrection, which is the real love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Mostly, it is not only like honey, but also full of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although many Christians talk about love, this love may not be a love that has been dealt with by the cross and resurrected with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we need is a resurrected love, a love which is in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I like to see the brothers and sisters growing in life and experiencing the building, but I do not like to see any natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is better to keep a distance between yourself and others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not wear their clothes; do not even use their Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If your natural life has been dealt with, you will not want to use a Bible that belongs to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Using another s Bible does not indicate that you love him in the spirit; rather, it proves that you love him according to your natural taste.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You spend so much time with that particular brother because he matches your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may think that you are growing in life as you fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, because your love for him is natural, you are not growing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we love others, the greater should be the distance between ourselves and them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church life, we must learn to do everything in resurrection, not in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are not certain whether a thing you are about to do is in resurrection, please do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Pray and wait until you have the assurance that you are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fact that the wall of the city of New Jerusalem is measured with the measurement of a man, that is, of an angel, means not only that it is measured according to the divine nature, but also that it is according to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must love me and I must love you, not in our natural life, but in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Never yield an inch of ground to the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No matter how much you love others, keep a distance between yourself and them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do this, you will be kept from the natural life, and you will love others in resurrection, according to humanity, but in angelic likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1932, the year I came into the church life, I had my first lesson in learning how to do things in resurrection, not in my natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There was a certain sister who always helped others, but who did not have enough money to buy a good Bible for herself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She spent her money on the needy ones, not on herself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I came to know her situation and noticed that she had to use a very old Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Spontaneously I was burdened to buy her a good, leather-bound Bible and to give it to her anonymously.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As I went to the Lord about this, I said, Lord, I am about to buy a Bible for this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Am I doing this in my natural life or in Your resurrection life?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By inquiring of the Lord in this way, I learned a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because I was not certain that I was acting according to resurrection life, I was not able to buy the Bible immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I waited for a period of time until I was sure that I was not acting according to my natural life, but according to Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One day I purchased a Bible for her and gave it to her anonymously.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through receiving this gift of a Bible, her faith was confirmed, and she grew in the matter of believing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I had given her a Bible a few weeks earlier, she would have not been helped in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The very day I had the assurance that I could give her a Bible in resurrection was the exact day she needed to receive it.</S>
