   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>14 Man as the Center Was Generated</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man as the center was generated, the higher life with the highest consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the maturity of life that has the image of God and is able to exercise dominion for God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On this earth, man is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have pointed out before, the heavens are for the earth and the earth is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything in the sky the sunshine, the rain, and the air are for the growth of life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without sunshine, rain, and air there is no possibility to have life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So, the heavens are for this earth, and this earth, with all kinds of life, is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all know that the minerals are for the plants, the plants are for the animals, both the plants and the animals are for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So man is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The heavens were fixed and the earth was prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything was ready for man to come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God didn't create man and then ask man to wait until He fixed the heavens and prepared the earth for him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, after God fixed the heavens, prepared the earth, and made everything ready, man came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the last, God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man ranks as the last, but he was and still is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is exactly like a marriage according to oriental custom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a marriage, the husband prepares everything and, at the last, the bride comes in. The bride does not appear and then wait for everything to be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After everything has been prepared, the bride appears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, the whole earth is a place for God's wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has prepared all things for His wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who is the bride?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The bride is man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man is the maturity of all created life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without man, there is no maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Look at the grass.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is green and tender, but it is lacking in form, in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has no face.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The herbs, including corn and wheat, are more developed in form.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, they also have no face.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The trees are larger, bearing fruit as well as seeds; yet, none of them has a face with which to express itself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After these three levels of plant life, we have the fish, the first level of animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fish does have a face with two small eyes, but its head is not clearly distinguished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And a fish has no neck.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The birds, however, have a distinct face and neck.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have eyes, ears, and a small mouth, somewhat closer to the face of man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The cattle, horses, and oxen have faces similar to a human face.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Following the cattle, we have the beasts, especially the lion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The face of a lion closely resembles a human face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Darwin foolishly said that man is a descendent of the monkey, it is nevertheless true that the faces of some beasts resemble the face of man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, regardless of how much the faces of birds, cattle, beasts, eagles, oxen, and lambs resemble the face of man, they are not man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are short and they are inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are not the maturity of the created life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ezekiel 1:5, 10 speaks of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These four living creatures look like man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Each has four faces: the face of a man at the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle at the rear.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The eagle is at the rear because an eagle's face is not much like a man's. The faces of the lion and the ox are much closer to man's face.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, man's face is supreme.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, the human life is the maturity of all created life, having the ability to express God and to exercise God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The most striking and wonderful thing about the human life is its consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do have the highest consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This consciousness of ours is higher than the fish, the eagle, the ox, and the lion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As far as consciousness goes, the human life is the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to shout, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this universe and on this earth man has been generated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man has been created, possessing a life with the highest consciousness, a life that is able to express God and represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The creation of man was so crucial and important that the Triune God held a conference before He did it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The sky had been restored.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The heavens had been fixed for the purpose of serving the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The dry land appeared for the purpose of generating plant life, the animal life, and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Look at the sky: we have the sun, the moon, the stars, the rain, and the air.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Look at the earth: we have the grass, the herbs, and the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have the birds in the air, the fish in the water, and the cattle, the beasts, and the creeping things on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As the center of all this, we have man, expressing God and representing God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After God created man, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was satisfied.</S>
