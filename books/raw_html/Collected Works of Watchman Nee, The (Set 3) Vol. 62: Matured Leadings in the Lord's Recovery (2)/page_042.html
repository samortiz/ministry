<h2 class="head1">ONENESS AND COORDINATION<br />BEING THE ISSUE OF THE LIFE WITHIN</h2><p>Witness Lee: A few days ago we fellowshipped about answering the demand of Christ within us. This is the genuine service of the church. Our service in coordination is not something artificial. Many people talk about the teaching of oneness. When I hear it, my spirit feels uncomfortable. Many people are not clear about oneness. The principle of oneness is actually the same as the principle of coordination. First, we have to understand that the oneness of the church is not something manmade. If I am not one with a few brothers, I cannot be exhorted to be one with doctrines. If oneness can be achieved by exhortation, this oneness is false and artificial. We may pass on some doctrines to the brothers, telling them that we are all for the Lord, for the saints, and for the church, and as such we should drop our opinions. The brothers may say, "Okay, this word has convinced us. We give up. We are willing to be one." This is still human oneness; it is not the oneness that issues from life. But if we sense a spontaneous demand within us, and we willingly allow the life within us to flow out, we will have the genuine oneness. The genuine oneness of the church is the coming forth of Christ within each one of us. When this outflow of Christ is added together, we have the oneness. If none of us answers the demand of the Holy Spirit within us, we do not have the oneness. Only as Christ comes forth from all the saints is there the genuine oneness.</p><p>The coordination in the church is not a kind of piling together but the result of us handing ourselves over willingly to the Lord and serving and working together under the sovereign arrangement of the Holy Spirit. If we call three or five brothers and sisters together and assign them some service, this is merely a kind of organization; it is not genuine coordination. Coordination is having the grace to bring out the Christ in Brother Chang and the Christ in Brother Lee and then serving together. If we harbor a sin, if we have some worldly cravings or carnal objects that we have not given up, or if we still jealously guard our self, ideas, inclinations, and concepts from His dealing even though they were touched by the Spirit, we may say that we are one with the brothers and sisters, but in reality we cannot be joined to another lover of the Lord. This is because this lover of the Lord has forsaken the world, rejected sin, and dealt with the self, but we have not. We must realize that outward oneness is manmade and false.</p><p>Let me repeat: The coordination of the Body is not organizational; it is something that issues from the life within. For the past few days I have had a heavy burden within me, hoping that Brother Nee would say a word concerning coordination. However, Brother Nee has asked me to speak. I can only obey. I feel that there is one thing which I have not yet been able to release. This cannot be covered in one or two words.</p><p>What the Lord has done through Brother Nee in Hong Kong is a great thing, an unprecedented thing. This is something that the Lord has done; it is not something that man's exhortation can achieve. Some have handed over their possessions. Others have forsaken the world and handed over their future, their career, their body, and their time. For this I truly worship the Lord. I am afraid, however, that some will think that this handing over is a procedure to get into the coordination. Actually, by handing ourselves over, we open a way for Christ to flow out of us. Coordination is when the spirit within all of us is released. Coordination is an event in our spirit; it liberates the life that lies within our spirit. I would ask the saints in Hong Kong, as well as the responsible brothers, to give me the liberty to say a word. I feel that you have paid too much attention to the practical affairs and have neglected the spirit. I dare not say that you have ignored it, but at least you have neglected it. All of you have handed yourselves over. But your spirits have not been handed over yet. Hence, you are still not in the coordination. The church is the Christ within every Christian being added together. Church service is the Christ within everyone being released. When the life of Christ comes forth from the brothers and sisters, we have coordination.</p><p>When we were in Foochow, twenty to thirty workers handed over not only their material possessions, but their work as well. Once they handed themselves over in this way, they were able to coordinate together. As long as we hold on to anything, whatever it may be, we cannot coordinate, and there is no oneness or one accord. Oneness, one accord, and coordination are nothing but the coming forth of the Christ within us. If the life of Christ in the believers in Hong Kong cannot come forth, nothing will happen even if the gospel teams parade through the street with bullhorns and even if we make all kinds of arrangements for visitation and service. I hope that the saints here in Hong Kong can be taught by God in this particular point.</p><p>The church in Taipei registered itself as "Christian Assembly Hall" with the government because of political expediency. Later some people came from Shanghai and used the same name. They even imitated our gospel teams, and they practiced head covering as well. They can be exactly the same as we are in everything, but the release of the Holy Spirit is not something that one can contend for. Our service to the Lord depends on whether or not the Spirit has a free way through us. All outward imitation and mimicking are artificial; they are not the genuine service of the church. The church's service in coordination depends entirely on the release of the Holy Spirit from within us; it has nothing to do with how closely we can imitate one another. The problems of the churches and the co-workers cannot be solved any other way. They can only be solved in the Body, in the Holy Spirit, and in life. When Christ within us is released, life flows and problems go away.</p><p>If all the brothers and sisters can be one and if they remain in harmony and in coordination, there will be power in the church service. If a man works much, yet does not sense the Holy Spirit's operation within him, this is like eating food that contains no vitamins at all. We may hold tightly on to anything in our hands or in our hearts. It may not be money. It may be the work, our view, or our feeling. As long as there is something that we will not let go of, some area where we refuse to be dealt with in, it is impossible to have power or to coordinate with others. Coordination is not outward activity. This standard is too low. Coordination is absolutely not for taking care of outward works. It is for spiritual building up. It is something that issues from the life within. In order to serve in coordination, the life within us has to come out.</p>
