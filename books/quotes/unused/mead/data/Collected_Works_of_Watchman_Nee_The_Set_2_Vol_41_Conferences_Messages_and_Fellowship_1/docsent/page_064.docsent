   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING BESIDE OURSELVES IN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible also tells us about many people who were beside themselves in offering up their possessions and houses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 4 mentions the disciples selling their all and laying the money they received at the apostles' feet v. 34 . Many people agree that we should be zealous, but they say that we should be careful, balanced, and not go to extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet throughout the past two thousand years, all those who have truly consecrated themselves to the Lord were men who risked everything to offer up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more a person loves the Lord, the more he consecrates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One brother asked me, "How can you love the Lord so much, and why can't I love Him as much?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I said, "If you give your money to the Lord, you will love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord said that where your treasure is, there is your heart also."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you want your heart to follow the Lord, your money must first go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When your money goes into the offering box, and you say, "Amen," your heart will go with it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Shanghai two sisters who were nurses each earned less than a hundred dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They saved their wages in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After they heard the Lord's word, they were moved in their heart, and one after the other offered up all their savings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today many people are planning too much for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are not willing to offer up their all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They make reservations for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The result is that the gospel has lost its impact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During every great revival in history, we find men who were beside themselves in loving the Lord, who risked all to offer up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am not exhorting you to give everything to the Lord, but you must be a person who is fully consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One elderly sister once came to Mr. George M ller and said, "My seventieth birthday is approaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By that time I will have saved enough money to buy a coat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This has been my wish for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been saving since I was forty-two years old, and I have been looking forward to the day when I would have such a coat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have waited twenty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today I can finally buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, the Lord is touching me to offer up these fifteen pounds."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Mr. M ller heard this, he felt that this would cost the elderly sister too much, and he wondered whether she would later regret it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He dared not accept that money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet the sister was quite resolute and determined to offer it up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, Mr. M ller testified that he had thought that it was difficult for poor people to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord had died for all, and when one was touched by the Lord, even a savings of twenty-eight years meant nothing to her anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A few years ago I was working in Southeast Asia for a period of four months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the end of my visit, we had a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the meeting, two children came to me while we were drinking tea.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One was eight years old, and the other was twelve years old.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They told me that they wanted to offer something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One handed me six dollars, and the other handed me eight dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was the amount they had earned for their work during summer vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They intended to use that money to buy themselves a pair of shoes, but on that day they decided to offer it up for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I did not know if they were clear about what they were doing, and I asked their uncle if they were really offering this money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He told me that they were serious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was hard for me to take that money.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That money was the hard-earned money of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They had paid a great price to earn it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since they were going to offer it to the Lord, I could not return it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I had to accept it, but I said to the Lord, "This is money from the children's sweat and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I do not use it in the right way, I will be sinning before You."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we want all the young people to offer their time to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, we want them to offer themselves fully to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may have to give themselves to make money for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such ones have to do their best to earn and offer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course, we must earn our money through righteous means.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may have to offer themselves to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need both kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Does not the gospel need to be preached in many places?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is not the church taking the right path?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there were no need to preach the gospel, and if the church were on the wrong path, we could keep our money and save it for our own use.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if the gospel needs to be preached, and if the church is on the right path, we have to be beside ourselves for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to recalibrate the focus of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Formerly, we earned money for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today everything has to be for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God's work in China should not be limited to the coastal regions or only to the Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are vast regions in the interior of China which have never heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to rise up and be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to be beside ourselves in the preaching of the gospel and in offering up our all.</S>
