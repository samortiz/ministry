<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED TO SEE THE VISION<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord Jesus, how we treasure this time! We believe it is altogether of You that we are all gathered together into Yourself. Lord, grant Your blessing upon all of us and do bless this time. Sanctify us, Lord. Lord, grant us the anointing. Lord, grant us a gracious, rich, and abundant visit. Lord, open up the heavens. Even Lord, open up Your heart to us and help us to open ourselves to you. Amen, Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAVENLY VISION</h2>
<p>In Acts 26:19 Paul said, &ldquo;Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&rdquo; After Paul was caught by the Lord, he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. Paul speaks not only of a vision, but of a vision from the heavens, a heavenly vision. In his defense of himself and his ministry before King Agrippa, he indicated that he had earlier received a vision from the earth, an earthly vision. This was the vision of the law. Paul had been fully caught by that vision, but while he was so vigorously carrying out that vision, he was caught by One from the heavens who gave him another vision. This other vision is mainly described in verse 18: &ldquo;To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rdquo; Forgiveness of sins is the initial grace and the base of all the blessings of the New Testament jubilee, while the inheritance is the main object of this heavenly vision. For us to see what this inheritance is requires much unveiling. Actually, Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles are the development and the description of this inheritance. If you would read and study his fourteen Epistles thoroughly, you could see that this inheritance is nothing less than the processed Triune God who is consummated in the all-inclusive, compound Spirit. This inheritance is the very Triune God in His divinity dispensed into us for our enjoyment. The forgiveness of sins is an initiation into the enjoyment of such an inheritance. This heavenly vision is not like the earthly vision concerning the law. The law does not give life (Gal. 3:21) or bring any kind of enjoyment. There is no inheritance with the law. The law is full of requirements, and the law only demands.</p>
<p>The initial stage of the vision from the heavens is the forgiveness of sins. Do not despise this initial aspect. The forgiveness of sins deals with so many things, including sin, oldness, worldliness, and everything that is a frustration to God&rsquo;s eternal move. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, vigorously carrying out the old vision, he became a great obstacle to frustrate God&rsquo;s eternal economy, yet he had no realization of this. To sin is not just to steal, to commit fornication, or to murder. Apparently, Saul was a very ethical and moral person, never stealing, never committing fornication, and never murdering. According to the law he was righteous, but in the eyes of God he was the second greatest enemy to God&rsquo;s economy. The greatest enemy was Satan, and the second greatest enemy was Saul of Tarsus. The embodiment of God, the very Christ, came to this enemy telling him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? You are attacking Me. You are My enemy. No one among human kind has ever frustrated Me as much as you have. Do you think all the Gentiles are so sinful and that you are so righteous? Actually, you are more sinful than all the Gentiles. But here is a vision for you to bring mainly to My chosen people among the Gentiles, those whom you condemn to the uttermost. The first item of this vision is the forgiveness of sins, and the positive aspect of this vision is that you are to bring the Gentiles condemned by you into the very enjoyment of Me, the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Of course, you also are My chosen one. I forgive you and now I bring you into this enjoyment. Whatever you have seen of Me and whatever you have enjoyed of Me will be the very vision that you will carry to the Gentiles condemned by you. I will make them your fellow-believers, and I will make them and you with all your fellow countrymen chosen by Me one Body, not only to enjoy Me, but also to contain Me to let Me have a full expression in this universe, the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acts 26:18 says that the inheritance is among &ldquo;those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rdquo; The phrase, &ldquo;by faith in Me&rdquo; means for the believers to enter into an organic union with the embodied God in Christ and processed and consummated in the Spirit. We all have to enter into this organic union with such a processed and consummated God. How could the chosen ones enter into such a union? By faith, not by sight or appearance. This vision is comprised solely of invisible things which are only realized and substantiated by faith.</p>
<p>We should not regard Acts 26:18 in a common way. However, for years we may not have spent time to get into the significance of such a verse. We may have just read it and taken it for granted. We may not have considered what the forgiveness of sins is or what it comprises. Previously we may have understood the inheritance to be a heavenly mansion which we would inherit in the future. What is it to be sanctified? What is it to have faith in Him? We took these matters for granted as if we understood everything. This is the vision that Paul received from the heavens, which he carried out for so many years. When he was arrested by the Jews and defended himself before King Agrippa, he declared that from the time he had received the vision until then, he was never disobedient to this heavenly vision. This vision was the very ground, the very vigor, and the very content of this apostle&rsquo;s ministry. He ministered based upon this vision, he ministered with vigor by this vision, and he ministered by taking this vision as his goal. This vision enabled him to withstand any kind of persecution and opposition, and this vision enabled him never to have any change or deviation. He was bold to tell Agrippa that he had never disobeyed this vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESTRAINING VISION</h2>
<p>Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint&rdquo; (ASV). The King James Version says &ldquo;the people perish,&rdquo; the New American Standard Version says &ldquo;the people are unrestrained,&rdquo; and the Berkeley Version says &ldquo;the people run wild.&rdquo; All these different renderings refer to people who are not governed, directed, ruled, or restrained. To cast away any kind of restraint means you are unwilling to be restrained, to be ruled. The King James translation of this verse, which says &ldquo;the people perish,&rdquo; actually refers to the result or issue of casting off restraint and being unruly. The result is that you perish. Surely, if we take the way of having no vision, we will perish. This corresponds with the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 7:14: &ldquo;For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life.&rdquo; Constricted means ruling or governing. A person can drive many places in the United States, but his driving must be restrained by the white lines on the road. If you do not drive in a governed way, either you will perish or others will perish. The history of Christianity is a history of people driving with no restraint, with no vision. The second half of Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.&rdquo; The law is the restraint, the ruling. You may have the law yet not see the law to have a vision. The Jews of the Old Testament had the law, but not everyone saw the vision. One who has the law but does not see the law to have a vision will run wild. Where there is no vision, the people run wild.</p>
<p>At this time, we must review our vision at least once more. No doubt, we have to thank the Lord for His mercy that we all are here. We have received much mercy and we have experienced much grace. Still we need to strengthen and stress our vision at least once more. What can we say concerning the Lord&rsquo;s vision in His recovery? What would we tell people that we have seen in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? If we do not have a vision, we become so common. We become those doing just another piece of Christian work. Since the reformation, such common works have been raised up again and again in many places. Today many different Christian works are all around us. Are we going to add to this number of common and even good Christian works? Shall we preach the gospel in the common way, go to the mission fields to be a missionary, open up a school to teach the Bible, put out some papers to expound the holy Word, or set up some meetings to gather the seeking ones to worship, serve, and edify each other? All these are quite common. If we intend to do this then we had better close our halls. To be here in this way without a controlling vision would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Although I can never compare myself with the Apostle Paul, I cannot deny that I have seen a vision. I would die for this vision. So many dear ones all advise me to rest, but I do not care for my life. I prefer to live and to die for my commission that I may finish my course. I would endeavor to exhaust my entire being until I die. The Scriptures say in Psalm 90 that human life, generally speaking, is up to seventy years of age, and that if you are strong you may live to be eighty (v. 10). At the age of eighty-one, I am beyond the age that the Scriptures define for a man&rsquo;s lifetime. My wife frequently reminds me that I am over eighty and that I need to take care of myself. Many times, I rested in order to take care of her. The reason that I labor both day and night is because of the heavy burden of the vision. I am a small man and I have no degree, no fame, no position, and no rank. Yet even the angels can testify for me that I have really seen something. I have seen something not only for the recovery, but for the entire aggregate of all Christians. I am so sorrowful for the present ignorance among the Catholics, among the Protestants, and among you all. This is my burden, dear saints. Because I have seen the vision, I just cannot spare myself.</p>
