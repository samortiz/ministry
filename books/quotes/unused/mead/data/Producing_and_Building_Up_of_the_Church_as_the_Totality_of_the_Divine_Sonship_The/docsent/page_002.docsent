   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE CHURCH, THE TOTALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE SONSHIP Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4-5, 7, 9, 20-23; 3:8-11, 14-21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians reveals the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Epistle is high, deep, and profound, and in it the apostle Paul uses extraordinary terms and expressions to utter what was on his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we spend time to consider these expressions, we will know Paul s thought in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>CHOSEN IN CHRIST TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>HOLY AND WITHOUT BLEMISH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 1:4 says, Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God chose us, selected us, not in ourselves but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our being chosen does not depend on what we are or what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It depends on what Christ is, what He has done, and what He will do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we look at ourselves superficially, we may be proud, but if we consider ourselves in an honest way, we will be thoroughly disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>None of us is worthy of God s selection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, God selected us, not in ourselves, in our situation, or in our sphere but in Christ as the means, the sphere, the condition, and the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is everything for God s selection of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God selected us not only before we were born but also before the foundation of the world, even before the creation of the heavens, the earth, and Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only God Himself was there in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When nothing had yet come into existence, God made a selection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A person can select only those things that he sees.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This proves that in eternity past, even before we came into existence, God saw all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may wonder how this can be.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With human beings there is the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In all our homes we have clocks and watches; we are very much controlled by time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With God, however, there is no limitation of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eternity past, eternity future, and today are all the same to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His eternal nature, God is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a wonderful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our salvation was not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was something planned and purposed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In that plan God selected us, not in ourselves but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God chose us to be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A blemish is an imperfection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A good piece of wool, for example, may be free from any blemish in its color, texture, size, and design.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to our improper concept, we may think that God chose us in Christ to be free simply from perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even until now this may be our subconscious thought.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may say, Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He chose me before the foundation of the world to be saved from perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, this is not the Lord s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His thought is that we should be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be holy is to be separated unto God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has chosen us that we should be separated unto Him and for Him for His purpose and be without any blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is a God of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything that is imperfect has nothing to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we should look at Him, not at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not in ourselves; we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In ourselves we are imperfect, but in Christ we are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s recovery is to recover us back to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We were chosen in Christ to be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because of our fallen state, our concept regarding our present, our future, and our ultimate destiny is always according to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we must all declare that it is possible for us to be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes the young people are not able to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They often turn the question to me, asking, Do you believe that you can be holy and without blemish?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With us this is impossible, but there is no impossibility with the Lord; with Him everything is possible Matt 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God could create us, can He not make us holy?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To be sure, He can make us holy, perfect, and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, whether we are good or bad, wonderful or pitiful, or in heaven or in hell does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must not look at ourselves according to ourselves, and neither should we consider the brothers according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all need to consider one another according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to say, This brother is holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not care to hear how unholy or worldly he is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day he will be absolutely holy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he is not holy today, he is in the process of becoming holy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God can do it, and He will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We believe that all the dear saints will be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are holy brothers and holy sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In ourselves we are poor, unholy, and full of imperfections; therefore, we must look at one another according to Christ and say, Hallelujah, here is a brother in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because there is nothing unholy or imperfect in Christ, we are all holy in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do not believe this now, one day we will believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the New Jerusalem we may look at one another and be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We may recall the time that we considered one another and could not believe that we were holy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then we will say, Praise the Lord, holy brother.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our being holy is not according to ourselves but according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The book of Ephesians is different from the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The beginning of Romans reveals a pitiful situation in which we were all sinners and were all condemned 1:18 3:20 , but in Ephesians 1 we are not condemned but chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Ephesians begins not with us but with God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish.</S>
