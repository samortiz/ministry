   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIX</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Subjectivity can be expressed through the smallest things in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a nature, a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a man's subjectivity is dealt with by the Lord, he will show a marked difference in the numerous small actions of his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A subjective man is subjective in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He likes to control others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He likes to give his opinions, issue orders, and tell one to do this and another to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A subjective man has a solution for every problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a young worker of the Lord is put together with a few other brothers, you will immediately know whether or not he is a subjective person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If he is by himself, you cannot tell anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as soon as there are two persons, you will see that the one who is subjective always will try to be on top of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will want to have a say in what to eat and what not to eat, what to wear and what not to wear, where to sleep and where not to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He will always insist on this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is omniscient and omnipotent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When two sisters are put in a room, we can tell immediately if one of them is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If both of them are subjective, they will not get along with each other at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If one is subjective, perhaps they can get along with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If both are subjective, neither one will be able to get along with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This does not mean that we should keep our mouth shut from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If difficulties arise in the work or problems arise with the workers, we have to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What I am saying is that after we have spoken and others have chosen to ignore our word, we should not force anything upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not feel hurt when others will not take our word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people treasure their own ideas too much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When others will not take their word, they feel hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reaction of a subjective person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to be faithful, we have to say many things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we do not say them because we are interested in meddling with others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not say them because our temperament or habit compels us to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not have to speak every time the opportunity arises.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can speak when there is a need, but we do not have to make a rule that we must speak all the time, nor do we have to make a habit of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is wrong to speak whenever an opportunity arises.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is wrong to speak with an undisciplined tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has not appointed us to be the teacher of all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some people are used to speaking and teaching others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This clearly shows that they are very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a man's subjectivity is not broken, it is hard for him to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A subjective man is not necessarily a faithful man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A faithful man speaks because he has to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not speak because he likes to speak or because he has a lust for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A faithful man speaks because he does not want others to fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not speak out of a lust for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a faithful man finds that his words are rejected, he does not feel dejected; he can turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But a subjective man is different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has a lust to speak, and if he does not speak, he feels unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has a habit of opening his mouth every time he sees something.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A subjective man speaks because he likes to speak; he likes to impose his will upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He likes to dominate others with his ideas and have others listen to his words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A subjective person finds it difficult to accept the rejection of his will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, a subjective man is totally different from a faithful man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many times, it is wrong if we do not open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we must differentiate between faithfulness and subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A subjective person likes to meddle with others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He likes others to listen to his words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He likes to control others in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He gives orders to this person and directions to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He considers his methods the first and the best, and his ways the most perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wants everybody to take his way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many subjective persons cannot stand differences in others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, a subjective person is the narrowest kind of person in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A man can only be broad and generous after he has been dealt with by the Lord and his subjectivity has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only a broad person can tolerate those who are different from themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Subjectivity demands uniformity; it demands sameness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It cannot tolerate differences in others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If two subjective persons are put in a room, there will not be peace in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One wants to do one thing and the other wants to do another thing, and the room will be filled with arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One will think that he is bearing the cross, and the other will also think that he is bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Both are having problems with the other, and both think that they are bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is what happens when two subjective heads are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A subjective person always tries to take things in his hand; he wants to establish himself as the leader among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He makes instant decisions on how things should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A subjective person likes to meddle in the smallest affair.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He likes to interfere, to control.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is a basic problem with a subjective person.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We know that God will not entrust things to such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have never seen God entrusting things to a subjective person.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God cannot use such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have never seen a subjective person who has traveled any considerable length spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His disposition blocks him from receiving any instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A disposition that refuses to be instructed is unteachable and useless.</S>
