   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By being filled in our spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we are also subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A life of subjection is a life of being filled in spirit and of speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we speak, sing, praise, and give thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are willing to submit ourselves to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will submit to Christ as the Head and also to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this submitting comes from speaking, singing, psalming, and giving of thanks, which in turn come from infilling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we are filled in our spirit, we sing, psalm, speak, and give thanks; we also submit spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are not filled, there will be no speaking, singing, psalming, or thanking of God; consequently, there will be no submission.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians emphasizes the need of spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Colossians emphasizes that we should hold Christ as our Head and take Him as our life by having His rich word dwelling in us so that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we live in union with Christ by letting His word saturate us, Christ will be expressed through our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, our living as believers in union with Christ should result in the expression of Christ in our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we realize this, we will praise the Lord for our human living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In relationships between wife and husband, between children and parents, and between slave and master, we need to express Christ by being filled in spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ saturate us.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is an aspect of the daily living of those who are filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when we speak about the relationship between wives and husbands, we should not neglect the infilling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can have a proper married life only by being filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Ephesians 5:22 Paul says, Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning this matter, Colossians 3:18 says, Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wives need to be subject to their own husbands, no matter what kind of husbands they are.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ s being the Head is a matter of authority, whereas His being the Savior is a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must be subject to Him as our Head, and we must love Him as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It should be the same in the relationship between wives and husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verse 24 Paul says, As the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The thought here is that even though husbands are not the savior of their wives in the way that Christ is the Savior of the church, wives still need to be subject to their husbands as the church is to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Wives being subject to the husband is the result of being filled in spirit by the Spirit and saturated by the word of Christ.</S>
