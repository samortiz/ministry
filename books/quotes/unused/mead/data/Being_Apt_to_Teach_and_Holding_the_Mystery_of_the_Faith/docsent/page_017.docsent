   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two Kinds of Isolation in Service</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In serving, one may have the deep experience of feeling isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two reasons why one may have this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One reason is that as we are advancing spiritually, others may be unable to keep pace with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, we become isolated even though this is not our desire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A negative reason is that there is some factor in us that makes us unable to coordinate with others or that makes others unable to coordinate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, we become isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we feel isolated not because we desire to be isolated but because others are not able to keep pace with us, then there is nothing wrong with our feeling isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if we are isolated because we have a problem with coordination, then there is something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although this feeling is not a good feeling, it is nonetheless deep and real.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This feeling that causes us to be aware of our problems is a feeling that a serving one should experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life Issuing in Spontaneous Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must realize that there are two kinds of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One kind is the coordination involved in outward arrangements such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the chairs, and dusting the windows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of coordination is not very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The other kind of coordination is a coordination that grows out of the life within and is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This coordination is deeper and more real.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kind of coordination requires that our natural being, the world, our disposition, and our flesh all be dealt with so that the Lord can grow out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He grows out of you and me, we are spontaneously in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Coordination Making Our Self Manifest</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While learning to serve the Lord, many have had the experience that as soon as they were put in the coordination their condition was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When they were at home praying, reading the Word, or pursuing the Lord, they did not sense their own condition very much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they went out by themselves to preach the gospel and distribute gospel tracts, they also were not very conscious of their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, once they began to serve together with the saints, their self immediately became manifest, particularly in their opinions, because opinions are the best representative of a person's self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many schools hold three-legged races during field day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this race, the legs of two schoolmates are tied together, one student's right leg being tied to the other student's left leg.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, two persons with four legs become two persons with three legs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the two do not coordinate properly in the race, for example, if one walks quickly while the other walks slowly, then they will not only be unable to walk but might even fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then they may begin to blame each other.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Similarly, until two persons are put together in coordination, they will not realize how strong they are in their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we are put in coordination with the saints, we discover how much of the self we have and how strong we are in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Coordination Being Mainly Not for Right or Wrong but for Dealing with Our Self and Individualism</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose five of us are serving in coordination to dust the chairs, and suddenly I suggest that we turn the chairs over with the legs pointing upward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How would you react?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This would be a test to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Immediately opinions and thoughts would rise up from within you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must realize that the most important thing in the church service is not that we perform our tasks successfully.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, the important matter in our serving together in coordination is how much our flesh, our disposition, and our individualism are being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we who serve the Lord are coordinating together, the main thing is that our flesh and our disposition are dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The emphasis of our service in coordination is not on whether a certain matter is right or wrong nor on whether the reason behind a matter is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, the emphasis is on whether or not our person is right and on whether or not the life is right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the service of the church, to be able to bear responsibility together for a year or so without any opinions is a rare and commendable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Usually, in order to keep opinions out of the service, everybody tries to be polite to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, when we become truly serious in bearing a certain responsibility, our opinions quickly come out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason is that our flesh and disposition have not been broken, and the Lord has not yet touched our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a common Chinese saying: "Politeness maintains peace, but seriousness creates hostility."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church service, if we can refrain from being angry when the brothers get serious with us, this indicates that our flesh has been dealt with to a great extent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the book of Galatians, when Paul saw that what Peter did was inconsistent with the truth of the gospel, he rebuked him to his face 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Both of them were very serious, but neither of them turned hostile toward the other.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The biggest reason the church service is not strong and does not have much blessing is that the reality of coordination is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our coordination in service has to be so real that it surpasses human organization and is as organic as the human body.</S>
