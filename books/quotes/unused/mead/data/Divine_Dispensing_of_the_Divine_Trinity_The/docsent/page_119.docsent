   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIC FACTOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians we have all the functions of the members of the Body, and in chapter fourteen we see that the functions are for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then in chapter fifteen we have what we may call the basic factor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This chapter does not speak of gifts or functions; however, it does reveal the basic factor of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ Having Died for Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 15:3 Paul says, For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ s death for our sins, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament Isa 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa 22:14-18; Dan 9:26; Isa 53:9; Psa 16:9-10; Hos 6:2 , are the basic items among the first things of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ Having Been Raised Up by God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>from among the Dead as the Firstfruit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 15:4 Paul continues, And that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Scriptures in verses 3 and 4 denote the Old Testament, that is, the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of the three matters mentioned here Christ s death, His burial, and His resurrection the last is the most vital, for it imparts life so that we may live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 20 Paul says, But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 23 Paul again speaks of Christ as the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ was the first One raised from among the dead as the firstfruit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was typified by the firstfruits a sheaf of the firstfruits, including Christ with some of the dead Old Testament saints, was raised at the Lord s resurrection Matt 27:52-53 in Leviticus 23:10-11, offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection Matt 28:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as the firstfruit of resurrection is the Firstborn from among the dead to be the Head of the Body Col 1:18; Eph 1:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, shall also be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the Last Adam</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Having Become a Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapter fifteen reveals not only that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried, and that He was resurrected to become the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This chapter also reveals that Christ as the last Adam has become in resurrection a life-giving Spirit: So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Adam became a living soul through creation with a soulish body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, in incarnation, Christ became flesh for redemption John 1:14, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had a soulish body like Adam through incarnation; He has a spiritual body through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His soulish body has become a spiritual one through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now He is a life-giving Spirit in resurrection, with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we become one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our spirit is made alive and resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually our present soulish body will also become a spiritual body in resurrection, just as His body is vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>52-54; Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God Giving Us the Victory</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>through Our Lord Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1 Corinthians 15:57 Paul declares, But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This victory is the victory over sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a victory by Christ s death and resurrection should not be merely an accomplished fact for our acceptance; it must also become our daily experience in life by the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who is one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we should live by this mingled spirit and walk according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, many thanks will be continuously given to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because we believe in Christ and participate in Him, we have an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result, we enjoy His victory over sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have Christ as the firstfruit and as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we may enjoy His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This makes it possible for us to function in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we enjoy Christ s victory, we can speak for Christ and we can speak forth Christ in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This speaking opens the way for the Spirit to function, for the Lord to minister, and for God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity will take place continually, and the church will receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issuing in the functions of the members in a local church.</S>
