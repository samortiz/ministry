   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A living that is according to the Spirit does not follow any fixed rule.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All dead rules are set aside, and one seeks after God's will directly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After my servant finished cleaning the floor, he did not know what to do next.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When twelve o'clock came, he did not know if I wanted to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the way one lives when he is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He moves when he has the revelation of the Spirit and waits on the Lord otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How do we know if a person is saved and ready for baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can quiz him about the truth concerning salvation and baptism, and he may answer everything correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we then say that he is eligible for baptism, we are acting according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose there is an old lady from the countryside who cannot read or say any of the biblical terms.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She cannot answer any question concerning regeneration, repentance, or forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet she has the peace in her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Should we baptize her?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The issue is not whether the candidate for baptism will pass our test and answer our questions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The issue is whether or not she is regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many village folks do not know any terminology, yet they have peace and joy inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such ones may not understand anything in their mind, but they are genuinely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At our Lord's table meeting in Shanghai, we often have visitors joining us unannounced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How long should we ask them to wait before we invite them to break bread with us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Should they wait a week or a month?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, if we know that a person is saved, we can invite him to break bread with us immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The co-workers must never lay down any laws.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to allow the Holy Spirit to operate and work within each person separately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything in the Bible is living, but it is living only when it is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we make a thing an ordinance, it immediately becomes dead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The truth of the Bible must be realized in the Spirit; only then will it be living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In conducting conferences, we sometimes receive a message from the Lord and speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This may result in the salvation of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the next time we conduct another conference, we may think that we should do the same since so many were saved last time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may then proceed to deliver the same message, and to our surprise no one is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We think that if a message saves people one time, it will save people all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the result is not what we expect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A message saves people when it is delivered in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same message repeated according to the law will not save anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here lies the difference between walking according to the Spirit and walking according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything that is not done according to the living guidance of the Spirit is a kind of law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We often take yesterday's leading as today's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But applying yesterday's guidance to today is to walk according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not think that just because the Spirit was leading us a certain way in the past that He will lead us the same way today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Imitating the leading of yesterday is being in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is even possible to walk according to the law in obeying the biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we want to be baptized just because the Bible says so rather than as a result of the leading of the Spirit within, we are following the law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must walk according to the Scripture, but our leading is only proper when this walk is confirmed by the inner guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If anyone says that something is right because the Bible has never said that it is wrong, he is completely in the realm of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people write to me to ask if this or that is right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I write back and ask whether they have the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they do, they should learn to follow the inner guidance of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not a fortune-teller or a diviner; I cannot know God's will for you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to learn to know the inner guidance of the Spirit yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In learning to follow the guidance of the Spirit, we have to ask what the Spirit is saying before we ask what the Bible is saying.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first thing we should ask is what the inner registration is telling us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, most people today first ask what the Bible says and do not ask what the Spirit within says.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A New Testament believer has the Holy Spirit residing within.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a precious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to learn to know the inner leading of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is a difference between the principles and commandments in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A believer must not only obey the commandments in the Bible, but also walk according to the principles that are behind the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Consider the matter of the head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you cover your head merely because 1 Corinthians 11 says so, you have not covered your head in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unless a man obeys the Bible according to the leading of the Spirit, his obedience is the same as his disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The main thing is what the Lord is saying within a person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the Lord is leading you to obey a certain truth in the Bible, and you act accordingly, this is true obedience to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the Old Testament there was the dispensation of the law, but today we are in the New Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet there are still too many "Jews" in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They keep the law and make the Bible a book of laws.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many people ask others what they think of this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that they do not know how to ask the Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>BEING CONFIRMED BY THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every sheep knows its shepherd's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people think that if they do not know the letter of the Bible, they will not know how to live.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Does this mean that they will sin every day?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In actuality, if we follow the leading of the Spirit, we will experience just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is much better to follow the leading of the Spirit than to follow the Bible alone.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can forget, but the Holy Spirit will not forget.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We may ask, "If the work of the Holy Spirit is so crucial, does this mean that we do not need the Bible anymore?"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Theoretically, the leading of the Holy Spirit within is good enough, but in following this inner leading, it is possible for us to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, we still need the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In other words, we are not following the leading of the Bible; we are following the leading of the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, we are checking this daily inner leading with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only when we obey both the inner leading and the outward leading are we truly obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We cannot obey only the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must follow the leading of the Spirit within and then compare it with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If the leading cannot be confirmed by the Bible, it is not a leading from the Spirit but a work of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The real issue is the inward registration.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In Chefoo two people asked me if they should leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I answered, "I do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They said, "Does this mean that you are opposed to us leaving the denominations?"</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then I asked them, "How does the life in you feel when you are in the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Do you feel that the life within is blossoming when you stay in the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you feel that way, you should stay in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If not, you should leave."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is absolutely not a question of right or wrong but a question of life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>There was a famous Western missionary in Chefoo who came three times to discuss the question of sects with me.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The first two times I avoided her and did not talk with her about the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The last time she came she insisted on talking about it.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I felt that there was the leading of the Spirit, and I talked with her for five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After our talk we sat down for tea.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I told her that I was in a big circle, but that she was in a small circle within the big circle.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After our talk, I escorted her out.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Two days later, she came to me early in the morning and said, "Last night I sent out three letters of resignation."</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I told her, "You should not be influenced by me.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Such a matter can only be decided by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Only God can call you out of a denomination."</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>She said, "I inquired of God last night and saw that the small circle within the big circle is man's choice and that man's choice is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I felt that it is God's will that I should leave my denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>That is why I got up last night and wrote the letters of resignation."</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I shook her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>From that point on, she began to go on positively in the way of the Lord and was not bothered by any negative element.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As workers for the Lord we should be careful not to lead others merely according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should allow the Holy Spirit to personally guide them from within.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We do not need to make all the saints identical according to some outward standards or to maintain some outward order.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we do this, the Holy Spirit will not have the ground or the freedom to work.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We must not be a Moses, dispensing letters and the law to others.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Our law is just the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He is our absolute guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We have to learn to follow the guidance of the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If a man keeps the law, he can go on without God.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But if a man lives by the Spirit, he will not be able to leave God for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Once he leaves God, he will die.</S>
