   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said, "For to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since he could declare this, he could also say, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20a , and he could say, "We also should walk in newness of life" Rom 6:4 , in the realm of the newness of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Ephesians 4:23 Paul said, "And are being renewed in the spirit of your mind."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be renewed in the spirit of our mind is inward and intrinsic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we learn to be renewed in this way, we will have a deeper perception with which to understand persons and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To understand a person requires that we have a deeper sight, a perception that goes farther and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Often our knowing of people is shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We lack the perception that penetrates the barriers and coverings because we do not practice being daily renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The renewing in the spirit of our mind always revolutionizes our logic, philosophy, thought, concept, and psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, our perception in all things is different, and we have a deeper understanding of the people we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even by the way they ask questions we can know people's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A natural man is a very shallow man, but if we are spiritual, we will be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are deep, we will know others, even though they will not be able to know us 1 Cor 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 8:4b says, "Who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To walk in this verse implies everything in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It implies our speaking and even the way we look at people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes the way we look at others, speak to them, or shake their hand is peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as we do not walk according to spirit, whatever we do or say is our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must learn to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>APPLYING THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must always apply the cross to ourselves and to everything that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason why we are peculiar in everything, in every way, and in every aspect is that we do not take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus told us to take up our cross Matt 10:38 and carry our cross Luke 14:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cross has to remain with us to exercise its killing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are under the killing of the cross, our speaking and our talking on the telephone will be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we go to visit people for the gospel after talking too much on the telephone, we will not have the power or impact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the other hand, if we check and are stopped when we are about to make a phone call, we will have an impact when we go out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we take the cross and apply the cross to our being, the Spirit will fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Question: How can I know if I am merely performing or practicing a behavior when I apply the cross to my living and hesitate before I say or do something?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Answer: As long as we simply walk according to spirit, our hesitating is life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not walk according to spirit, whatever we do will not be life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To walk according to spirit first implies the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are not under the killing of the cross, we cannot walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To make a phone call whenever we want to is of ourselves; it is not according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we hesitate and say, "Lord, is this I or You?" the answer will come: "It is you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we then stop, we are under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The cross is applied to us and kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then spontaneously the Spirit follows the cross, and whatever we do and however we walk is life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not practice this, however, whatever we do is a performance and mere outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After speaking much about spiritual matters in the book of Romans, a book on the Christian life, Paul concluded in chapter eight with walking according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are a tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Accordingly, we may walk according to our flesh or according to our soul, that is, according to our mind, will, or emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not walk according to these, however, but according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we practice this, we will be helped in attaining to all the spiritual requirements.</S>
