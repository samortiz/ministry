<h2 class=head2>B. As Revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18</h2><p>[In Matthew 16:18 we have the Lord’s first mentioning of the church. In this verse He says, “On this rock I will build My church.’’ What is revealed here is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe.<p>The universal church is to be built by Christ, the Son of the living God revealed by the Father. When Peter declared that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said to Him, “You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens’’ (Matt. 16:17). Only the Father knows the Son (Matt. 11:27) and can reveal the Son to us. The Son revealed by the Father is now building the universal church, not the church in a nation or the church in a city.]<p>The universal church is to be built on the rock of the revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the living God. This revelation is the crucial factor, the central point of the building up of the universal church. The church is not to be built up according to any doctrine, creed, or so-called belief.<p>The gates of Hades, Satan’s power of darkness, shall not prevail against the church. Rather, the church has the keys of the kingdom of heaven. That means the church has the authority to bind the devil and to loose all God’s people for His church. Hallelujah! How glorious and powerful is the church.<h2 class=head1>III. THE LOCAL ASPECT</h2><p>The other aspect of the church is the local aspect. It is important to see the universal aspect. It is equally important to see the local aspect. Many Christians see very little concerning the universal church. Others may see something concerning the universal aspect of the church, yet they do not regard the local aspect of the church to be important.<h2 class=head2>A. The Believers Living in the Local Churches</h2><p>In order to live in the universal church practically, we have to live in the local churches. [Actually, we cannot live directly in the universal church. It is impossible for us to live in the universal church without living in a local church. The Lord is building up the universal church, and each of us is living practically in a local church. In Matthew 18:17 the Lord said that if, as a believer, you have a problem with another believer, you should tell it to the church. Surely the church mentioned in this verse is not the universal church; it must be the church in the place where you are. If you are in Seoul and you have any problem, you should tell the problem to the church in Seoul. If you are in Pusan, you should go to the church in Pusan; if you are in Hong Kong, you should go to the church in Hong Kong; and if you are in New York, you should go to the church in New York. The church to which you should tell your problem is the local church.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Local Churches Being the Local Expressions of the Body of Christ</h2><p>[The local churches are the local expressions of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 2:22). There is only one Body, but there are many expressions. Universally, all the churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of that universal Body. A local church is not the Body; it is only a part of the Body. It is a local expression of the Body. The church in Seoul is not the entire Body; it is a part of the entire Body as the Body’s local expression.]<h2 class=head2>C. All the Local Churches Constituting the One Body of Christ</h2><p>[All the local churches constitute the one Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4). In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, “I will build My church.’’ Here the church is in the singular number, indicating that it must be the universal church. But in the Acts and the Epistles, a number of times the Bible says “the churches’’—the churches in Syria, the churches in Asia, the churches in Macedonia, and the churches in Galatia. How could the Bible refer first to one church and then to many churches? It is because the one church, the universal church, is the totality of all the churches, and all the churches are local constituents of the one universal church.]
