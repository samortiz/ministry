   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Between Man's Soul and the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 16:26 says, "For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here a comparison is made between man's soul and the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is the soul more precious or the world more precious?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people see the preciousness of the world, but they do not see the preciousness of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today Satan is trying to buy man's soul, but many people are giving away their soul for free.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because they do not believe their soul is worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prodigal son in Luke 15 did not leave his father's house because of the enticement of a grand feast; he succumbed to mere carob pods.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How worthless is the soul in the eyes of an unbeliever!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the Lord says that the whole world put together cannot be exchanged for a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan offered a high price when he took the Lord to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In exchange for His worship, the Lord would have been given all these things by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the only instance in the Bible where Satan offered a high price for man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, he did not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose Satan did the same thing again and offered the whole world to any man who would worship him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What would anyone choose?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is altogether a matter of valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Should a man give up his soul to gain the world or should he give up the world to gain his soul?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today Satan is not offering to exchange the whole world for our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not think that our life is worth that much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is enticing us with small benefits and small gains.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many children of God would lie for the sake of five catties of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They would forsake the Lord's way for just a little gain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is like Balaam who degraded himself for profit to curse God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to show the new ones that honesty is worth more than gold, rice, or the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to preserve the purity of our soul, we should be willing to forsake anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should teach the new ones properly at the very beginning of their Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should help them to have a change in their concept of value.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should bring them to the proper pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is very important, and the responsibility is on us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Between the Body and Sin</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew 18:8-9 says, "If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see another contrast in valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man can relinquish the love for the world, but he may not be able to relinquish the love for his body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Job 2:3 and 10 show how Job was able to maintain his integrity when he was first tempted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Satan came to him the second time, he attacked Job's body, and Job began to curse the day he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He failed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows us that a man loves his body very much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Matthew 18 the Lord shows us a solution with regard to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If preserving the body means preserving sin, we have to realize that it is better to give up the body than to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means it is more serious to stumble than to sacrifice the body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A believer must have a change in his concept of value.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He must see the seriousness of stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before a person believes in the Lord, he can commit many sins and set his eyes on many filthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After he believes in the Lord, his hands and eyes must be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He must be shown the grave consequence of sin from the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Cutting off the hand and plucking out the eyes are only illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The real significance is that one should sever sin even if this means enduring as much pain as the severing of hands, feet, or eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A Christian has to realize the seriousness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He should deal with sin as drastically as severing the parts of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This preserves his own sanctity and purity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning Position</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matthew 20:25-27 says, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is something that is practiced among the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Among believers, however, this practice should not be allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whoever wants to become great should be a servant, and whoever wants to be first should be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a change in valuation, a change in one's view concerning position.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before a person believes in the Lord, he has high esteem for rulers, and he considers the great ones the heroes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But after he believes in the Lord, he has to consider a servant as a great one, and a slave as a preeminent one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He should despise the position of lords and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should have a change in our concept of position.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should treasure servants and slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The concept of value which the Lord put in us is one which exalts and magnifies those who serve the most.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The reason there are squabbles for recognition in the church is that worldly concepts have crept in. If everyone in the church regards servants and slaves as great and noble, many of the problems in the church will go away, and the church will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This does not mean that we want all the new believers to become servants and slaves, but it does mean that a man's concept of value must change when he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He must be willing to be a servant and a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He has to be shown clearly that only servants and slaves are great and prominent.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The central theme of the Christian faith involves a change in valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If every new believer can experience this change in concept, the church will have a free way to go on.</S>
