 <h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO BOTH LIFE AND WORK</h2>
<p>Before the change of system, we were lacking in matters such as gospel activities, shepherding people, and group meetings. This does not mean that since we currently have many activities, we can neglect the emphasis on life. The whole church still needs to pay attention to the matter of life; the elders and co-workers especially need to take the lead to pursue life and grow in life. John 15 shows that Christians need to bear fruit (vv. 2, 4-5, 8). Our going out to gain people is to bear fruit; fruit-bearing depends on the riches of life within, and the fruit is the issue of the outflow of the life within. It is difficult for us to be balanced before the Lord. We tend to either lean toward one side or the other. We are like a cake not turned (Hosea 7:8). We tend to bake only one side; thus, in the end one side is burned, and the other is still uncooked. This is improper. We must take care of both sides, turning to this side and to the other side. Hence, we need to pay attention to life and to work; we need to focus on the growth in life and on bearing abundant fruit. These two matters need to be balanced; we cannot focus only on one side. If we lean toward one side, we will surely suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESPERATENESS AND URGENCY IN PRAYER</h2>
<p>We also need adequate prayer. In the past we have been short in the matter of prayer; we did not have adequate prayer. For example, according to Genesis 2:5, once man tills the ground, God sends the rain. Today we have tilled the ground but there is little rain; this requires our prayer. Regarding this point, I have some special fellowship for the co-workers and full-timers. Since you have more time than the other saints, you should learn to spend more time to pray. The brothers and sisters serving full time do not have the same time constraints as the working saints. Though the working saints have the heart, it is difficult for them to find the time. Hence, the full-time serving brothers and sisters should learn to pray and must realize that prayer is the first crucial matter in the work. Every day you need to set aside a period of time to pray. You should aspire to have a prayer life.</p>
<p>The elders and co-workers should spend much time in prayer. No matter how busy we are and how little time we have, we need to endeavor to tell the Lord all the burdens within us and pray before Him. If possible, all the churches should have one day a week to fast and pray. If the brothers and sisters are strong enough physically, they can fast. If not, do not force them. The saints may fast for a meal or two or even a whole day. This will increase the brothers and sisters&rsquo; feeling and burden for prayer. According to our studies and experiments, the new way is right. Nevertheless, the principle in the Scriptures is that we should always pray. When we do not pray, it seems that God cannot do that much. Hence, we need to cooperate with God&rsquo;s work through our prayer. In themselves, our studies, experiments, and various ways cannot help the saints&rsquo; feeling or strengthen their spirit; these matters require our prayer. Once we have prayer, we will need an outward practice. It is one thing to have the rain, but man still needs to till the ground. This is of two sides: we need to pray, and we also need to labor.</p>
<p>Our fellowship is not for the purpose of giving an order for all the churches to fast once a week. Rather, this matter depends upon the feeling of the responsible brothers. If these brothers have this burden, they can practice it in their locality. Some may not think that it is necessary to fast every week but will announce a fast as needs arise; this also is good. In short, we need to strengthen the prayer of the church. If we lack prayer, we will lack spiritual power. The source of spiritual power is prayer. When there is adequate prayer, power will come, and when there is adequate prayer, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will be upon us. Hence, the church needs to strengthen the prayer.</p>
<p>Beginning last October, everyone has been endeavoring in one accord, yet after laboring for half a year, we have not seen a rich result from the new way. Nevertheless, compared to the old way, the new way is more profitable. Why has the result of the new way not been so abundant? It is because there is a lack of rain, that is, a lack of the Holy Spirit and of the power of the Holy Spirit. In brief, our prayer is lacking; hence, we must pray. We desire that the elders go to the districts to promote and encourage this matter. Not only should a fast be announced to the elderly brothers and sisters who have retired, but they should be exhorted to always have the burden to fast and pray for the church.</p>
<p>Concerning this matter, I would like to give you some additional fellowship. Recently, I contacted a doctor, who told me that it is very healthy to skip a meal once a week. In the New Testament the Pharisees fasted twice a week (Luke 18:12). This surely has to do with the principle of the repetitive cycle of our physical body. It is absolutely beneficial to our body that we fast one day a week, skipping at least one meal, if not all three meals. Fasting not only enables the digestive system to rest properly but also enables the blood circulation to be cleansed. Hence, we should not be afraid to fast. It does not hurt to fast once or twice a week; rather, it is beneficial.</p>
<p>Those who have digestive ailments or a heart condition should not fast. We need to take care of our bodies. For the brothers and sisters with these conditions, their health is first, not prayer. As for the healthy saints, I hope that they will receive more burden. In the past, in a training for elderly saints we found that the elderly sisters were very strong in the matter of prayer; hence, they should promote the matter of prayer. The church needs to strengthen the prayer; it would not be too much if the amount of prayer were increased five times more than our current amount.</p>
<p>In the future we may announce a fast and encourage prayer on Tuesday afternoon before the evening prayer meeting. Then when we come together in the evening, we can continue to pray. The churches all over the globe, especially the churches in Taiwan, have not paid enough attention to the prayer meeting in the past few decades. This is reflected by the number of attendants in the meeting. The ratio of people attending the prayer meeting is too low, and this needs to be adjusted through much encouragement so that the brothers and sisters pay more attention to the prayer meeting and thus come to the prayer meeting. In this way the number attending will increase. The weight of the prayer of all the churches needs to be greatly increased. We need to see that the extent to which we pray is the extent to which God works. When we pray, God works.</p>
