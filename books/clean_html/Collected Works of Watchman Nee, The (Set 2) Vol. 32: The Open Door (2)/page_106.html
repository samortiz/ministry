<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Liao Ong Yu-bing</h2><p>The local church in Jien-Ou does not have official elders yet, but all the affairs have been taken up by local brothers and sisters. Sister Lee Mo-chai and I came to work in Shao. Our emphasis has been on personal evangelism, and there seems to be much enthusiasm. The Lord has blessed His work. The Lord has led us to do this particularly, and we are at peace about it. Indeed, we have experienced that those who nourish others will be nourished themselves! The brothers are not here yet, and we can only do miscellaneous work. I feel that I can leave the work in Jien-Ou behind now. After this summer Shao-yun and Jia-en will go elsewhere for high school, and I will be more free to serve the Lord.</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, May 17</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Bao Hsu-min</h2><p>Presently, transportation is difficult, and I do not know when I will have a free way to go to Shanghai. May He accomplish His best. Sister Mo-chai has returned to Ku-Tien, and I have returned from the country to the city. The Lord willing, I will go to Fu-Ding, Tai-Shun, and Ping-Yang by land and stay for a while. Brothers and sisters from Ping-Yang have written to me for a long time inviting me to come.</p><p>Sister Bao Hso-min, June 6</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Han Fu-shen</h2><p>I returned from Dong-Ping and stayed in Ch'ang-Teh for half a month. On April 16 I went to Chi-Li. The work along the way was blessed by the Lord. I conducted three meetings at the China Inland Mission in Tsou-Si. Missionary X and Mr. Shu were quite seeking. The missionary accompanied me to Jiu-Si, which is sixty-five miles away from Tsou-Si, and I preached at the Presbyterian Gospel Hall for three days. I arrived in Chi-Li on the twenty-third and had three evenings of meetings. Although the number was very small, the Lord did some definite work. Brother Shang is staying in Chi-Li. On the seventh we set off in sedan chairs and arrived in Da-Yung in two days. We met a few brothers for the first time, and it was a joy to fellowship with one another. Now we are in the process of renting a house for meeting use. Greetings to the workers and saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Han Fu-shen, May 5</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Lan Tsi-yi</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>By the Lord's sovereign arrangement, my family and I have moved to the upper floor of the meeting hall in Gospel Lane. The house is now being used in three ways. The church uses the first floor; I use a medium-size room; and the rest is used as temporary quarters for the orphanage, which can hold thirty people. In all the things we do, we see that the Lord's yoke is easy and His burden light.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi, May 31</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The work of the orphanage is progressing smoothly. I have now been put in a circumstance like that of Joseph. I am in trial and tribulation, yet I see God's presence and smooth leading in the things that are entrusted to my hands.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, June 16</p>
