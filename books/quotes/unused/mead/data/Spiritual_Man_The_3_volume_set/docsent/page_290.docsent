   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God instructs us that, even in such a great and wonderful thing as salvation, if it issues from the self, it will still not please God and will be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we want to advance in our spiritual life, we must understand all the principles God used to deal with us at the time we were saved because these original principles point out to us the principles we should live by in our spiritual life in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of the greatest principles is that the intention of our flesh does not have any value before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever comes out of ourselves, that is, out of our old creation, is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if we are pursuing after something as wonderful and important as salvation, it will still be rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should remember at all times that God does not care for the differences between good things, bad things, big things, and small things; God only asks where these things come from and whether or not they are initiated and carried out by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were not saved because we wanted to be saved, but because God wanted it to be so.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in our entire life we should see that all activities, even the most wonderful ones, are completely useless unless the work is done by God through us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not learn the principles for our living from the very first step of salvation, we will have endless failures afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As far as man's condition goes, while he was a sinner, his will was rebellious toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in addition to giving man a new life which we have covered before , God has to bring man back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as man's will is the essence of man himself, God's will is God Himself, the true life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, saying that God wants to bring man back to Himself is the same as saying that God wants to bring man's will back to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what the believer should endeavor to do his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even at the first step of salvation, God is working in this direction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when God, through the Holy Spirit, causes a man to be convicted of sin, He causes him to realize that he has nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if God condemns him and sends him to hell, there is nothing he can say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God reveals to man, through the gospel, His will on the cross of the Lord Jesus, He makes man say willingly and wholeheartedly, "I am willing to accept God's salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The initial step of man's salvation is the salvation of his will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A sinner's believing and receiving are nothing other than being one who "wills to take the water of life," resulting in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A sinner's objection and resistance are nothing other than being one who is "not willing to come to Him that he may have life," resulting in perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The battle between man's salvation and perdition is fought in man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man's fall in the beginning was due to the rebellion of his will against God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consequently, man's salvation is just the submission of his will to God's will again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although a man's will is not totally in union with God after he is saved, his fallen will was somewhat uplifted when he rejected Satan, self, and the world at the time he received the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, his will is renewed through believing in the Lord's word and through receiving God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After man is regenerated, he receives a new spirit, a new heart, and a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the will now has a new master and is controlled and directed by this master.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the will submits, it becomes a part of this new life; if it opposes, it becomes a strong enemy to this new life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The renewed will is more important than any other part of man the soul .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thoughts can be wrong, feelings can be wrong, but the will should never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever else is wrong is not as severe as the will being wrong, because the will is man's self as well as the faculty that motivates the whole man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once it becomes wrong, God's purpose will be frustrated immediately.</S>
