<h2 class="head2">Having Morning Revival<br />
to Enjoy the Lord Every Day</h2>
<p>The first thing we should do in our living is to get up early in the morning to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; and to enjoy two verses. Using these verses we may pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s word and fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living Christ Every Day</h2>
<p>Second, we should live Christ every day. Because we live on the earth and have received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we should be a testimony for the Lord. We should be a testimony for the Lord not only with our mouths but also in our living. The furnishings of our home should be elegant and proper, and our clothing should also be noble and graceful, neither luxurious nor too plain. Since we love the Lord, experience that He is true and living, and know that one day He will come back and that we will see Him, we should live Him in our lives and live out a genuine testimony of Him.</p>
<p>As we live in the communities, people are observing our condition. They pay attention to our comings and goings, our attire, and our adornment. If people are fashionable and love the world and we are the same as they, they may not regard us highly. On the contrary, suppose that they are fashionable but we are not and that they adorn themselves but we do not. Then when they encounter difficulties and want to commit an important matter to someone, they will first think of us, because they will clearly know in their hearts who the most proper and reliable people are. This should be our testimony. Thus, not only should we preach the gospel by door-knocking, we should also live out a testimony before our neighbors in our family life, in our comings and goings, in our speaking and attitude, and in our clothing, attire, and adornment. We should be a testimony for the Lord Jesus. We should be such ones.</p>
<p>If we have a proper living in this way, we will not need to do good deeds to benefit mankind, because our living in itself will be a benefit to society. Revelation 22:2 says, &ldquo;And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; The fruit of the tree of life is for food, and its leaves are for the healing of the nations. In the Bible leaves denote man&rsquo;s behavior, that is, his Christian behavior. Good behavior can heal man&rsquo;s corruption. If there are three households of saints living in an apartment building, and they come and go in a proper and modest manner, this will affect everyone in the apartment building. Such a testimony would be very helpful for the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knocking on Doors to Preach the Gospel and Everyone Speaking in the Home Meetings</h2>
<p>Third, if we want to preach the gospel and to preach the Lord Jesus, we need to be ready in season and out of season (2 Tim. 4:2). Some saints are already retired, so they can preach the gospel to their neighbors every day. We do not need to leave the apartment buildings in which we live. As long as we have time, we can knock on doors every day, and gradually the neighbors will know that we are their neighbors and will welcome us. When people open their doors for us, we should preach the Lord Jesus to them. The Lord Jesus should always be our topic. Today the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; are numerous, so we not only need to fish with a single line but also with a net. Sometimes, the fish may be so numerous that we ourselves may have to jump into the net. Hence, we should be more diligent in preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>Once a person believes in the Lord and receives the Lord, we should baptize him and go to his home to have home meetings with him. In the home meetings we should not wait for the leading brother to speak a message. Rather, every saint should speak. Unlike the past, we cannot remain silent, looking at one another and waiting for the leading one to speak. In the new way we all should practice preaching the gospel by door-knocking, leading the home meetings, and speaking in the meetings. If we all practice this way, I believe we all will bear new fruit each month and bring people to salvation. Once a person is saved, he is like a child that we have given birth to, and we need to take care of him and nourish him so that he may grow gradually. In this way the church will have offspring.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
