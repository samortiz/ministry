<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS—THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(52)</h1><p>We have seen that, in the progressing stage of God’s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ. The believers experience this dispensing also by putting on the new man and by wrestling against the Devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. With this message we shall begin to consider the believers’ experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God in other aspects.<h2 class=head2>5. Experiencing the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Other Aspects</h2><p>The believers experience the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity in various other aspects, including serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan, fighting the good fight, running the course of the race, being profited by all things in their circumstances and environments, having the best attitude toward others, and watching and praying. For all of these matters we surely need the dispensing of the divine Trinity. However, few Christians realize this. We need to see that in order to carry out these matters, we need God’s divine supply, which comes to us through His divine dispensing.<p>For all the requirements related to the believers revealed in the New Testament we need to receive the divine supply through the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God. Without this dispensing we cannot receive the supply, and without this supply we cannot fulfill the requirements mentioned in the New Testament. If we would meet what the New Testament requires of the believers, we need the divine supply, even the very essence of the Triune God.<p>In ourselves we cannot meet any of the divine requirements. For example, we cannot fulfill the requirement to worship God. Some may think that to worship God is easy and natural. Actually, no one can truly worship God without God’s dispensing of His element into him. We cannot render to God the worship that satisfies Him, that is accepted by Him as a real pleasure to Him, apart from the dispensing of the divine essence into our being. But through this divine dispensing we can worship God in a way that satisfies Him.<p>In like manner, apart from the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God, we cannot be humble or meek. The meekness required in the New Testament is much higher than that required by human teachings concerning morality, ethics, and human virtues. In society there are many teachings concerning such matters as humility, meekness, gentleness, and love. It may be easy to have these virtues in a way that is according to the natural, human concept. But to meet the requirements of humility, meekness, gentleness, and love as revealed in the New Testament is impossible by our natural being. We need another being—the being of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being and even constituted into our being. Then through this dispensing and constitution we shall be able to meet the requirements of humility, meekness, gentleness, and love as revealed in the New Testament. Therefore, it is altogether necessary for us to contact the processed Triune God that we may receive His supply through His dispensing of Himself into our being. We need to be reminded repeatedly of our need for the dispensing of the processed Triune God.
