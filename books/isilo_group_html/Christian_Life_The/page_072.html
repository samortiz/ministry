This was after His resurrection. Before His resurrection, there was no possibility of having the essential Spirit entering into our being, and no possibility of having the economical Spirit poured out upon us. Both of these matters took place based upon the fact that resurrection was consummated. It was the resurrection of Christ that made the Spirit available and applicable. His entering into us as the essential Spirit is for life, and His being poured out upon us as the economical Spirit is for power; these two aspects of the Spirit are the parts of the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>Acts is a book of the testimony of the resurrection of Christ. Acts mentions clearly that the disciples were witnesses (1:8), witnessing of the resurrection of Christ. Today, Christians preaching the gospel stress the death of Christ. But the early apostles, like Peter and Paul, stressed the resurrection of Christ in their preaching of the gospel. Of course, they also spoke of the death of Christ, but this death is not the consummation. The consummation is resurrection.</P><P>Resurrection is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God. God, Christ, and Christ's death and resurrection have been compounded into this one compound Spirit, who is the very reality of Christ's resurrection.</P><P>Resurrection is a person because Christ said that He is the resurrection. Life and light are also a person. Christ said that He is the life (John 14:6) and the light (John 8:12). Love is also a person. The Bible says that God is love (1 John 4:8, 16). But no verse says that Christ is death. We can say Christ's death, using the possessive case, because death is not the consummation. The consummation is resurrection. The processes through which the Triune God passed consummated in resurrection. Thus, resurrection is the very consummated God.</P><P>We must have a clear view of the resurrection. God is the resurrection, the resurrection is the compound Spirit, and the compound Spirit is the consummated God. This view of the resurrection is according to the divine revelation of the Holy Bible.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Christian Life &nbsp; pg 72</div><br></body></html>
