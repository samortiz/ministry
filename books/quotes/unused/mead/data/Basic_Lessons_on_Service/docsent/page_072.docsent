   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Lose Our Gift</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 25:28 and 29 say, "Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These verses show that we can lose our gift because of our slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not use our talent, the Lord will take it back from us when He comes back, and we will lose our gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not use our gift, this means that we waste it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. To Be Cast Out into the Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>outside of the Lord's Coming Glory</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The outer darkness is the darkness outside the Lord's coming glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 25:30; 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be cast out into the outer darkness is not to perish; it is to be dealt with dispensationally, to be disqualified from participating in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium, for not having lived by Christ an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the millennium the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom Col 3:4 , whereas the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we stress these points, some of the saints may be curious about what outer darkness is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should simply tell them that we have never been there, so we really cannot say what is there; but we surely know that this is not a good place to be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of darkness is not for the ones who will suffer eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those ones will spend eternity in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The outer darkness outside of the Lord's glory is neither the lake of fire nor the section of torment in Hades where all the perished sinners are Luke 16:26, 23a, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a place of dispensational punishment for the defeated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may say that this kind of teaching damages God's complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should tell them that we have received the Lord's complete salvation and we believe in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also believe that if we are not faithful to the Lord today, He may chastise us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord chastises us in this age, this chastisement does not damage His complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since this is the case, how could His chastisement in the next age damage His complete salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is illogical to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord told us that when He returns, He will chastise His unfaithful servants Luke 12:46-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not our word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to be faithful in teaching the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot cut off any verses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to present all the aspects of the Lord's word to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is wise to take heed to the Lord's warning Luke 21:34-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to impress the saints to take heed to the facts in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we have been regenerated by the Lord, we are gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has given us at least one talent, at least one spiritual gift.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not use this gift faithfully, we cannot be in the place that the apostle Paul will be at the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A saved person will not suffer eternally in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To say this is an insult to the Lord's redemption and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But a saved believer may suffer some dispensational chastisement in outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may be cut off from the Lord's presence in the manifestation of His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By that time the Lord's presence will be His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the defeated believers will have no share of the Lord's glory in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not only scriptural but also logical.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are living and walking in darkness today, how can we expect to participate in the Lord's bright glory in the next age?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we live in darkness today, we will be chastised in outer darkness in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this lesson we need to speak a practical word to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We admit that we all have been saved and have received a gift from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But do we use His gift?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are we faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this lesson we need to preach the gospel to the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This may help some of the brothers and sisters and stir them up to have a real hunger to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all need to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This word concerning the danger and loss of not using our gift is the word of our King.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible is not only composed of John 3:16 and Ephesians 2:8, which says that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible also includes Matthew 24 and 25, and we cannot neglect or put aside this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Fundamental Christianity shares the truth of John 3:16 and Ephesians 2:8, but they do not go on to share the truth revealed in Matthew 24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the teaching directly out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot deny that we are slaves of the Lord, and each slave of the Lord has been given a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now the problem is how we use this talent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to warn the saints that there is the danger and loss of not using our gift.</S>
