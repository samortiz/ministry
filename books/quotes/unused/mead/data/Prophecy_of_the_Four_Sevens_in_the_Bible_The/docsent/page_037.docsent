   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The earth today has really been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no present remedy to its unrighteous and evil situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, however, the Lord will sweep away all the evil persons and things into the lake of fire.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OF THREE AND A HALF YEARS A. According to the Lord's Promise to</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>the Overcomers in Revelation 3:10 That They</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Will Be Kept out of the Hour of Trial</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Which Is about to Come on</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the Whole Inhabited Earth</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>the Rapture of the Overcomers,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both the Man-child in Revelation 12</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and the Firstfruit in Revelation 14,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Must Be before the Sixth Seal, the Supernatural Calamities on the Earth and on the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Revelation 3:10 that the overcomers will be kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth the rapture of the overcomers, both the man-child in Revelation 12 and the firstfruit in Revelation 14, must be before the sixth seal, the supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens Rev 6:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After further study, I believe that it is not reasonable to believe that the Lord would leave His overcomers to pass through the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, according to Joel 2:30-31, there will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets Rev 9:1-11 .</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation 9:4 compared with 7:3 indicates that the fifth trumpet is very close to the sixth seal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first five trumpets are a direct continuation of the sixth seal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the sixth seal is the initiation of the great tribulation and should be considered as a part of "the hour of trial."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The overcomers will be raptured before the sixth seal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. The Initiation of the Great Tribulation,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>as the Supernatural Calamities That Take Place in the Sixth Seal, Occurring Immediately</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>before the Three and a Half Years or Just at the Beginning of the Three and a Half Years</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The initiation of the great tribulation, as the supernatural calamities that take place in the sixth seal, may occur immediately before the three and a half years or just at the beginning of the three and a half years.</S>
