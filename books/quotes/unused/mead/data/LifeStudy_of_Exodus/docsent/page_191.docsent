   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN HOW THE OLD TESTAMENT SEEKERS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENJOYED HIS LAW 2 Scripture Reading: Psalm 119:1, 11, 14-16, 31-32, 34-35, 48, 51-52, 59, 72-73, 87, 95, 99, 102, 106, 111, 127-128, 130, 148, 157, 161-162, 166, 176</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we read Psalm 119 carefully, we shall see that the psalmist considered the law of God as God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Like all the other psalms, this psalm was not written according to doctrine or theology, but according to the deep sentiment and aspiration of the psalmist.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The writer of Psalm 119 uses many different terms to express how he enjoyed God s law as His living word and how he handled it as God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that the psalmist inclined his heart unto it v. 36 , sought it v. 45 , and longed for it v. 20 . In verse 74 he declared, I have hoped in thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To hope in something is to wait for it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the psalmist said that he hoped in God s word, he meant that he was waiting on the word of God and waiting for it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was waiting on God for a word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, he put his trust in God s word v. 42 . When we put all these matters together, we find that they correspond to our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having a heart inclined unto the Word of God, we seek the Word, long for it, and hope in it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we place our trust in the word we have received of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>M. Musing upon It</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a number of verses the psalmist says that he mused upon God s word 15, 23, 48, 78, 99, 148, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In each of these verses the King James Version uses the word meditate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in Psalm 55:17, the King James Version translates the same Hebrew word as pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Hebrew word is also used in Genesis 24:63, where we are told that Isaac went out in the field to meditate, or, as the margin says, to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 143:5 also uses this word: I remember the days of old; I ponder all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for muse, or meditate, implies to bow down, to converse with oneself, and to utter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the Old Testament, to meditate on the Word of God is to enjoy it by musing upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To muse upon the Word is to chew the cud, like a cow eating grass Lev 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we muse upon the Word of God, we should chew the cud.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we take in the Word too quickly, we shall not have very much enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we chew the cud as we take in the Word, our enjoyment will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we muse upon the Word of God, enjoying it and even chewing it as a cow chews the cud, we shall spontaneously pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Prayer is also included in musing upon the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, we may converse with ourselves or begin to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may be so inspired by the Word that we want to shout our praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Usually musing upon the Word will be slower and finer than pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, in our musing upon Exodus 20:2 we may say to ourselves, Remember that Jehovah is your Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now you are out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>O Lord, I worship You for bringing me out of bondage!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In all our musing upon God s Word, talking to the Lord or conversing with ourselves, we should be spontaneous and full of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may bow down to worship the Lord, ponder the Word, remember, or give ourselves a rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All this is included in the practice of musing upon the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Any genuine seeker of the Lord who muses upon the Ten Commandments in a living way will enjoy the Lord, worship Him, pray, converse with himself in the Lord s presence, and also praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Surely one who takes the law of God in such a way will not apply it as dead letters, but will take it as God s living word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To muse upon the Word of God is to enjoy His Word as His breath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to contact God in the Word and to have fellowship with Him, to worship Him, and to pray to Him through and with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By musing upon the Word of God in this way, we shall be infused by God, breathe Him into us, and receive spiritual nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Concerning musing upon the Word, verse 147 says, I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we see that the psalmist rose up before dawn, cried out, and hoped in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 148 goes on to say, Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might muse upon thy word Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The psalmist woke up during the night to muse upon God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Musing upon the Word involves more than just meditating on it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We muse upon the Word by talking to God, worshipping Him, enjoying Him, receiving grace from Him, and conversing with ourselves in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot describe adequately the practice of musing on the Word of God and the enjoyment this affords us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The seekers of God in the Old Testament mused upon His living word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their way of handling the Word of God was different from that followed by many today who mainly exercise their mind to study the Word in letter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the psalmists mused upon the Word of God, they spoke to God, prayed, worshipped Him, and even bowed down to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the presence of God, they spoke to themselves of His mercy, salvation, and gracious supply.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Musing upon the Word in this way is even richer, broader, and more inclusive than pray-reading, for it includes prayer, worship, enjoyment, conversation, bowing down, and even lifting up our hands to receive God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It also includes rejoicing, praising, shouting, and even weeping before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Pilgrim s Progress there is a place where the pilgrim reads the Bible and weeps, shouts, and repents.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This indicates that he not only read the Scriptures, but also mused upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we muse upon the Word of God, we shall delight ourselves in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes we may weep before the Lord or sing hymns of praise to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The psalmist waited for the Lord s word, hoped in it, and arose before dawn to cry out to the Lord that he needed His word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then he mused upon the Word, worshipping the Lord, praying to Him, and receiving His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He also spoke to himself and instructed himself with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All this is part of musing upon the Word of God.</S>
