These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo
They lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation
The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God
We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible
Many think that the church came into being when sinners became Christians thus the church is also regarded as something related to our needs
The church is not an idea or arrangement made by God after the creation of the world, nor does it exist because of man's need
The church exists because of God's deep, eternal, and holy plan according to His deep, eternal, and holy desire
Although He wanted to gain the church to satisfy His heart's desire, He did not tell anyone or any creature about His purpose
Today many people still regard the universe as a mystery, and even many believers do not truly understand the meaning of the universe
He gave Himself up for the church because of His love for the church and for the purpose of producing the church
The Lord went to the cross and gave all He had to purchase this pearl of great value because of His love for the church
From the great price that He paid, we can see how highly the Lord values the church and how much He treasures her
For the past two thousand years, He has been nourishing and cherishing the church, just as a person nourishes and cherishes his own body
Christ not only loves the church as His wife but also nourishes and cherishes her as His own Body, as a part of Himself
Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place
Just as Adam could not find a counterpart from among all the birds beasts and animals Christ could not find a counterpart among all creation
Just as Eve was presented to Adam when he awoke from his sleep, the church was presented to Christ when He resurrected from the dead
The church was produced by Christ being wounded and by Christ releasing His resurrection life through His resurrection from the dead
The Holy Spirit later called all those who believed in the Lord and were saved 'the whole church' in a collective sense
Today the principle is still the same; that is, the reality and practicality of the church depend upon Christ, the cross, and the Spirit
On the surface it appears as if the believers establish the church but actually the Lord is building the church in and through the believers
If the Lord does not move within believers to cause them to build, whatever comes out of their work will not be the church
In the matter of building and establishing the church, man can only 'second' the Lord's motion, agree with the Lord, and follow the Lord
The church is built with those who are saved, but the One who adds those who are being saved to the church is the Lord, not man
Corinthians 12:12-13 speaks of the church as the one Body, and verses 14 through 23 illustrate this in the context of the human body
The church is a living house built with living stones, just as a body is a living organism composed of living members
Just as our body cannot be separated from us, the church as the Body of Christ cannot be separated from Christ
Now the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, but in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory
With respect to us as individuals we are members but we are members one of another with respect to us corporately we are the Body of Christ
As saved ones, we are members of the mysterious Body of Christ who corporately constitute this mysterious Body
The life and nature of Christ are the same as the life and nature of God but are seen from a different perspective
Since the church is the house of God, those in the church are members of the household of God and are the dwelling place of God in spirit
On the one hand, the church is the household of God, and on the other hand, the church is the dwelling place of God
With regard to its usage in relation to the church as the house of God, however, house refers to both a household and a dwelling place
Just as Christ's Body is composed of all those with the life of Christ, God's house is composed of all those with the life of God
They are members of the Body of Christ, members one of another, and brothers in the house of God, brothers one of another
In 1 Timothy 3:15-16 Paul says, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
The church is the great mystery of godliness, an expression of God Himself, manifesting the great mystery of God
She is the enlargement of the manifestation of God in the flesh, the enlargement of the mingling of God and man
The individual Christ involves the mystery of godliness, and the corporate Christ, the church, involves the great mystery of godliness
If the church had only humanity, it would not be the church, and if the church had only divinity, it also would not be the church
The church is the most marvelous thing in the universe because the church contains both the elements of humanity and divinity
The church is God living in man and being mingled with man, moving and living in a way that expresses Himself and accomplishes His purpose
Since the day of Pentecost whenever the church is in a proper condition God is manifested because the church is the mingling of God and man
The church being the Body of Christ not only speaks of her relationship to Christ but also of her function toward Christ
According to God's thought, it was not good for Adam to be alone, and it is not good for Christ to be without the church
With respect to time, the church is the extension of Christ; with respect to space, the church is the enlargement of Christ
Just as the four Gospels show His living in Jesus the Nazarene, the book of Acts shows His living in the church
Just as Acts is the continuation of the Gospels, the church is the continuation of Christ, the fullness of Christ, and the surplus of Christ
Christ conquered sin and death; He conquered the world and the authority of darkness, and the church has inherited these accomplishments
Christ went to the cross, fulfilled God's purpose, and dealt with Satan, and the church inherits these matters on a universal scale
The church is the development of Christ so that all things in the universe would know Christ's fullness and riches
In the Old Testament God used the tabernacle and the temple among the children of Israel to express His glory and to carry out His will
In the New Testament the church is God's dwelling place on earth through which He can express His glory and to carry out His will
As the house of God, the church speaks not only of the church's relationship to God but also of the church's function with respect to God
On the earth today the church is a place for God to make His home, and the church also testifies concerning the things of God
In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church'
The final function of the church is to deal with God's enemies, which include Satan and the authority of Hades
The church will overcome because the church is produced, built up, joined, and mingled with the overcoming Christ
The church on earth today has a great mission to deal with Satan and his authority by relying on the victorious Christ
Once a person believes in the Lord, he is saved; once he receives the Lord as His Savior, he receives the Lord's salvation
Only those who have been saved by the Lord and who want to follow the Lord and to receive His teachings are included in the church
In order to be a member and to participate in Christ, one must be saved, which is to obtain the life of Christ and to be joined to Christ
They can participate in Christianity as a religion, but they cannot participate in the church as the Body of Christ
They appear to be members, but they do not have the life of the church, which is the life of Christ and the life of the Body of Christ
Anyone who does not have a life relationship with God has no part in the church and is not a member of the church as the Body of Christ
Living means that they have been made alive in their spirit; they are not deadened in spirit without the life of God
We speak with people before they get baptized in order to sense whether they have truly been made alive in spirit
Anyone who has touched God inwardly will be alive in spirit; anyone who has simply believed some doctrines will be dead
The divided condition of today's Christianity goes against the Lord's heart's desire and will, and it damages the Lord's plan
The presence of sects in the church is the result of the church deviating from God's plan and losing its initial oneness
How can believers who say I am Baptist I am Lutheran I am Presbyterian and I am Anglican be approved and justified by the one Holy Spirit
There are millions of people here and abroad and throughout the ages who have been saved and who are part of the church
The Holy Spirit lives within the believers, making them one Body, and gives the believers an intrinsic oneness
God wants us to diligently keep the oneness of the Spirit in the Body of Christ by avoiding any sectarian element
Regardless of its source, a special name divides the believers into sects because it separates a group of believers from other believers
Special creeds-The church includes all those who share the common faith that saves us, the one faith spoken of in Ephesians 4:5
Isolated rather than universal fellowship-The Body of Christ is universal, so the fellowship of Christ's Body, the church, is also universal
Separate administration in the same locality-The church in each locality should be one; it should not be divided
Belonging to an organization-The church in any locality must only be a local church; it should not belong to any Christian organization
Once it has an organizational relationship with a Christian organization, it takes on the background of that organization and becomes a sect
Although it is difficult to avoid sects, we must hate the divisions of denominations and be one who is approved by God
The God who is through the church and lives within the church and who is the Father who begets everyone in the church is one
That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ'
When we receive the eternal life that they report, we are brought into their fellowship so that we may have fellowship with them
Since the Holy Spirit makes the believers one Body , the fellowship of the church as the Body is also the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Whoever has this one faith, regardless of his views, beliefs, and opinions on any other point of the truth, participates in this fellowship
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
According to the Bible, the essence of the church is one universally, and the expression of the church is one locally
In the universe the church is essentially one; therefore, in this age the expression of the church should also be one in a locality
In the early days Jerusalem was a very large city with thousands of believers , but there was only one expression of the church in that city
If a church is smaller than a locality by being divided into two or more churches, the church will lose its one expression in that locality
The Bible refers to a church in a believer's house because the church in that locality was small and met in a believer's home
Later, in the Lord's epistle to the church in Ephesus in Revelation, He spoke of only one church there , proving the foregoing fact
The church in the house of Nymphas in Colossians 4:15 was the church in Laodicea mentioned in the second half of verse 16
If there are many believers in one locality, they can be divided into different meetings, but they cannot be divided into different churches
Whoever loses the oneness of the church, the oneness of the church's fellowship, loses the ground of the church
Any ground apart from the oneness of the church and the oneness of her fellowship is not the ground of the church
The divisive, sectarian ground of Roman Catholicism and of many Christian denominations is not the ground of the church
The church is the church; she does not need another name, just as the moon is the moon and does not need another name
These expressions merely describe the location of a church but do not denominate the church by the name of its locality
A name encloses a small number of God's children, separating them from the rest of God's children and forming them into a sect
In addition to the many apostles appointed by God, there are self-proclaimed apostles; but these are false apostles
Although a prophet fulfills his ministry of speaking for God in a local church , he can speak for God as a prophet in any place
Agabus, Judas, and Silas were prophets in the church in Jerusalem, but they also could speak for God when they went to Antioch or Caesarea
Prophets are the greatest gift for the building up of the church because their speaking imparts a spiritual supply
Just as apostles are the highest office for establishing the church, prophets are the greatest gift for the building up of the church
The Bible acknowledges the importance of these offices by saying that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets
The work of the prophets and teachers is directed primarily toward those who are the church for their building up
The work of the evangelists is directed primarily toward unbelievers for their salvation to be brought into the church
Prophets preach the word of God according to revelation, whereas shepherds and teachers preach the revealed word of God
They teach the church according to God's revealed truth so that the believers might be established and built up in the light of God's truth
To build up His church God not only gives gifts to the universal church but also provides different offices for a local church
The universal church emphasizes the aspect of the Body of Christ, and the local churches emphasize the aspect of the house of God
It is altogether under the headship of Christ, and the gifts that are given to the Body come directly from Christ
The focus of the Body of Christ is related to growth, but the focus of the house of God is related to building
Although the house of God is built up by the growth in life of the children of God, it must have some element of administrative arrangement
They are responsible for the administration of a local church, directing and caring for all people and matters related to the church
In administrating, the emphasis is on business affairs; in teaching and shepherding, the emphasis is on the spiritual aspect
In the church there are many matters that require administration, and there are also many believers who need teaching and shepherding
Some elders 'take the lead well' , whereas others are 'apt to teach' and can 'exhort by the healthy teaching and
Since the elders are the administrators of a local church, they must also care for the financial affairs of the local church
Since the elders are the shepherds of the local church, they need to pray over sick believers, anointing them with oil
Since the elders are the representatives of a local church, they lay hands on others together with the apostles
Sometimes they are chosen by the apostles themselves , and sometimes they are appointed by others at the command of the apostles
For the sake of emphasizing their responsibility and to avoid confusion, the apostles confirm this spiritual arrangement
Since elders are appointed by the apostles, brothers and sisters should make an accusation against an elder only to the apostles
The duty of the deacons is to serve a local church, to bear responsibility for the general affairs of a local church
In the local church the elders make decisions and direct people, whereas the deacons carry out matters under the elders' direction
The number of deacons in a local church depends on the number of people in that locality and the volume of its general affairs
For propriety in serving the sisters and caring for them in a thorough way, a local church must have some deaconesses
As this is revealed by the Holy Spirit, the apostles follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to appoint them as deacons
Their appointment, like that of the elders, is according to the will of the Holy Spirit, but it passes through the hands of the apostles
The Holy Spirit reveals the serving ones among the brothers and sisters and then leads the apostles to appoint them as deacons
There is no appointment or termination of service by human election, nor is there a mission board that approves and directs
The administrative arrangement of a local church is completely a matter of the Holy Spirit exercising the authority of the Head
It is arranged neither democratically nor tyrannically, neither according to the opinion of the majority nor the will of an individual
The New Testament clearly shows that local churches are independently administrated and directly responsible to the Head, Christ
There is no such thing as a head church, branch church, superior church, inferior church, or other form of differentiation
No church can control the affairs of another church, nor should any church control the affairs of several other churches
In Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, there were churches throughout the region ; there were no regional boards or general councils
Every local church, regardless of its size, is administrated locally and is managed directly by the Head; it is responsible to Him
All general boards, regional councils, unified councils, and other such organizations in Christianity are against the teaching of the Bible
They also damage the position of Christ as Head in the church and frustrate the Holy Spirit in the exercise of His authority in the church
Although the local churches are administered locally, they have the same life and fellowship because they are the one Body of Christ
A strong and large local church should bear responsibility to help a weaker and smaller local church in spiritual matters
The administration of a church is local and thus independent; the fellowship of the church is the fellowship of the Body and thus is one
He works through the apostles to appoint elders for administration and deacons for service in the local churches that have been established
He raises up shepherds and teachers to shepherd and teach, using the word of God to cultivate and water the saved ones in every locality
In the New Testament service of the church, there is no mediatorial class; all believers are priests, and all can serve God equally
These systems destroy the reality of God receiving service from all the members and are against the teaching of the New Testament
Every member has a function, but each member must be coordinated in the Body for this function to be exercised
All the brothers and sisters, including the elders and deacons, must carry out their functions according to their ministry
There is only the leading of the saints into service so that they would develop in function and serve in coordination
The authority given by the Lord to the church includes determining whether a person's sins have been forgiven or not
The church can determine by the Holy Spirit whether a person's sins have been forgiven and whether he can be received
Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven'
If he will not listen to the church, the church has the authority to deal with him, bind him, and regard him as a Gentile
If a local church is in a proper condition, she has this authority, and the Spirit of the Lord will confirm the church's dealing
The different kinds of authority that the Lord has given the church speak of the importance of the church in the Lord's eyes
The Lord treasures the church and desires to obtain the church; Satan envies the church and desires to damage the church
Not long after the church began, Satan mixed false believers, tares, into the church so that the church became mixed and impure
It caused the churches to turn away from the apostles , which means to leave the teaching and fellowship of the apostles
There were churches who held the teaching of Jezebel, committed adultery, ate idol sacrifices, and knew the deep things of Satan
There were also churches who were lukewarm and self-satisfied to the extent that the Lord was completely shut out
The man-child that the woman brings forth in Revelation 12 is the overcomers whom the Lord gains in the church
The Lord spoke of this matter in the parable of the leaven in Matthew 13 and in the epistle to the church in Thyatira in Revelation 2
The Bible shows that even though there is degradation in the church on earth, the church is also growing unto maturity
No matter how much Satan corrupts the church, God continuously operates to cause the church to grow unto full maturity
We are in the process of being headed up in Him, becoming full-grown and attaining to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
He washes away the old things of Adam from the church and fills her with His element and glory until she is just like Him
The nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it'; 'A river of water of life
The elimination of the element of Adam within the believers and the addition of the element of Christ is the church
The church is separated from the world; when the world is mixed with the church, the church ceases to be the church
The blessing of the church depends on the one accord; the one accord brings in the presence of God and manifests His blessing in the church
Although they were not born of God and do not have the life of God, they were created by Him, and God is their source
The Bible considers all who are from God to be sons of God, regardless of whether they were created by God or are born of God
In God's salvation we are children of God, whereas angels are servants of God and serve us ; therefore, we are greater than the angels
If they did not, they would be unable to carry out their commission from God to do many things in the universe
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation'?
Saints are children in God's household who inherit His salvation; angels are servants in God's household who serve the saints
People may have the thought that angels should be worshipped since they are heavenly, spiritual, and much higher than earthly, fleshy men
He wanted to worship the angel who showed him the visions on the island of Patmos, but the angel said, 'Do not do that!
Although angels are spirits in heaven, who are continually before God's face and who protect and care for us, they are still creatures
Let no one defraud you by judging you unworthy of your prize, in self-chosen lowliness and the worship of the angels'
In Colossians 2 the apostle Paul shows that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ in order to be received by us
Because Christ is the mystery of God the embodiment of God and the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells we should worship Him
For these reasons, how could we, who are one with our Head, Christ, the Lord of all, worship these ministering spirits?
Since we possess Christ and have obtained all the riches of the Godhead in Him, we must not participate in such practices
Every time the Bible mentions Gabriel, he is bringing news to the people of God, and the news he brings is good
They are also called the cherubim of glory ; therefore, they are a group of angels who are especially related to God's glory
In Revelation there is reference to the living creatures, but there is a difference between this and what is spoken of them in Ezekiel
God did not spare the angels who sinned but delivered them to gloomy pits, having cast them down to Tartarus, they being kept for judgment'
Because some of the angels followed the devil to sin and rebel against God, the Bible says that the devil has his angels
Today He gives us the right to enjoy being served by the angels, and in the future He will give us the authority to judge the sinful angels
The devil was a cherub created by God, and he sealed up perfection, was full of wisdom, and was perfect in beauty
God anointed him and set him upon His holy mountain, which is God's dwelling place in heaven, to cover the Ark of God
The devil must have been the highest archangel established by God, and God must have especially relied upon him
He was proud of his beauty, and by means of his brightness, he used his God-given wisdom to sin and commit unrighteousness
The son is not the source, unlike the father, but comes from the father; therefore, this son, who came from God, is an angel created by God
He is operating according to this principle to cause people to sin in the same way that he sinned in the beginning
He causes men to become proud in their thoughts concerning themselves so that they will usurp and deny God's authority
All the murder and hate throughout the history of the human race come from this evil one whose nature is murder
The meaning of this name in the original Greek language is 'accuser,' or 'slanderer,' and it speaks of his character and actions
Sometimes the devil carries out his accusation and slander from within us, and sometimes he uses the people around us
The Bible also calls the devil the ruler of this world because the devil is the leader of the rulers of the world today
The Bible also calls the devil the god of this age because in this age the devil receives worship and service from man
The ruler of this world refers to his control over people; the god of this age refers to the worship that he receives from people
These adjectives describe the condition of the devil, which is the exact opposite of the honorable, holy, and lawful condition of Christ
The devil spoke these tempting words to the Lord in Luke 4:5-6, and they show that his authority in the universe is very great
God must have delivered this authority and glory to him before he fell because only God has the authority in the universe to do this
In the beginning God delivered all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth to him so that he would rule over them for God
The devil became the ruler of these authorities in the air; therefore, his authority is higher than that of the other angels
His kingdom of darkness, his authority of darkness, opposes the kingdom of God, which is also the kingdom of Christ
Against the rulers against the authorities against the worldrulers of this darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies
The devil also has subordinates because he is the ruler of the authorities in the air and the ruler of the world
The first group of subordinates are the angels God originally appointed to be under him to help him rule the earth
Many of these angels followed him in his rebellion against God, and they are now the rulers and authorities in the air
As the devil's subordinates, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies, the world-rulers of this darkness, govern individual nations
The host on high in Isaiah 2421 refers to the devils army in the air because it is contrasted with the kings of the earth in the same verse
Demons, or evil spirits, who are often mentioned in the four Gospels, are another group of the devil's subordinates
The angels who followed the devil became his angels in the air, and the demons, the disembodied spirits, became his servants on earth
In addition to angels in the air and demons on the earth, this group of people serve as his ministers within Christianity
Any worship that is not directed toward God, regardless of the object of its worship, is worship that is directed toward the devil
God can obtain mans worship only when man worships Him in spirit through the Lord Jesus but the devil can obtain mans worship in many ways
The devil used Judaism to confuse the church and to lead the believers astray by bringing them back to Judaism
Shortly after the church came into existence even Jewish synagogues which once were used for the worship of God became synagogues of Satan
Many who were zealous for Judaism and the Old Testament law killed the people of the Lord, thinking that they were being zealous for God
He does not cause people only to deny God; he also causes them to oppose God's will under the guise of serving God
If the devil cannot prevent people from worshipping God, he causes them to engage in self-imposed worship and lowliness
It is a worship that serves God according to worldly philosophy and self-imposed regulations through the efforts of the flesh
Sometimes the devil causes people to kill the apostles and those who work for the Lord in order to destroy the Lord's work
He can also cause people to speak false doctrines and preach a different gospel, another Jesus, so that they will receive a different spirit
According to the record of the Bible, the devil has been involved in six actions in the universe from the beginning to the end
For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil
Once man was poisoned with this devilish thought, he rebelled against God, became corrupted, and fell into the devil's hand
The devil rebelled against God and attempted in vain to become God, but when God came to deal with the devil, He willingly became a man
The Jews who arrested the Lord Jesus and the Romans who crucified Him were all controlled and moved by the devil
The devil killed the Lord Jesus because the Lord constantly stood in the position of a man without denying that He was God
When the devil is thrown out of heaven to earth at the end of this age, he will realize that his time is short
The devil will give his power, throne, and authority to Antichrist and cause Antichrist to willfully do evil on the earth
The appearance of Antichrist will be according to Satan's operation, and Antichrist will do wondrous miracles in order to deceive people
Through Antichrist, the devil will do everything that he can to inflict harm on the saints of God and the people on earth
Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth'
He will cause them to surround and attack God's saints and God's people, but fire will come out of heaven and devour them
There is no person, matter, or thing that cannot be used in order to deceive people, and there is no one who cannot be deceived by him
He can use secular things that are unrelated to serving God to deceive man and he can use religious things involving zealous service for God
The devil does not want the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ to shine in them to bring them out of darkness into the light
It regenerates his spirit and causes him to obtain the life of God and participate in the spiritual things of God
Consequently, the devil comes to snatch away the word of God from man's heart in order to keep him in darkness and death
The devil not only mixes false believers into the church but also mixes heretical teachings as evil leaven into the church
The devil in his brightness often can do more damage to the saints and the church than he can through his roaring and devouring
He points out our mistakes so that we will be embarrassed, and he traps us in difficult situations so that we will be discouraged
When the believers sin and are unwilling to repent, they bring Satan's destruction of their flesh upon themselves
When he hides in eye-catching, pleasant, and clever things, the devil attracts people's attention in order to seduce and deceive them
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Satan was able to hide within Peter's care and good intentions to try to prevent the Lord from accomplishing God's will
Peter did not realize that Satan was hiding within his good intentions; only the Lord could see this matter clearly
It involves falsehood masquerading as truth, wrong things appearing as right, and right things appearing as wrong
We need to be watchful and to pray, asking God to expose the devil's stratagems so that we would not be ignorant of his stratagems
Although the Lord's death fulfilled the legal basis for God's judgment of the devil, this judgment has not been fully executed
After the Lord's crucifixion, the devil can continue to move and work until the Lord completes the execution of God's judgment against him
Through the Lord's judgment on the cross, the devil has no position or power before God to work in or on people
God's judgment against the devil is completed step by step, with each step pushing him lower than the previous one
In the third step he will be thrown into the abyss, and in the fourth step he will be thrown into the lake of fire
Little did he know that God would cast him down step by step until he was in the lowest place, the lake of fire
If we let God's word of life abide in us and accomplish its life-giving effect in us, we will overcome the evil one, the devil
We not only have God's life and word within us to enable us to overcome the devil, but God Himself protects and delivers us from the devil
The Lord prayed for this, and we also should pray that God would protect us and deliver us from the devil, the evil one
The devil often points out our sins and accuses us, but we must rely on the Lord's blood to overcome his accusations
We have studied the topic of the devil, and now we must study the topic of the world because the world is related to the devil
After Satan spoiled and captured man, Satan organized the things on the earth that were for man's existence into an ordered system
Originally, marriage, children, family, food, and other matters of man's living were ordained by God so that he could live for God
Now marriage children family clothing food and other matters have become things of the world to usurp man so that he cannot live for God
Whether or not something is of the world depends on whether it enables us to live for God or hinders us from living for God
To them marriage is something of the earth that is related to their existence; it is not something of the world that usurps them
If we are 'enrolled' in any of his departments, we are under his usurpation, and we are no longer free to live for God or to serve Him
In the Chinese Union Version aion and kosmos are translated without distinction but in the original Greek these words are clearly distinct
Kosmos refers to the entire world, and aion refers to a part of the world, to an age or time period of the world
The age of this world is the current time period in the world, the world as it presently appears before our eyes
It used to be fashionable for people to wear one kind of clothing, but now another kind of clothing is modern and fashionable
Every generation is adulterous, crooked, and perverted because every generation has been seduced and corrupted by the evil one
The words evil, adulterous, crooked, and perverted are vivid descriptions of the corrupt condition of the worldly generations
All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world
These things, however, can be divided into three categories: the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life
The vainglory of life causes people to be proud and to uplift themselves so that they may be able to boast in themselves
If we want to understand and prove the will of God, we cannot be conformed to this age, to the modern things in the world
As the Lord was dying on the cross in His physical body, God judged Satan, the organizer of the world, and the world that lies in him
The Lord's salvation rescued us out of the present evil age; therefore, we should not walk like those in this crooked generation
Through the Holy Spirit He wants to apply what He accomplished on the cross so that we can receive His practical salvation
Although we do not bear responsibility for our salvation, we must bear responsibility to let Him save us in a daily way
The Lord can save us, and He wants to apply His salvation to us, but if we do not let Him, He has no way to do anything
We should let God save us, and we should believe that God will save us from the corruption in the world by lust
In order to live a life that is practically apart from the world we must allow God to save us believe His promises and receive His training
Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world-our faith'
We received God's salvation, and we can cooperate with God, letting Him save us from the world, because we have been begotten of God
If we live by the life of God and believe that this life can save us from the world, we will overcome the world
In order to be practically separated from the world, we must also see how the cross dealt with the world and with us who live in the world
We should know and receive this fact in faith so that we can live a life that is separated from the world and that overcomes the world
If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves'
Everyone who has received the Lord's salvation, dying together with Him, should be one who has left the world and no longer lives in it
Buddhist monks attempt to leave the world by rejecting marriage, children, families, and all matters related to human propagation
We leave the world, but we still marry, have children, families, and all the matters related to the continuation of humanity
We leave the usurping element of these human matters while restoring these things to their proper place in God's plan for human existence
Although we live among human beings, eating and wearing clothing like ordinary people, we are not controlled and usurped by these things
Every fallen descendant of Adam has the tendency to turn to the world, to love fashions, and to gladly follow worldly customs
If we are fashioned according to this age, we will be conformed to the likeness of the world and be permeated and spotted by the world
As those who have presented ourselves as a living sacrifice to God, we should not be fashioned according to this age
Although the world is very lovely and draws people to love it, we must keep ourselves unspotted from it by not loving the present age
In chapter 53 we saw that he is the cherub anointed by God, the highest archangel, who became proud and rebelled against God
The Bible speaks of both sin and sins, with sin referring to indwelling sin and sins referring to outward manifestations of sinful acts
Since indwelling sin relates to man's sinful nature, it is often referred to in the Bible in the singular as sin
When Adam followed Satan to rebel against God, he sold himself to sin and also sold all his descendants to sin
In addition to operating in us, indwelling sin reigns with authority in us, controlling us and causing us to die
Since indwelling sin reigns and exercises authority over us, it also lords over and controls us, making us its slaves
Having been sold to sin as slaves in Adam, sin is our master, and we have no way to escape its control or to free ourselves from it
Because the law of sin operates within us automatically, we do not have to exert any conscious effort to commit sins
Most people do not pay attention to this aspect of indwelling sin, and it is also difficult for people to understand
Consequently, they do not realize that a person who does not commit gross sinful acts is still full of sin and therefore a sinner
It is a peach tree because it has the peach tree nature; it does not need to produce peaches in order to be a peach tree
Similarly, man is sinful and a sinner because he has a sinful nature; he is not a sinner only because he has committed some sinful acts
The phrase all unrighteousness means all things that are unreasonable, illegal, unfair, or not according to proper procedure
If someone does not fulfill his human responsibility of doing good before God, he has committed a sinful act and falls short before God
While those who are bad certainly fall short of God's glory, even those who are good fall short of God's glory
All men, whether moral or immoral, virtuous or evil, good or bad, fall short of the glory of God; therefore, all have sinned
The result of sin relates to the ultimate consequence of sin, whereas the wages of sin relate to the deserving return for sin
The result of the future judgment upon sinners is to be cast into the lake of fire to be punished for eternity
Man is handcuffed to sin, and if he is not freed from sin, it will ultimately bring him into eternal perdition
They cannot be seen in this life, and therefore, some refuse to acknowledge the possibility of their existence
Sooner or later everyone who does not believe will experience every link in this chain because he is handcuffed to sin
As long as a person is chained to sin, he cannot escape from death in this age or from judgment and eternal perdition after death
Christ offered Himself on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins to put away our sins and to deal with our record of sin
We have sin inwardly and sins outwardly; therefore, when the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, He had to deal with both aspects
He resolved the problem of our inward sinful nature, the sin dwelling and reigning within us, which enslaved us
The Lord Jesus did not know sin, but God sent Him in the likeness of the flesh of sin to deal with the problem of sin in the flesh
When Jesus was in the flesh, He had the likeness of the flesh of sin outwardly but not the reality of sin inwardly
When He was judged by God on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin in order to deal with sin in the flesh
On the cross He bore God's judgment for us and dealt with the inward poison of the old serpent, the Devil , that is, the sin in our flesh
He bore our sins and also bore God's righteous judgment on our behalf in order to solve the problem of our outward sins
He solved the problem of our sinful nature by becoming sin for us and by condemning and judging sin in the flesh
Since sin comes from the devil, originates with him, and was passed on to us, it should be sent back to him for him to bear
The goat that was killed and offered to God typifies Christ being killed for us, redeeming us from our sins, and being offered to God
The goat that was killed bore the sins of the children of Israel before God to deal with their sinful record before God
It had to be killed and its blood shed in order to satisfy the requirements of God's righteousness to redeem them from their sins
Since Christ accomplished redemption for us, we should not continue to be companions of the devil, bearing sin
Those who are unwilling to receive Christ's redemption will be the devil's companions and will be forced to help him bear sin for eternity
If there were no sin in the universe, there would be no death, but since there is sin in the universe, there is death
According to the Bible, nothing in the universe other than the resurrection of the Lord Jesus can defeat the victorious might of death
He works out death in everyone through sin, and he exercises the might of death in everyone because of the presence of sin
According to the Bible, there are at least four aspects related to the suffering of death, which speak of the meaning of death
God told Adam that he would die in the day that he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
On the day of his salvation he is enlivened, and God no longer considers such a one as being dead but rather as living again
His spirit died when he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but his body died more than nine hundred years later
Since those in the flames of Hades experience terrible anguish, surely there will be considerable suffering in the lake of fire!
The result of the first death, going to Hades, is temporary and the suffering of its flames less severe than that of the lake of fire
The result of the second death, being cast into the lake of fire, is eternal, and its eternal sufferings are indescribably severe
The Bible shows that the soul and spirit of a dead unbeliever is full of a sense of suffering in the flames of Hades
Believers in Christ have conquered death, even though death is strong, has might, and its sufferings are numerous and terrible
The death of Christ released us from the might of death and enabled us to leave behind the authority of death and to conquer it
Through His death on the cross, Christ destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil, and nullified death itself
We not only leave death behind through His death-destroying death but also overcome death by His incorruptible life
He who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever'
The word which is written will come to pass, 'Death has been swallowed up unto victory''; 'May be swallowed up by life'
God not only works to help us escape from and overcome death; He also works to drive out death from the realm of His authority
When God destroys death, the new heaven and new earth, the realm where God eternally exercises His authority, will be brought in
Only resurrection can resist death; resurrection looses the pangs of death , overcomes death, destroys death, and swallows up death
Without resurrection Christ would not have been raised, and if Christ was not raised, our faith in Him would be futile
Without resurrection we would have no hope, and we would be under the control of death, waiting for the final coming of death
Without resurrection we would have no salvation today and no hope for the future; we would be of all men most miserable
Since Christ rose from the dead and resurrection will come, our salvation today is solid and our future hope is reliable
Through resurrection God deals with and overcomes the death which was injected into His people by His enemy, the devil
If He could not deal with death through resurrection, He could be God only in Himself; He would not be able to come into us
God must resurrect us and eliminate the death in our being through resurrection because He desires to be in us
Just as death includes several aspects in regard to its meaning, there are several aspects of resurrection in regard to its meaning
The first item included in death is the death of the spirit, and the first item included in resurrection is the resurrection of the spirit
When we believed in Christ and received Him, God enlivened our deadened spirit based on the fact that we were raised up together with Christ
When a believer is saved and regenerated, his spirit is resurrected, but the body of a believer will not be resurrected until later
The Bible says that if what we sow does not die, it cannot be made alive, but if it dies, it can be made alive
Next, the saints who belong to Christ and who have died will resurrect when the Lord returns before the millennial kingdom
All those in tombs, whether they are believers or unbelievers, will hear the voice of the Son of God and be resurrected
The first to be resurrected will be the saints who have done good; they will come forth to the resurrection of life
The second will be the unsaved who have practiced evil; they will come forth later to the resurrection of judgment
The resurrected unbelievers will receive judgment, so their resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment
According to the record of the Bible, many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were also raised after His resurrection
In this resurrection only a small number of the dead are raised, which differentiates them from the other dead
When the last trumpet sounds and the Lord returns, the dead saints from all the ages will be resurrected from among the dead
All the saints will be resurrected, but only those who are faithful to the Lord unto death will participate in the out-resurrection
As long as a student passes, he will graduate, but only the top students in the class will graduate with honors
Similarly, every dead believer will be resurrected, but not all will receive a resurrection of reward, the out-resurrection
The resurrection referred to here is the first resurrection because it speaks of the resurrection that occurs before the millennial kingdom
It also says that this resurrection is the first resurrection because the ones resurrected are rewarded to reign with Christ
After they are resurrected, those in the final resurrection will stand before the great white throne to be judged according to their works
The Bible shows that God executes His judgment according to His righteousness, by His holiness, and for His glory
If we clearly see these six aspects with respect to each type of judgment, we will fully understand each of the judgments of God on man
God's judgment of man at the cross of Christ occurred at a place called Golgotha in Hebrew, which means 'skull'
On the one hand, men nailed Christ on the cross to kill Him, but on the other hand, God crushed Christ on the cross and killed Him
Since Christ was our Substitute upon the cross and was struck with God's judgment, God left Him and forsook Him
Since Christ was cursed for us on the cross according to the righteous requirement of Gods law we were redeemed out of the curse of the law
The result of God's judgment of Christ on the cross is that all those who believe into Him are justified by God
After Christ bore God's judgment on the cross, He rose from the dead, ascended, and poured out the Holy Spirit
God's judgment on the cross is one kind of judgment, and His judgment within the church is another kind of judgment
God's judgment in the church is called the judgment of the church because it is carried out through the church on sinning believers
The apostle Paul had to rebuke them for not removing the one who committed the deed of fornication and for not judging him
When the church judges sinning believers, the church judges believers who commit blatant sins and refuse to repent
The apostle spoke of those who are called brothers being fornicators, covetous, idolaters, revilers, or being drunken or rapacious
Any brother or sister who commits any of these sins and who refuses to repent should be judged by the church and removed from the church
The church must judge such a one by removing him in order to avoid corruption inwardly and to care for the church's name outwardly
God gave the church authority to judge a sinning believer because He wants the church to preserve itself in holiness
On the one hand, this prevents other brothers and sisters from being corrupted by the sinning believer and the church from being defiled
On the other hand, it is a punishment and a discipline to the sinning believer that causes him to suffer, be unhappy, repent, and return
It is not an eternal rejection, which results in his perishing, but a temporary punishment and discipline that causes him to repent
Although God wants the church to judge and discipline the believers, there are many problems in the believers that the church cannot touch
Since God's disciplinary judgment of the believers is focused on the believers, the ones being judged are believers
If we discern ourselves first, that is, if we judge ourselves first, we can avoid this disciplinary judgment from God
If we have sinned and do not judge ourselves, God will discipline us by judging us so that we will be corrected by Him to leave our sin
Whatever comes to us through His disciplinary judgment is out of the arrangement and exercise of His good pleasure toward us
Our behavior and actions should match God's righteousness, and we should be harmonious and peaceable toward God and man
When God disciplines us, we must leave these conditions because God causes us to partake of His holy nature and to match His righteous ways
God will also exercise judgment upon believers at the judgment seat of Christ where the actions and work of every believer will be judged
The believers' actions and work will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ when Christ returns at the end of the church age
He will judge us according to our motives and actions so that we will receive praise from God according to our true condition
He will judge our actions and work according to His righteousness after we are saved, and He will reward us according to what we have done
When we were saved, we received the Lord's grace; His gift is likened to a sum of money that has been given to us for doing business
He will require us to give an account of all that we have done since our salvation in order for there to be a full settlement
The Lord will judge us in order to determine if we will be repaid with a reward at the resurrection of the righteous
We who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air'
When the apostle Paul spoke of Christ judging the believer's conduct and work, he used this practice as an analogy
The judgment seat of Christ will be established in the air, so the ones who are manifested are those who have been raptured into the air
These verses refer to the ones who are judged before the judgment seat of God, which is the judgment seat of Christ, as brothers
When we speak against our brothers, we should remember that one day we will stand before the Lord to give an account concerning ourselves
When we criticize our brothers today, we should remember that we will stand before the Lord one day to give an account concerning ourselves
Each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad'
There the Lord will judge us according to what we have practiced, whether good or bad, and He will repay us according to His judgment
Each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad'; 'My reward
Remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire'
Some will be rewarded because their work will remain after passing through the Lord's testing fire of judgment
Salvation or perdition is related to our sins before salvation; reward or punishment is related to our actions and work after salvation
Our sins were dealt with at the cross of Christ, but our actions and work will be dealt with at the judgment seat of Christ
Unbelievers will not be judged at the judgment seat of Christ; only believers will appear before the judgment seat of Christ
The fifth and sixth kind of judgments are related to the nations, the Gentiles, who will be divided into two groups-the living and the dead
In the fifth judgment the living Gentiles will be judged, and in the sixth judgment the dead unbelievers will be judged
When the Lord returns, Jerusalem will become the throne of Jehovah, the throne of Christ, and all the nations will be gathered to it
When the Lord comes to earth and sits on His throne of glory to judge the nations who are living, He will be in the earthly Jerusalem
He will gather all the nations living on earth and separate them, just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats
Even the Gentiles are His flock ; therefore, as their Shepherd, He is the only One with the authority to judge them
Those who come before the Lord's throne of glory to be judged by Him will be all the people living on the earth
Christ will judge the living nations before His throne of glory based upon how they treated the least of His brothers
If they treated the least of the Lord's brothers well, the Lord will call them righteous and consider them sheep
How the people of the earth treat these brothers of the Lord is the basis for the Lord's judgment upon them when He comes to the earth
The righteous will enter eternal life, that is, the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world
All the dead unbelievers from every age will come before the great white throne to be judged to determine their eternal destiny
The judgment at the great white throne will take place after the millennial kingdom and before the new heaven and new earth
There will be one thousand years between this judgment and the judgment that occurs at Christ's throne of glory
The One who will judge the dead at the great white throne will be the One who is spoken of here as 'Him who sat upon it'
Since the believers were judged by God at the cross, they will not be judged again at this time related to eternal condemnation
Those who have no part in the judgment of Christ at the cross must be judged at this time related to eternal condemnation and perdition
The judgment of the dead unbelievers at the great white throne will be based on their actions which God recorded
Since they sinned with the devil when they were alive, they will suffer the punishment of eternal flames with him for eternity
The first four judgments of God are related to believers, whereas the last two are related to the nations and unbelievers
Bosom signifies a place of comfort, so the bosom of Abraham in Hades represents the section in Hades where people find comfort
When a person dies, his spirit and soul leave his body, and he becomes a disembodied soul; that is, he becomes naked
Although we have no answer in ourselves as to where the spirits and souls of the righteous should go, our God is both wise and reasonable
According to His wisdom God opened Paradise, a pleasant section in Hades, so that they might find rest there while waiting for resurrection
In resurrection they will put on a body and be complete, normal, and free from the condition and shame of death
According to Matthew 12:40, He was there for three days and three nights until the time of His resurrection from the dead
Both Acts 2:34 and Philippians 2:10-11 show that the righteous ones in Paradise did not go to heaven following the Lord's resurrection
In the name of Jesus they are still under the earth in the Paradise in Hades, bowing their knees and confessing that Jesus is Lord
After the Lord's ascension on the day of Pentecost, Peter specifically said that David did not ascend into the heavens
Even though Paradise is in the heart of the earth, it is still Paradise because the spirits and souls of the righteous enjoy rest there
According to their view, the spirits and souls of the righteous ones in Hades have been taken captive by the devil and are being held there
Those taken captive refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ's death and resurrection
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
Vanquished foes may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, again indicating Christ's victory over Satan, sin, and death
In Christ's ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for a celebration of Christ's victory
Those who say that the Paradise in Hades was moved to the heavens also regard 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 as a strong basis for their teaching
We have previously seen that being caught away into Paradise and being caught away to the third heaven refer to two different places
These portions speak of being abroad from the body and at home with the Lord and of departing and being with Christ
They then say that since the dead believers leave the earth to go to Paradise to be with the Lord, Paradise must be in the heavens
Although we can live and be with the Lord in our spirit and heart, we are separated from Him at a physical level
If Paradise has been moved to the heavens, the righteous could only descend from the heavens at the time of the resurrection
The city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God'; 'A better country, that is, a heavenly one'
The coming New Jerusalem, which God's dwelling place today will become, is a heavenly city, a city that God has designed and built
According to Revelation 2:7, eating of the tree of life in the Paradise of God will be a reward in the millennial kingdom
Pearls signify the Son's overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, through which entrance to the city is gained
The city is the temple, the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people
There is only one street in the city that spirals downward, reaching the twelve gates of the city on the north, south, east, and west
The Triune God is not only the life of the holy city but also the light and the glory of the holy city as her expression
The New Jerusalem will be an eternal, divine blessing for those joined to the Triune God by believing in Christ
The Greek word in these two verses is the same word that is translated as 'heaven' in Mark 16:19 and Luke 24:51
Neither from the east nor from the west, / And neither from the south, does exaltation come; / For God is the Judge'
When God commanded men on earth to build Jerusalem as a type of His heavenly dwelling, it was on the sides of the north
According to Luke 16 the rich man who died was suffering in this section of torment, burning in a flame and being in terrible anguish
Their eternal fate will be determined; that is, they will be thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone to perish for eternity
After the millennial kingdom, the dead in the section of torment in Hades will be resurrected, and Hades will be emptied
A great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over'
The worshippers of Molech burned their children there, and later the Jews burned the bodies of criminals there as well as unclean things
The Bible uses this picture to describe how sinners will be burned in the lake of fire outside of the New Jerusalem as an eternal punishment
The judgment of Gehenna is the judgment of unquenchable fire; therefore, it is an eternal judgment in the lake of fire
The lake of fire is the final dwelling place for the devil with his angels and for all the sinners and everything that is contrary to God
They will be cast into the lake of fire when the Lord returns to defeat the nations who oppose Him on the earth
The lake of fire was originally prepared for him, and it is fitting that he be thrown into the lake of fire after the millennial kingdom
At the great white throne they will pass through judgment and will be cast into the lake of fire, which will be their permanent prison
Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and makes a lie'
Those who commit sins and are cast into the lake of fire for eternal punishment are like unclean dogs in the eyes of God
The lake of fire signifies eternal punishment for all who oppose God, and the New Jerusalem signifies eternal enjoyment for all God's people
All who choose God and stand with Him will be part of the glorious city as the wife of the Lamb for His eternal enjoyment
All who choose the devil and stand with him will descend into the lake of suffering as the devil's companions in his eternal punishment
According to the Bible, demons must be a group of living creatures who were under the devil's control on the earth in the preadamic age
If God did not spare the angels who sinned but delivered them to gloomy pits having cast them down to Tartarus they being kept for judgment
Tartarus is a very deep pit into which God has cast the angels who sinned, giving them up to the gloom, or to the chains of gloom
God has prepared a place for each category of rebellious, sinful creature, and He jails them each in their own place
The Bible clearly says that when the Lord Jesus returns, He will rapture those who are saved and belong to Him
Throughout the centuries Bible readers and expositors have held differing views concerning the rapture of the believers
He will force people to worship him, and he will do as he pleases on the earth for forty-two months, or three and a half years
The day of the great tribulation will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of the earth as suddenly as a snare
All those dwelling on the face of the earth will fall into the great tribulation, just as birds fall into a snare
Revelation 8:13 speaks of those dwelling on the earth, saying, 'Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth'!
Woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you and has great rage, knowing that he has only a short time'
The woman spoken of in verse 17 is composed of all those who belong to God from both the Old Testament and New Testament ages
Others have the testimony of Jesus; they are the believers who are left on earth at the time of the great tribulation
The preceding verses show that a great tribulation will come upon the earth, such as has never been seen before and will never occur again
These calamities and sufferings speak of the need to be raptured in order to escape the tribulations that will come upon the earth
Luke 21:36 is a promise from the Lord to those who are in need of being raptured to escape the tribulations that will come upon the earth
It is not enough to be saved; we must be watchful at all times and beseech constantly in order to obtain the Lord's promise
Those who are merely saved cannot be counted worthy of this blessing; only those who are saved and who overcome are worthy
To escape the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole inhabited earth is to escape the coming great tribulation
The great tribulation will try those who dwell on the earth they will pass through this time of great tribulation and be tested tremendously
These verses speak of facts related to the rapture of the believers and prove that some believers will be raptured and others will be left
We should not regard the first man and first woman as believers, and the second man and second woman as unbelievers
Also, according to verse 42, the Son of Man is described as being the Lord of the men in the field and the women at the mill
When the Lord returns, the believers who are watching will be raptured, and the believers who are not watching will be left
She brought forth a son a manchild who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod and her child was caught up to God and to His throne
The man-child brought forth by the woman will be the strong ones from among God's people throughout all the ages
How can you say that all believers must pass through the great tribulation and be raptured at one time after the tribulation'?
These verses are difficult for people like him because they clearly show that a group of believers will be raptured before the tribulation
The teaching that all believers will pass through the tribulation and be raptured together at the end of the tribulation is too strained
The firstfruits were growing in the world, but now they are on Mount Zion in the heavens because they are ripe
Revelation 14:9 shows that after the firstfruits are raptured to the heavens, Antichrist is still able to work on earth
Verse 12 shows there are still believers on earth who keep the Lord's word after the rapture of the firstfruits
If overcoming believers are not raptured before the great tribulation, how could they be kept from the hour of trial?
As the firstfruits, the overcomers will be with Christ on Mount Zion, which is the heavenly Zion , not the earthly Mount Zion
The overcoming believers will be raptured to the third heaven, whereas the majority of the believers will be raptured to the air
One requirement for being raptured before the tribulation and escaping the great tribulation is to be watchful at every time, beseeching
In order to beseech the Lord in this way, there should not be anything between us and the Lord, nor should we be loose in any way
We must not say or do anything lightly, and all of our intentions and actions must be searched and restricted by the Lord
Only such persons will be considered worthy of escaping the coming tribulation and being raptured to stand before the Lord
If we want to enjoy the pretribulation rapture, we must not only watch and beseech; we must also watch and be ready for the Lord's coming
We must be ready to be raptured, to be taken away by the Lord at His coming, and to go forth and meet the Lord
Only those who are ready and waiting for the Lord can be raptured by the Lord before the coming of the great tribulation
A believer who is watchful and ready, waiting for the Lord, must be one who loves the Lord and who loves His appearing
Keeping the word of the Lord's endurance will keep us out of the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole inhabited earth
Keeping the word of the Lord's endurance is a requirement related to being raptured to escape the great tribulation
Whether we are a full-time servant of the Lord or serve the Lord in a job, it is not easy to keep the Lord's word in everything
If we would escape the tribulation that will come on the earth, we must endure the difficulties that this world imposes on us today
The believers are God's crop on the earth that has grown out of the seed that the Lord sowed while He was on the earth
Since that time His harvest has been growing and it will continue to grow until it is reaped when the majority of the believers are raptured
From this cloud, the Lord will thrust His sickle upon the earth; that is, He will send His angels to the earth
With the exception of a small number of overcoming believers the rest of the believers both dead and living will participate in this rapture
Most of the believers will be raptured at the last trumpet, which is the trumpet of God spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 4:16
Most of the believers will be raptured at the sounding of the last trumpet, which occurs at the end of the great tribulation
These portions clearly prove that the majority of the believers will not be raptured until the end of the great tribulation
According to the Bible, the majority of the believers will be raptured after the great tribulation, not before it
Antichrist will oppose the Lord during the last three and a half years before Christ's return, which is the great tribulation
Most of the believers will be left on earth to pass through the great tribulation before being raptured at its end
The believers are God's crop on the earth, and the rapture of the majority of the believers is the reaping of God's crop
By passing through the trials of the great tribulation, they will thoroughly ripen and meet the requirement for being raptured
If we do not love the Lord today and give ourselves to Him, we will love the Lord and give ourselves to Him later
If we do not deal with certain matters and give up the world today, we will deal with them and give up the world later
We should never think that the Lord will rapture us to His enjoyable presence even if we do not pursue Him or grow and ripen
They will force us to reject the earthly water and be weaned from the world so that we can take Him as our everything
Only then will He thrust His sickle down to the earth, that is, send His angels to the earth to reap, or rapture, us
We have spoken of two kinds of believers being raptured, but this does not mean that there are only two times of rapture
Thank the Lord, we have studied fifty-nine topics, and now we have come to the last topic: the second coming of Christ
The angels promised the disciples that the Lord would come in the same way that they beheld Him going into heaven
We will be like Him in every part of our being from our spirit to our body, and we will be manifested with Him in glory
The dead believers will be transfigured through resurrection, and the living believers will be transfigured through rapture
Both the resurrection of the dead believers and the rapture of the living believers will occur at the time of the Lord's second coming
At that time the Lord will exercise vengeance according to His righteousness on all who persecuted His believers
According to Revelation 19:8-9, the wife in verse 7, the bride of Christ, consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium
In contrast, the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity
All Israel will be saved, as it is written, 'The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob''
When the Lord returns, He will be the Deliverer of the Jews, the house of Jacob, and He will turn away their ungodliness
And the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley
The problems of the world are like a pile of tangled string that great men of every age have been unable to unravel
According to the present world situation, the Lord Jesus must return in order for the world's problems to be resolved
The Lord will attack them so that their flesh will shrivel, their eyes will dry in their sockets, and their tongues will rot
The leaders of these rebellious nations, Antichrist and the false prophet, will be captured and cast alive into the lake of fire
When the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory
He will sit on the throne of His glory, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered before Him to be judged
The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever'
After the Lord returns and clears up the problems on earth He will establish His kingdom on the earth and the earth will become His kingdom
The Lord will be the King over all the earth and will exercise righteousness so that the earth will be peaceful and blessed
The Lord's return is needed in order to deal with the powers of evil on earth, to cast out the devil, and to punish the evil
The problems afflicting the believers, the Jews, and the nations will be resolved only with the Lord's second coming
The Greek word translated 'revelation' here is apokalupsis, and it literally means 'unveiling,' or 'revelation'
The Lord's parousia will start when the Lord raptures the overcomers to heaven to be with Him before the beginning of the great tribulation
Beginning at this time, the Lord's parousia, that is, His coming, will last for three and a half years until His appearance is manifested
If we see that the Lord's second coming is a parousia, that is, a coming over a period of time, these questions will be answered
At the end of the great tribulation, the coming of His presence will be manifested when He comes to earth to appear to men
In order to understand the Lord's second coming, we must understand and remember these fine details, or we will not be clear
One aspect of the Lord's second coming involves a coming that is hidden and secret, like the coming of a thief in the night
Just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be
At this time the Lord will come and secretly rapture the overcoming believers to His presence, just as a thief steals precious things
Concerning that day and hour, no one knows'; 'Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes'
The open aspect of the Lord's second coming will be at the end of the great tribulation, but Antichrist will be manifested before that day
According to Revelation 13:5, this will occur at the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation
The time of the hidden aspect of the Lord's coming cannot be determined, because there is no basis on which to make such a determination
The time of packing and preparing our luggage is hidden, but the time of boarding an airplane is open for all to see
The overcoming believers will be raptured at the time of the Lord's hidden coming; they will participate in His parousia
The remainder of the believers will be raptured prior to the Lord's open, manifested coming; they will participate in His epiphaneia
Before the Lord descends to the clouds in the air, He will rapture the overcomers to God's throne in the heavens
When the Lord descends from the heavens to the clouds in the air, the overcoming believers will descend with Him
His descent from the clouds in the air to the surface of the earth is His epiphaneia, the manifestation of His parousia
When we see these signs, the Lord's second coming will be near, and we should be watchful and ready, waiting for Him to come
Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places
Nation fighting against nation denotes civil war, and kingdom fighting against kingdom denotes international war
The appearance of these disasters on the earth are signs that the day of the Lord's second coming is drawing near
Today there are people who teach and without natural promote disobedience to parents and being unthankful, unholy, affection, and implacable
People today do not want to be restricted; they all do things recklessly and arrogantly under the guise of freedom
These are all signs of the Lord's second coming, and they should remind us that we must watch and be prepared for the Lord to come
When speaking of the condition of the people in the days of Lot, the condition of buying, selling, planting, and building are added
According to the Lord, the condition of the people in the day of His return will be the same as it was in the days of Noah and Lot
In the last of days mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own lusts and saying, Where is the promise of His coming'?
Learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near
The Lord's word concerning the fig tree branch becoming tender and putting forth its leaves refers to this matter
When Israel, like the fig tree, becomes tender and puts forth leaves, the Lord said that His coming would be near
Before the day of the Lord's second coming, the apostasy will come, and the man of lawlessness, Antichrist, will be revealed
When you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place '
Antichrist will set up an abominable idol of desolation, an image of himself , in the temple and make people worship it
When the great tribulation, the last three and a half years, is about to begin, Antichrist will set up his image in the temple
When the Lord's coming is very near, there will be extraordinary changes to the situation in the heavens and on earth
If our hope is on something other than the Lord, we will have a problem with Him, and we will be a defeated believer
We must forsake everything that is filthy and remove all mixture if we want to be worthy of waiting for the Lord's coming
