   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ALTAR AND THE SACRIFICES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE WORSHIP OF GOD INDICATING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THAT FALLEN MAN NEEDS TO BE REDEEMED,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TERMINATED, AND REPLACED BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WITH HIS CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 20:24-26, the altar and sacrifices for the worship of God indicate that in order to worship God fallen man must be redeemed, terminated, and replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God requires man to worship Him through an altar and with a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, the one who worships God must lay his hand on the head of the sacrifice and thereby identify himself with it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sacrifice is then slain and placed on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All this indicates that fallen man needs to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced by Christ with His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are redeemed and terminated by the altar, but we are replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before we can appreciate these matters, we need to realize that we are sinners and that our case is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we were not sinners, there would have been no need for God to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we were not hopeless, God would not require that we be terminated and replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that we need redemption, termination, and replacement indicates that we are sinful and hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is wrong for a brother to expect his wife to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, recognizing that her case is hopeless, he should see that her need is not improvement but termination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are all a hopeless case, and the case of our husband or wife is likewise hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we should accept the fact that we need to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But after we are terminated by the cross, we enter into resurrection, and in resurrection we can be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A brother needs to see that his wife cannot improve, but she can be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, a sister should not pray that the Lord will improve her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of prayer is merely ethical and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, she should pray, Lord, I thank You that You are able to replace my husband with Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I ask You, Lord, to replace him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The altar and the sacrifices imply redemption, termination, and replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, as we have indicated, the need for redemption indicates that we are sinful, and the need for termination indicates that we are a hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever I read of the altar and the sacrifices, I see Christ, my replacement, with His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now I can say, Praise the Lord that even though I am sinful, I have been redeemed, and even though I am hopeless, I can be terminated and replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord, I thank You that the process of being replaced by You is still going on, and one day it will be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The time is coming when I shall be fully replaced by You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE FREEDOM OF A SLAVE IN A SABBATICAL YEAR</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>SIGNIFYING THAT FALLEN MAN UNDER BONDAGE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>MAY BE FREED BY GOD S REST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The freeing of a slave in a sabbatical year signifies that fallen man under bondage may be freed by God s rest 21:2 , which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know from Genesis that, after laboring for six days, God rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the Sabbath denotes God s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the seventh year, a sabbatical year, a slave would be set free.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What good news this was for a slave!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A slave knew that after serving six years, in the seventh he would be set free.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By God s rest, he would be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the ordinance dealing with the freeing of slaves in a sabbatical year, we see the good news of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fallen people are slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Romans 7:14 Paul describes himself as sold under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every sinner has sold himself under slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not think that you have been enslaved by others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No, you have enslaved yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have sold yourself into slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the gospel declares the good news that when Christ, God s rest, appears to us, our slavery is ended, and we are set free.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indeed is good news!</S>
