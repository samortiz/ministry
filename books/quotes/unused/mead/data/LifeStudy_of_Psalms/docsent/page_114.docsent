   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The New Testament charges us to believe into Christ, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many will not translate this Greek word as into, because they say that this is not good English.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They maintain that into should be translated as in. In other words, we are to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word in, however, should actually be translated as into.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not merely believe in Christ; we believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To believe into Christ is to receive Him and be united with Him as one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word into conveys this divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The writer of a book entitled Bone of His Bone quotes Jessie Penn-Lewis as saying that the Greek text of John 3:16 conveys a different meaning from our English versions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not he who believes in Christ but he who believes into Him who shall have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the author goes on to say that the Christian life is not an imitation of Christ but a participation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To believe into Christ is to be united with Christ as one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that in speaking of the divine things in God's economy, we should not be bound by language.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Language should be managed by us to serve our purpose in the culture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Testament says that we should believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Noah and his family could not have been saved if they had merely relied upon the ark outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They had to enter into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a picture of our believing into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were once outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were born in Adam, but we were outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We needed to take a step to get into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first step was our believing into Christ, and the following step was our being baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through our believing and being baptized, we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This brief fellowship should help us to see the standard of God's New Testament economy in comparison with the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in Psalms 25 41.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While the psalmist was enjoying God in God's house, he expressed his sentiment, and his expressions were a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this message we want to see these mixed expressions in Psalms 28 30.</S>
