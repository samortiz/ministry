   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Please remember that in the course of giving your testimony, you may be affected by personal problems.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But you cannot avoid dealing with these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You still must deal with the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You can have a testimony before men only after you have dealt with your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some have committed murder in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What should they do now?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a part of their past.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible there are two murderers who were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One was involved directly with the act of murder, while the other murdered indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first one was the robber on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is clear in the Greek language that the word robber does not just mean an ordinary robber; it means a criminal who engages in such acts as murder and arson.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was not just a thief but one who robbed and killed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After he believed in the Lord, his sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible does not tell us how he terminated his past.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The other person is Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was not involved in any direct murder.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, he was an accomplice in the murder of Stephen, and he watched over the garments of those who killed Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After Paul was saved, nothing was said about how he dealt with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In principle I believe that once a murderer has believed in the Lord, his sins are behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no sin which cannot be cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The robber did not have to do anything to terminate his past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In fact, he had no opportunity to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord said to him, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, when we encounter such cases, we should not overly burden the conscience of others, unless of course God has first worked in that person's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is because in the two New Testament cases that deal with murder one directly and the other indirectly God did not pay attention to the rectification of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, I believe that some have no peace in their conscience, not because they are suffering from ordinary accusations, but because God is working in them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In such cases, we should not stop them from expressing their regrets to the victim's family.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>D. The Termination of Unsettled Matters</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a person is saved, he surely has many unsettled secular matters at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These may easily hinder him from following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead" Matt 8:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is another biblical case of terminating the past.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here, a man came to Jesus and said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father" v. 21 . The Lord said, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." The word their refers to the first use of the word dead, whereas the second dead refers to the man's father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first dead refers to those who are spiritually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In God's eyes those in the world are spiritually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord was saying that the man should let the dead bury his father, while he should follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not exhorting new believers to not make funeral arrangements for their fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am saying that the dead should bury their own dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must lay hold of this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should let go of unfinished business.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we wait until we have finished settling them before we become Christians, we will never have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are hundreds and thousands of items of unfinished business in our families, with our fathers, and in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who then could become a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is only one word to describe the principle behind all of these things these are dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let the dead bury their dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let the spiritually dead handle the matters of the dead!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not to exhort new believers to neglect their family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It means that they should not wait until they have settled all their earthly matters before coming to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If they do, they will not be able to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people want to settle all of their affairs before they believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If so, they will have no opportunity to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not be bound by matters of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead, we should just regard the unsettled matters as settled.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we want to settle them before following the Lord, we will never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Matters concerning idols, improper things, and debts must be dealt with thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As for other unsettled matters, we should just let them go!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>With regard to the attitude of a new believer towards his past, I can only find the above four categories of things in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As for many other unsettled affairs, we should regard them as settled.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As to family duties, we should let the dead take care of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have no time to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We want to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those things are not for us to settle; they are for the dead to take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let the ones who are spiritually dead handle them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A QUESTION</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A brother asked: If I have offended a person and he is not aware of it, must I also confess to him?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Answer: It all depends on whether or not he has suffered material loss.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the other party is aware of this loss, you should deal with the matter by following Zaccheus's example.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even if he is unaware of this loss, you should still confess to him, especially when material loss is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is best to bring the matter to the church and let the more experienced brothers help you solve it because they know what is most expedient.</S>
