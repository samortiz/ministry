Christ would not wish to return until He could say of these overcoming ones, &#8220;They overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.&#8221; (See Rev. 12:11.)<p>Notice the promises to the overcomers, in the second and third chapters of The Revelation. They mean something.<p>Dogmatic assertion ill becomes a Christian who is looking for the Coming of Christ; therefore the teacher should not insist upon the acceptance of any particular view as to those who are translated in the First Rapture. Possibly a more careful study of the Oriental harvest time and the various offerings connected therewith, would revolutionize many theories that are advanced at the present time.<p>The main question to be considered is individual preparedness and a walk with God like Enoch of old. The Christian should remember that the Life of the God-Man is for each member of His Body, moment by moment.<p>Simply and continuously should the Christian live out the &#8220;Life of the Man in the Glory.&#8221; It is not a hard, strained life; rather it is the normal life of a Christian. We are the channels through which His Life flows to others, refreshing us meanwhile.<p>It is a blessed life, because we realize our need and utter dependence; consequently we are kept from self-energy and self-esteem.<p>Every moment of every day, we may draw from His fullness for all our needs.<p>Continually may we sing:<p class=hbody>There&#8217;s a Man in the Glory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose Life is for me.<br>He&#8217;s pure and He&#8217;s holy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphant and free.<br>He&#8217;s wise and He&#8217;s loving,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender is He;<br>And His Life in the Glory,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life must be.</p><p class=hbody>There&#8217;s a Man in the Glory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose Life is for me.<br>He overcame Satan;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From bondage He&#8217;s free.<br>In Life He is reigning;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kingly is He;<br>And His Life in the Glory,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life must be.</p><p class=hbody>There&#8217;s a Man in the Glory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose Life is for me.<br>In Him is no sickness;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No weakness has He.<br>He&#8217;s strong and in vigor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buoyant is He;<br>And His Life in the Glory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life may be.</p><p class=hbody>There&#8217;s a Man in the Glory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose Life is for me.<br>His peace is abiding;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient is He.<br>He&#8217;s joyful and radiant,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expecting to see<br>His Life in the Glory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived out in me.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
