        <h2 class="head3">Needing to Receive the Life of God</h2>
<p>Adam possessed the image and likeness of God outwardly; however, he did not have the life and nature of God inwardly. Therefore, after God created Adam, He put him before the tree of life with the intention that Adam would receive the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9), which signifies the life of God. If Adam had received the tree of life, he would have had not only the likeness of God outwardly but also the life and nature of God inwardly and thus be completely like God.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Adam fell before he received the life signified by the tree of life. As a result, he could not receive God in order to express God inwardly and outwardly. It was not until Christ came to the earth to die for man&rsquo;s redemption that the life of God was again made available to man. When Christ died and resurrected from the dead, He released the divine life for man to receive. When we believe into Christ and receive Him, His life enters into us. Furthermore, from that time onward the life of God continues to work in us until it makes us exactly the same as He is. For this reason, Romans 8:29 says, &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; As believers, we were foreknown and predestinated by God; hence, His life will work in us until we are conformed to the image of His Son to become exactly the same as He is.</p>
<p>We need to understand that as created men, we had only the image of Christ outwardly, not the life and nature of Christ inwardly. When we were saved, Christ&rsquo;s life and nature entered into us. From that time, God has been working to conform us through His Spirit and our outward environment to the image of Christ; He will continue to work until we are the same as His Son in life and in nature, that is, until we are the same as He is and become His expression. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we &ldquo;are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This continual work of the Spirit of God to transform us into the image of the Lord also refers to the conforming work of God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:29 and 2 Corinthians 3:18 stress our inward change. Philippians 3:21 says, &ldquo;[He] will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.&rdquo; This means that in the future our body will be transfigured so that our outward physical form will also enter into glory. At that time, when &ldquo;He is manifested, we will be like Him&rdquo; (1 John 3:2).</p>
<p>Our possessing the image of God is revealed in Revelation as well. On the one hand, God is sitting on the throne and has the appearance of jasper (4:2-3); on the other hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of the redeemed ones, also has the appearance of jasper (21:11). God and the New Jerusalem are jasper; they are exactly the same. Just as God is, so are His redeemed ones. At this point God will have made His redeemed ones exactly the same as He is.</p>
<p>The verses above show that the line of image runs through the entire Bible. The line reveals that God desires to gain man so that man would have His image for His expression. This is God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ruling for God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in His creation of man is that man would express Him and that man would have authority to rule for Him and thus deal with His enemy. Genesis 1:26-28 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth. And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&rdquo; This portion concerns the image of God and the dominion of God. Dominion is a matter of authority. God created man in His image and gave man authority to rule over all living creatures. God&rsquo;s image in man was created by God, but God&rsquo;s authority in man was given by God. Image speaks of man&rsquo;s being, but authority speaks of man&rsquo;s doing. On the one hand, man is in the image of God; on the other hand, man rules for God. Hence, the image refers to man&rsquo;s status, and ruling refers to man&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Every person has a status and a work. For example, if a person has the status of a student, his work is to study. If a person has the status of a teacher, his work is to teach. If a person has the status of a businessman, his work is to conduct business. The status of a student refers to his person, and studying refers to his work. The status of a teacher refers to his person, and teaching refers to his work. The status of a businessman refers to his person, and conducting business refers to his work. Every person has a work. Created man is no different. Man&rsquo;s person is in the image of God, and his work is to rule for God. God gave created man the high status of His image and the great work of ruling for Him. Regrettably, man&rsquo;s person and work today are not up to the standard. Our person is not right, and our work is not right. In His salvation, however, God desires to save us to the extent that we have His image and that we rule for Him.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
