   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Taste Remaining, Scent Not Changing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here are some sobering words: "His taste remains in him, /And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because Moab was not emptied from vat to vat, from pot to pot, and from vessel to vessel, and because he was never disciplined and dealt with by God, his taste remained in him and his scent never changed!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers, this is why God has to work on you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He wants to take away your taste and change your scent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God does not want your own taste and scent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I once said that many people are "raw" because they are still in their original state.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They have never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You had a certain kind of taste before you believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today you may have been a believer for ten years, yet your taste is still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your scent remains the same as it was before you believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word scent in Hebrew means "smell," which is the flavor of something in its original state.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You had a certain smell before you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today you have the same smell; there is no change in you at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, you have not experienced any of God's constitution and carving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's discipline is indeed precious!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He wants to uproot us and to empty us from vessel to vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God disciplines us and deals with us in many ways so that we may lose our original smell and yield the peaceable fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The peaceable fruit of righteousness can be translated as "the peaceable fruit, which is the fruit of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>D. The Peaceable Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being the Fruit of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please remember that the fruit is peaceable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A man must be at peace with God in order to obtain this fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The worst thing one can do is to murmur, to lose his peace, and to rebel during times of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One can be grieved by the discipline, but he should not murmur or rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem with many people is that they have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why we need the peaceable fruit when we are under discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want the peaceable fruit, you must first learn to accept the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must learn not to fight with God or argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The peaceable fruit is the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once you have the fruit of peace, you have the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why the apostle said, "The peaceable fruit, which is the fruit of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peace is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the inward fruit is peace, the outward expression is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have the fruit of peace within, you will spontaneously partake of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope that none of us would be like Moab, who was at ease from his youth and who had settled on his lees.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had not been emptied from vessel to vessel and had never gone into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, his taste remained in him and his scent was not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some have been Christians for ten or twenty years and have remained the same throughout this time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They have not accepted any of God's dealings and have not subjected themselves to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, their taste remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If our scent remains the same for ten or twenty years, it means that we have never yielded any peaceable fruit before God and have never been constituted with a holy character.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our hope is that God would constitute us with something, something called a holy character.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hebrews 12:12-13 says, "Therefore set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees, and make straight paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather may be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes it seems that discipline makes the hands hang down and the knees paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the apostle told us not to be disheartened.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The hands may hang down and the knees may be paralyzed, but there is the fruit of peace and the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A. Setting Straight the Hands and the Knees</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not think that after a person suffers much hardship and discipline, there is nothing more to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we are disciplined and scourged, we need to set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Discipline and scourging will yield the fruit of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This fruit of peace is the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a person is at peace with God, he will have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As soon as we calm ourselves down and submit to God, everything becomes right and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As soon as we humble ourselves, we become constituted with a holy character.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fruit of peace is the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not set your eyes on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Just consider whether or not you are at peace, and whether or not you are obedient and pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you are pliable and obedient, and if you are at peace, you will surely be constituted with holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please bear in mind that even though you may have endured many trials and experienced many hardships in the past, there is still the need for you to set straight your hands which hang down and your paralyzed knees.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>B. Making Straight the Paths</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the same time, you need to "make straight paths for your feet."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today we can say that we have somewhat passed through this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are presenting this way clearly before you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"That what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather may be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who are falling behind do not need to be put out of joint any longer; they can be healed and join the others who have passed the same straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a person goes through trials and humbles himself under God's mighty hand, he will find his character constituted with holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He will also lead many to this straight course; they will no longer be put out of joint but will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a brother is before us and he veers off, his deviation may discourage others from finding the right course.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why we must be obedient ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must bear the fruit of peace ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This will not only ensure that we are on the right course, but also will open up the right course for others to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the lame ones can take this way; they can all be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I recall the lame man in Acts 3.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When his feet were made strong and he began to walk, he stood up, walked, leaped, and praised God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A lame man was healed, but there are many lame ones in this world today.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They can all be healed by the straight course we take.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must open a way for all the brothers to follow.</S>
