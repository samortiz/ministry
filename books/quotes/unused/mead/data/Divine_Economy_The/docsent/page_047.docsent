   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEM OF SPEAKING IN TONGUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the early 1900s Pentecostalism came to the United States and spread to the West Coast where a conference was held on Azusa Street in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then two schools of doctrine came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One was mild, saying that if you do not speak in tongues, you do not have the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The stronger school, however, said that without this baptism with the speaking in tongues you could not be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These Pentecostals became divided.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. B. Simpson was among the leaders there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because he could not agree with these teachings, he departed and formed the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many among the remainder of the milder ones went on to form the Assembly of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that time onward in the United States, many Pentecostals believe that if you do not speak in tongues, you have not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To some this also means that you have not been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I have the full assurance that I was regenerated in 1925, even though I had not spoken in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, many saints who never spoke in tongues have also been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>D. L. Moody, C. H. Spurgeon, and John Nelson Darby never spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Martin Luther did not speak in tongues either.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these great men, although they did not speak in tongues, were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hudson Taylor, the founder of China Inland Mission, also did not speak in tongues, yet you cannot say that he was not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many great speakers of the Keswick conventions never spoke in tongues, yet we could not say that they were not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no verse in the Bible which says that if I have not been baptized in the Spirit and have never spoken in tongues, I am not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1936, we thought there might be something in the Pentecostal movement of the Lord and felt we should not be narrow but should remain open to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We went to their meetings and spent some time to watch them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more I observed them, the more I doubted whether they spoke in genuine tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word for tongue in Acts 2:4 is glossa, whereas the Greek word for dialect, dialektos, is used in verses 6 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Acts chapter two these two words are interchangeably used.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the tongue spoken must be a dialect, an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, as I observed those who spoke in tongues, they all spoke in sounds which could not be a dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A dialect cannot consist of as few sounds as were uttered by these tongue-speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I questioned an American leader of this movement, using an Interlinear Greek Bible, he could not give me an adequate answer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This disappointed me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was a top leader in the Pentecostal movement in China and knew Greek, but he could not explain how this kind of speaking could be a dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a Pentecostal meeting one may speak in tongues using only four syllables in his utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another may interpret for him saying, "My people, time is short.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Be zealous, love one another, and preach the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the next day they all will come together, and the same one will speak in tongues again, using the identical utterance from the previous night.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, on this night, another may interpret for him, saying, "My people, the church here needs a big hall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All you who have money should donate it to build the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord will bless you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the third day the brother may speak in tongues again in the same way, and another will interpret in yet a third different way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A linguist could tell you that this simple utterance of four syllables was the same on each of the three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet there were three very different interpretations for it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that this kind of speaking in tongues is not genuine, but altogether a human manufactured utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no real dialect consisting of only four or five syllables.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a speaking as practiced in Pentecostal meetings is only a sound made with the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Japanese speak in tongues in this way, they do it with a Japanese accent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Chinese speak in tongues in this way, they do so with a Chinese accent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, the Mexicans speak in tongues with a Mexican accent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am not against the genuine speaking in tongues as mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is the speaking in tongues in the Bible, but it is not as the tongue-speaking practiced today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The tongues in the Bible are surely a dialect, which is altogether understandable and meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this matter we should come back to the pure Word because there is such an influence today that disturbs God's seeking people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>TAKING THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>BY LIVING FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must take the baptism in the Holy Spirit by living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are right with the Body of Christ, we are in a position to take the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should realize that it has already been accomplished and now exists upon the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As members of the Body of Christ maintaining a right relationship with the Body, we are entitled to claim it through the exercise of living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must take it just as we took the value of the Lord's redeeming death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We did not take that according to our feeling or any kind of so-called manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We received the Lord's redemption simply by believing, and the Lord honored it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we believe in the accomplished fact of the Lord's death for our sins, the Holy Spirit quietly honors our faith; forgiveness of sins and divine life are imparted to us, and we have peace and joy within.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We just believe what the Lord has accomplished according to what we are told in the Will the New Testament .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Will also tells us that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is accomplished upon the Body of Christ and waiting to be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We who are rightly related with the Body of Christ should simply take it by living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we mean business with the Lord, He will honor our faith, and we will experience it.</S>
