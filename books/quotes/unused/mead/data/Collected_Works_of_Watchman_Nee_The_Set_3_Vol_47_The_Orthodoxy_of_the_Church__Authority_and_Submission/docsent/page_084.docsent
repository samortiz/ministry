   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE A MISTAKE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Self-motivated service cannot find acceptance in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, no one can render any service at all by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man must serve by standing on the ground of resurrection before his service can be approved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord does not want us to be misguided to assume that authority comes from someone other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not the authority; we are only here to represent authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The flesh has no place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must also tell others that everything wrong comes from us and everything right comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time we talk to men or deal with matters, we have to remember that we cannot trust in ourselves and that we have to understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot go out on our own and make suggestions or decisions lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Authority does not rest with us; we are merely the deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we act according to our own will, we will create big problems.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church cannot be without authority, and the church cannot tolerate the misuse of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has only one mind, which is to build up His own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church submission to authority is absolute, and fear and trembling on the part of the deputy authority should also be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without submission there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, a deputy authority must not make suggestions or decisions loosely, and he must not speak carelessly or dictate others' pathways.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is wrong to judge the brothers or to interpret the Bible lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our submission must be absolute, and our representation of authority must also be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are two problems in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One is the lack of absolute submission, and the other is the misrepresentation of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must learn not to speak loosely or make proposals casually.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our spirit has to be open to the Lord all the time, and we have to look to His light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not, we will implicate God in our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may even say that we are acting in the Lord's name or on His behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, none of our actions are of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must learn to submit on the one hand, and learn to represent God on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we must know the cross, and we must know resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not the church will have a way to go on depends on how we have learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AUTHORITY BEING BASED ON MINISTRY,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AND MINISTRY BEING BASED ON RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man's authority is based on his ministry, and his ministry is based on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without resurrection there is no ministry, and without ministry there is no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without resurrection, Aaron could not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His service was based on resurrection, and his authority before men was also based on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Resurrection enables us to serve before God and establishes us as an authority before men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God will never appoint a man who has no ministry to be His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Authority today is not a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without a spiritual service, there cannot be any positional authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only after a man has a spiritual service before the Lord can he have authority before men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that God will appoint you as an authority among His children only after you have acquired a spiritual ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, authority is based on one's ministry before God, and ministry is based on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, there is no dispute in the matter of authority, for there is no dispute in the matter of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ministry is something given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, authority is also something decided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a ministry has not been given to you, no authority has been assigned to you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All authority is based on service.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without service there is no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Aaron had authority because he had a service before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His censer could make propitiation and stop the plague, while the censers of the other 250 leaders were cursed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The rebellion in Numbers 16 was not only a rebellion against authority, but a rebellion against ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Aaron had a spiritual ministry because he was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was able to be the authority because he had such a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not have any authority that extends beyond our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No one can acquire an authority that goes beyond his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not boast of any authority that is apart from our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to learn to be faithful in our ministry before the Lord and faithful in our authority before men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should have the attitude that we will not go about in things too great or too wondrous for us Psa 131:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to learn to be faithful to our portion before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people make the mistake of thinking that anyone can assume authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Little do they realize that any authority which issues from a ministry never goes beyond its own service to rule over God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Your measure of authority before men must match your ministry before God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The amount of service you have before God determines the amount of authority you have before men.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as authority goes beyond ministry, it becomes a positional authority, and it is no longer spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Authority issues from ministry, and when it flows to others, it brings the presence of God with it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Ministry grows out of resurrection and is rooted in God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a minister misrepresents authority, his ministry will stop, just as Moses' and Aaron's ministries were stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to learn to maintain the Lord's authority and not to say things loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Otherwise, we will suffer God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>GOD'S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a deputy authority makes a mistake, God will step forward to judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His judgment is His vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's vindication is one great principle in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God is willing to commit His name to us; He has allowed us to use His name, just as a man commits his personal seal to another and allows the latter to use it in his name.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This being the case, when we misrepresent God, He will have to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God needs to show man that the mistake is caused by us and not by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Moses and Aaron suffered serious judgment as a result of one mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the end Aaron died and Moses also died.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The greater loss though was their disqualification from entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Neither one of them debated with God; they knew that God's vindication was more important than their entry into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They were willing to allow God to vindicate Himself rather than enter Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In Deuteronomy 32 Moses especially made the point that they, rather than God, had made the mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must maintain the absoluteness of the truth; we should not try to take any shortcuts.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No faithful servant of God should take the cheap way out.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God's vindication is more important than our face, our likes, and our years of prayers and hopes.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Moses and Aaron were meek; they submitted to the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They could have reasoned with God, but they chose, rather, to not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They did not pray for themselves even to the end. They prayed many times for the children of Israel, but they did not pray for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Such silence is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They knew how to let God vindicate Himself, and they willingly took the blame upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When Moses wrote of this in his book, he pointed out that he was the one who made the mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We thank the Lord because here was a servant who knew how to judge himself and who allowed God to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He did not argue in the face of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He did not make proposals lightly and he did not want to control others.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He was humble and gracious, and he feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He is indeed a model for us who are serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>May the Lord give us the grace to be a teachable person.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>May He be gracious to the church in this end time.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We need to pray, "Lord, may Your authority be manifested in the church, and may every brother and sister know what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>May authority be manifested in the local church, and may deputy authority be manifested through man."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I hope that the responsible ones in the church will not make any mistake concerning the matter of authority, and I hope that there will also be no mistake on the part of those who receive orders from the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I hope that everyone will know where he stands so that the Lord will have a free way to go on.</S>
