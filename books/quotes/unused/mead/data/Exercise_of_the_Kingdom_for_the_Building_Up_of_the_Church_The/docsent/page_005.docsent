   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE CONSTITUENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning God, there are two aspects: what God is and what God does.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, God is; secondly, He works and does certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus of Nazareth came with these two aspects of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, He came firstly not to express what God is, but to accomplish what God wanted Him to do for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that Jesus came firstly not as the Son of God, but as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, in Matthew 16:16 Peter said that Jesus was the Christ, and then went on to say that He was also the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE IMPARTATION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we consider the function of the anointed One, we need to see that the Son of the living God is the embodiment of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All that God is has been embodied in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the Son is the essence, the substance, of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father is the source of life, and the Son is the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that the Father is the hidden One and that the Son is the expressed One.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Son is the expression of the Father to be the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, if we have the Son, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As 1 John 5:12 says, He that hath the Son hath life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE FUNCTION OF THE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we need to see how the Son can be imparted into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is accomplished by the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps you have never before realized that when the anointed One was crucified on the cross, He was carrying out His function.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Daniel 9:26 says that the Messiah was to be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His being cut off was His function.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the anointed One was being cut off, He was functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only His death but also His resurrection and ascension were part of His function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the anointed One functioned by being crucified, resurrecting, and ascending, all that the Son might be imparted into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the Christ, the anointed One of God, to accomplish God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s purpose is to impart what He is into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This can only be accomplished by the function of the Christ, the anointed One of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the function of the anointed One, the Son of the living God has been imparted into us, and we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE EXPERIENCE OF PETER</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 16 Peter received the revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, it was not until the day of resurrection that Peter received the Son of the living God into him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On that day, the anointed One of God functioned through His crucifixion and resurrection to impart Himself as the Son of God into Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day of Pentecost the anointed One became Peter s experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the day of resurrection, Peter received the Son of God as life; on the day of Pentecost, he gained Christ for function.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, on the day of resurrection, Peter became a son of God by receiving the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then on the day of Pentecost, Peter was anointed and became part of the anointed One, part of the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is so many Bar-jonas, so many sons of natural fathers, who have received Christ as the Son of God and who have been attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, these Bar-jonas have the Son of God within them as life; on the other hand, they are attached to the anointed One to be part of the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the past we have seen four aspects of the church: first, that it is the gathering of God s called ones; second, that it is the household, the family, of God; third, that it is the Body of Christ; and fourth, that it is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, no matter how clear we may be concerning these aspects of the church, we still need to know what the constituent of the church is and how the church is constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is constituted firstly with the Son of the living God and then with the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Have you been constituted in this way, or are you still a Simon, a son of Jonah?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Remember, on the day of resurrection, Simon Bar-jona, the son of a natural man, was constituted with the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the Son of the living God was wrought into a man of blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the son of Jonah, Peter did not have the element of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Son of God was not a part of his constituent until the day of resurrection, when He was wrought into him through the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, in 1 Peter 1:3 Peter says that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through Christ s resurrection Peter was constituted with the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A new element, a heavenly, divine element, was added to him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The second step took place fifty days later.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the day of Pentecost, Peter was constituted further with the ascended Christ who came down upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the day of resurrection, the Son of God was wrought into him, and on the day of Pentecost the Christ was poured out upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, by the day of Pentecost Peter was fully constituted with Christ within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From that time onward, he was no longer Simon or Bar-jona.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He had become Peter, a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church is a group of sons of flesh and blood who have been constituted with the Son of God within and with the Christ without.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within we have life, and without we have function.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Within we are full of living water, and without we are covered with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus the church is a new constitution.</S>
