   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Triune God Father, Son, and Spirit is a mystery in fact a mystery of mysteries!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Small and finite as human beings are, we can neither understand it thoroughly nor define it in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:1 says, "The Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the clause "the Word was with God," we understand that the Word and God are two, for the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But "the Word was God" indicates that the Word and God are one, for the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Are They one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are both.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says that "the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here the Lord and the Spirit are one, for the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the same verse speaks of "the Spirit of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that They are two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Are the Lord and the Spirit one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Notice that in Hebrews 1:8-9 the Son is addressed as God; then God is referred to as "His" God: "But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever...therefore God, Your God, has anointed You."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can you explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can you say, "O God, Your God"?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Finally, in Revelation 1:4, 4:5, and 5:6 we read that the one Spirit of God Eph 4:4 is called "the seven Spirits."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is another mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dear brothers and sisters, we must learn simply to accept the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This mystery should not bother us too much, however.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many things relating to life are not understandable to men; we can only have a general idea of them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For instance, although we have life in our physical body, no one can explain this life thoroughly, for it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, there is a spirit within us this is even more of a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the life of man?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And what is the spirit of man?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one can give a full explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we cannot comprehend such a comparatively small mystery as man, we should not expect to be able to fully understand the great mystery of the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are many other unexplainable things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Electricity is one example.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With our limited minds we can only understand that some things are so, but we cannot perceive why they are so.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we cannot fully understand something like electricity, how much less can we understand the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we cannot understand this mystery of the Trinity of the Godhead, we can receive and enjoy this mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot understand, but we can enjoy!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In former days men had no knowledge of vitamins, yet they greatly enjoyed their benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Triune God is not for us to understand, but to enjoy.</S>
