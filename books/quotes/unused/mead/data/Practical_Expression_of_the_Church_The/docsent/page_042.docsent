   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABANDON THE AMBITION FOR POSITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another thing we must learn to abandon is the ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church life, there is the temptation of wanting to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all are human.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may say that you do not want to be a leading brother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense I believe you, but in another sense I do not believe you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the church puts you in a position, though you say that you do not like it, you are still so happy about it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And if the church does not put you into a position, you say that you do not care, but you really do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You simply feel unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord knows, and you know too.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You feel that you are older, more experienced and more qualified than others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why are they in the position and you are not?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps you do not say this to others, but it is deep in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have been this kind of "doctor" for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I know all the cases.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you come to me and say you are healthy, I know that you have T.B. What kind of T.B.? It is simply the T.B. of being jealous of those who are in leading positions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You would not say it, but you feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is something secret, something hidden within you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the church were to put you into a leading position, you would function so much in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But since the church has not given you such a place, you come with your mouth shut.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is all because of the self-seeking ambition within you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we come to a local church, we should never consider that we must be an elder or a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether we are an elder or a deacon does not really mean anything as long as we minister Christ as life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if we have no position at all, we should not care.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should just minister Christ continually to others without saying a word about the brothers who are taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I realize that we all love the Lord and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But deeply within all of us, there is the germ of ambition, which must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not deal with this kind of ambition, the fellowship and the church life will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To talk about the church life is easy, but when we practice it, we will see that everything will test us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No place in the entire earth exposes a person like the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church exposes everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We could never be exposed so thoroughly in any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church even exposes the intent within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nothing can be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes people argue about doctrine, but this is just an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they were given a certain position in the church, even the wrong doctrine would not bother them!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we have proper fellowship if we are like this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether we have a position or not, we should be happy that we are in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then it will be very easy to go along with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are the lessons we must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must not insist on anything, we must not expect to be anything, and we should never try to adjust anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The secret is just to be so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whatever the church does, whatever the brothers and sisters do, we should not care.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must simply love them and minister Christ to them, as well as receive the help of Christ from them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should just go along with the church, whatever it does.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the fellowship of the church will be a strong testimony to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I pray that all of these small matters will become very clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May we be wise regarding "the little foxes" that secretly damage the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all must realize these things and be saved from them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must not care for any doctrine, form, or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must not try to adjust others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And we must not desire any position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must simply love the Lord and the church and learn to minister Christ as life to others and receive help in life from others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the proper way we should take in the practice of the church life.</S>
