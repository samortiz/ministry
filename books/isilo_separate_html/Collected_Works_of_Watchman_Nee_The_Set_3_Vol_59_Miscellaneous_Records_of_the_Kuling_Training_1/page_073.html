David was his authority; yet he stole men to himself to listen to his judgment. He attracted men to himself and usurped his father's authority (2 Sam. 15:1-6). He wanted to be appointed king and wanted others to see that he could be a better king than his father. As far as his position was concerned, Absalom was in line to the throne of David. Yet he tried to usurp the throne by his own method. The principle of Absalom was the principle of rebellion; he did not want to subject himself to the authority of David; he tried to establish his own authority instead. Being an authority means to submit to God's authority. Only those who submit to authority can be an authority. Absalom's principle was a deadly one. He tried to usurp authority and assume the kingship by his own flesh. He rebelled against David's authority and attempted to establish his own authority. In the end he was rejected by God. Anyone who tries to assume authority by himself is a rebellious Absalom. His end will be God's sure rejection. Whenever a man tries to be an authority, he is saying that he does not want God's authority. Absalom did not care for God to establish him as the authority. As a result, God did not appoint him as the authority. David was a man who willingly gave up his own authority. In Absalom we see the opposite. This is the reason David found favor in God's sight while Absalom was rejected. Absalom did a fine job when he judged the people at the gate of the city. In man's eyes he was a good judge, but his goal was to usurp authority. God does not want man to be motivated by ambition for authority. If a man craves being an authority, he will end up either in death or rebellion. This is the principle of Absalom. When we move to a place and find someone who wants to be an authority, we should not allow him to be one. (This is different from aspiring for overseership and desiring a good work in 1 Timothy 3:1.)</p><p>We should totally eradicate the ambition for authority within us. We should loathe the desire to rule over others. Unless we are free from these thoughts, we are not worthy of God's trust. If our mind is set on being an authority, we do not know the meaning of submission. We have to learn to submit to authority from our heart. Everyone who murmurs and complains does not know authority. Only submissive ones find others submitting to them. Only an obedient man can lead others to a knowledge of authority. In the world an authority commands respect and admiration from others. In the spiritual realm it is altogether different. In the world only certain kinds of people can be an authority; they have to act certain ways. For example, the principal of a school has to act like a principal. In the spiritual realm, however, an authority does not walk around in pomp and pretense; rather, he is a submissive man. The honor of the high priest is not upon a person himself, but it is given by God (Heb. 5:4). The more submissive a person is, the less he will conduct himself with pomp and pretense outwardly and the less he is likely to become an object of obedience to others. Yet these are the ones who can bring others to submission. This is absolutely different from the way of worldly authorities. We are not here to inspire men to submit to men but to God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS' SUBMISSION</h2><p>Consider the pattern of the Lord Jesus. Philippians 2:8 says that the Lord was obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. The Lord's humbling of Himself was something beyond human imagination. It is hard to fathom such obedience. In verse 5 Paul says that we should let "this mind" be in us, which was also in Christ Jesus. The whole passage concerns taking the mind of Christ. "This mind" is a mind that becomes "obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross" (v. 8). Having the mind of Christ is to have a mind that will obey even unto death. This mind seeks every opportunity to obey. The Son of God was in heaven; He was God, equal with God in rank, power, possession, and existence. Obedience is not a necessity within the Godhead, because there is no distinction of rank, privilege, or greatness between the Father, Son, and Spirit. As such, there is no need of obedience. Yet when Christ came to the earth, He gave up all honor, power, position, and form, and became a common man, being obedient even as a slave.</p><p>One of the wonders of the universe is that Christ refused to return to the Father through the pathway of His divinity. He returned instead through the pathway of obedience. This is like saying that even though man is able to walk on water across the sea, he insists on swimming across it. The Lord "climbed" back to God through learning obedience. The Lord had only one mind in Him. He was simple in His motive. From the beginning to the end His mind was set on obedience. He did not have any thought of gaining authority. During the thirty-three and a half years that He lived the human life, His mind was set on obedience. He did not become obedient by accident or as a result of favorable environment; He was obedient in His very mind. He was obedient everywhere and in everything. To have a mind of obedience means to actively seek for authority to come under. The Lord was always looking for God's will and to obey it. He said, "The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing" (John 5:19). The Son cannot initiate anything; He cannot act according to His own will. This is to have a mind to obey. There may be obedient men on earth, but it is difficult to find a person who has a mind to obey. A person who has a mind to obey is one who seeks for opportunity to obey all the time. He is fearful of losing any opportunity to obey. He is a person bound by obedience. The thought of taking up any form of authority is nonexistent in him. With some people obedience is conditional; they have ulterior motives in their obedience or they obey simply because it happens to fit their preference to obey. A man who has a mind to obey is different. If a man has a mind to gain a place in public office, he will set his mind on using every opportunity to reach his goal. This was how the Son was in His obedience; He was fearful that He would lose His chance for submission. He sought for every opportunity to obey. His mind was not set on being an authority. In order to establish authority, the Lord first established obedience. Without establishing obedience, He could never have established authority. Therefore, Christ came and established God's authority through His obedience. The mind of Jesus of Nazareth was one that sought and reached out for obedience.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> </body></html>
