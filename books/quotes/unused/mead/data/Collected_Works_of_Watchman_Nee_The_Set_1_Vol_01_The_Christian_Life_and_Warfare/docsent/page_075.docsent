   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>See Daniel x. and companion chapter Ephesians vi.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We never wrestle against man, "flesh and blood," but against powers, principalities, &amp;c.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul tells us how to overcome, "withal praying with all supplications," etc., etc. Luke xviii.1-10 Parable . Three in parable 1 Judge.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 Adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A prayer picture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The whole drive of the parable story is to get the judge to join with the widow, to foist the attacks of the adversary against her!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We never will pray up to the full limit of our power, and to the possibility of prayer, until we realize this, that the whole drive of prayer is to foist the power of the Evil One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Thy will be done," i.e., "The other will be undone."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God needs in His great plan for the world more people who will stay where they have been put.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The enemy fears most, next to God, the man who will put his whole life in full touch with the Lord Jesus, and stay where he has been put, and right there keep in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Victory in Jesus' Name is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We want to say "Get thee hence Satan, in my master's Name," and claim for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Evil One must turn back before the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Always keep two in mind when praying:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1 The Satan of the Book of great power and of great dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His whole concern is regarding this earth, and regarding the race of man that is his chief concern not with the outer crowd but in the inner crowd within the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is subtle, powerful, but not all powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2 The Lord Jesus the Victor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Had a running fight for 33 years from cradle to Calvary, and then Satan thought that he had won, but the third morning came, and our Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave His life for us, was Victor, and through Him only can we be ever raised up out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While Satan is great, the Lord Jesus is infinitely greater.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With a whole life in touch with Jesus Christ, with a heart beating with full witnessing in His power, then we can pray "Thy Kingdom come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thy will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Deliver us from the Evil One."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The greatest need to-day God's greatest need is a people who will stay where they have been placed, and keep the whole life in touch with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May there be more of these Victors.</S>
