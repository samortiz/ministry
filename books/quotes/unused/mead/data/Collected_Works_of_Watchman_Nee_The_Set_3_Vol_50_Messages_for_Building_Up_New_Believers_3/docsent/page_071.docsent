   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR HEAD COVERING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:2-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will cover an important subject head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not speak about our status in Christ, but rather of God's order in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This passage does not echo the thought in John 10:30, which says, "I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it says that God is the Head of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not emphasize the relationship between the Father and the Son, but the relationship between God and Christ, between God and His Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not a relationship between God the Father and God the Son in the Trinity of the Godhead, but a relationship between God and the One whom He sent to earth and anointed to be the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The matter of head covering is an issue between God and His Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Neither does the matter of head covering have anything to do with the relationship between Christ and His church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fact that Christ is the Head and the church is His Body is unrelated to head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The matter of head covering involves a totally different issue.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 11:3 says that "Christ is the head of every man."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the Head of individual men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although there are many men, Christ is the Head of them all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His being the Head does not refer to His headship in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His headship in this passage refers to His headship over every man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the subject here has nothing to do with the relationship between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has to do with the relationship between Christ and every man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, it does not refer to a relationship among God's children or to a relationship between brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 3 says that "man is the head of the woman."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must be clear about this foundation before we can understand the meaning of head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I. TWO SYSTEMS OF GOD IN THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would like to consider this subject from a much broader perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will help us to understand 1 Corinthians 11.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only those who know God and who are familiar with the Bible will understand this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This chapter can be difficult reading for many people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thing we have to know is that God has two systems in this universe: One we call the system of grace, and the other we call the system of government.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A. The System of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church, our salvation, the brother-sister relationship in the Lord, and our being God's children these are all items within the system of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything related to the church, the Holy Spirit, and redemption belongs to the system of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The centurion and the Syrophoenician woman both received grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter received grace, and so did Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lazarus could be resurrected, and Martha and Mary could serve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the system of grace, man and woman are placed on equal footing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. The System of Government</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is another system in the Bible which we call God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This system of government is altogether different from the system of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The system of God's government is separate from the system of grace; it is another system altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this system, God operates according to His own pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Creation of Male and Female</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His creation, God created both male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This distinction is related to God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He first created the man and then the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This order was also a matter of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God operates according to His own pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has an independent will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He ordained that human beings would come out of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the Lord Jesus was born of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was related to God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can argue with God in this matter.</S>
