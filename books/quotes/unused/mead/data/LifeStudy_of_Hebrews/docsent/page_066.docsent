   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ULTIMATE SABBATH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are now in the church life, the growing Sabbath that is leading us into the harvest Sabbath of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But not even the harvest Sabbath will be the ultimate Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ultimate Sabbath rest will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time of the New Jerusalem, there will be no more sea, satanic work, or corrupted and polluted world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of that will be in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There will be a new earth, and upon that new earth there will be a city built up with transformed people as the living materials.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That living composition, the New Jerusalem, will be God s complete expression in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There, in the New Jerusalem, we shall see God s expression and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Jerusalem will be God s throne and authority for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate and eternal Sabbath because there God will be fully expressed and represented.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That will be the ultimate consummation of God s work of grace, and we all shall be there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we are diligent or sloppy, our wise Father has a way to perfect us and make us mature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not cooperate with Him, He is patient and will wait for tomorrow, next month, next year, or even for the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the age of the New Jerusalem, there are two ages, this age and the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During both of these ages our patient Father will deal with His naughty children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are naughty and do not participate in the growing Sabbath today, we may miss the harvest Sabbath in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To miss the coming harvest Sabbath does not mean that we shall be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since we are children of the Father, we can never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if we do not behave ourselves in His grace today, making it difficult for our Father to deal with us, we may miss the coming harvest Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, our Father is much wiser than we are and has a way to bring us to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually we all shall be in the New Jerusalem, the ultimate Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There will be a total of three real Sabbaths: the church, the millennial kingdom, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although all these are Sabbaths to God, the second will be better than the first, and third will be fuller than the second.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have the complete assurance that we all shall share in the third and fullest Sabbath, for that Sabbath is wholly a matter of grace, not of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not a prize but our Father s eternal portion for all of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you are a child of the Father, He has a way to make you mature so that eventually you will participate in that third Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>XVI.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OUR NEED TO MATURE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you hear that we all shall be in the New Jerusalem, you may say, Hallelujah, now I am at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I ll be there in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But before we come to the New Jerusalem, we first must pass through the church and then through the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our wise Father uses the church age and the coming age of the millennial kingdom to cause us to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although He has been sown into us, what about the maturity?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His intention is to have all of us matured, and He will accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nothing can stop Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our sloppiness and failures do not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing, including Satan, can stop our Father from accomplishing His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When He chose us, He was not foolish in doing so, but was very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God will never repent of His choice; it is irrevocable and it will stand for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has saved us, and we shall be there in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of this is a work of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has brought us into His salvation, put Himself into us, and is now charging us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the way we grow is up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are obedient, we shall save Him a little time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are disobedient, we shall cause Him some difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But He still has a way to cause us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, if we do not cooperate with Him, we shall suffer the loss of the enjoyment of the church life in this age and the prize in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our wise Father deals with us so that we may mature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not think that you can escape His dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God even has a way to deal with all the Christians who have been saved but are now wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot see this today, but one day we shall see it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How merciful it is that our Father has brought us from wandering in the streets into His church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we are no longer wandering; we are enjoying the church life which helps us to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have the full assurance that the church people will mature earlier and become the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How good it is to enjoy the present church and the coming kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The present church is the Sabbath of enjoyment, and the coming kingdom is the Sabbath of prize.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we enjoy the church well today, we shall receive the kingdom as a prize in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not enjoy the church well today, we shall suffer the loss of the kingdom as a prize in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is very foolish not to enjoy Christ well in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We do not have to pay anything for this enjoyment; it is free.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our Father even encourages us to enjoy Christ well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more we enjoy Christ, the more the Father is happy and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we continue to enjoy Christ, one day the Father will say, Child, since you have enjoyed My Son so much, I shall give you a prize in the harvest Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You will be one of My Son s co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At that time, we shall be Christ s real partners sharing in His kingship in the harvest Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some say that as long as we have been regenerated and are children of God, we shall be in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But the Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, it tells us that we must enjoy Christ, grow, mature, suffer, and overcome for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then in the coming age we shall receive the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This prize is not the eternal portion of the saints but a reward to the overcomers during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you behave yourself in the Father s house, the church, the Father will say, Since you have satisfied Me in My house, I will give you a prize in My kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if we do not satisfy Him today in His house, we shall miss the prize and suffer loss during the next age in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The choice is up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How gracious, righteous, and wise our Father is!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He has prepared a feast and He encourages us all to eat well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The better we eat, the happier He will be.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is foolish not to eat well in the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Oh, how we all need to enjoy the church life!</S>
