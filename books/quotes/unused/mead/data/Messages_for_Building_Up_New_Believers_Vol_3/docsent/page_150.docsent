   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Not Holding On to Anything, Always Letting Go</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times when I read Acts 2 and 4, I get the impression that our so-called real assets such as properties and houses must somehow be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church did this then.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts does not speak of many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet it does say that they had all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one held on to anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s children should always let go of what they have when it comes to supplying other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have any possession, we should either sell it or give it away to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our feeling should always be to share our possession with others, whether it is a knife or a pen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not keep anything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything can go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do this, God will not allow us to go into poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In fact, He will multiply what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>H. The Pattern of the Early Church</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>New believers should realize this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The early church practiced this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the beginning, the twelve disciples told the Lord that they had abandoned all to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By the time of Pentecost, in the first revival, three thousand and five thousand spontaneously sold what they had.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were saved, and like Zaccheus, they did it without many teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I. Selling All without Hearing</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Much Teaching about It</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The twelve disciples did not hear many teachings before they forsook everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord did not tell them to sell all that they had to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He only told them to follow Him Matt 4:19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord called them, they spontaneously dropped everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, the apostles did not tell the first group of three thousand people to sell all that they had.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They sold all their possessions in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Neither did the apostles tell the five thousand to sell all that they had; they did it spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we have to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have heard and believed in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should do what the three thousand and five thousand did; they were also new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is how the church goes on generation after generation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a pity it would be for this family tradition to stop with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should always bring the church back to its original course.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NOT BEING ABLE TO SERVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND MAMMON AT THE SAME TIME</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us turn to Matthew 6, which shows us that our heart must be single in order to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot serve God and mammon at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A. Mammon Being an Idol</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mammon is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have served it for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It has imprisoned our heart for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today if we are to serve the Lord, we have to make a choice between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot serve God and mammon together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord said, Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also v. 21 . A brother said to me once, My treasures are on earth, but my heart is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I responded, You are surely a museum piece, not of the London Museum, but of the Christian Museum.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said that no one can do this, yet you have come up with something that is more miraculous than a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord said that where our treasure is, there will be our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The heart always follows the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot change this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No matter what we say, our heart will always be where our treasure is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>B. Learning to Serve God Alone</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we lay up for ourselves treasures on earth, we will always be serving mammon and not God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is true that we can keep some occupation and engage in some work of production.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But everything that we have should be offered up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to live by the lowest possible standard of living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot serve God and mammon together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do we choose God or mammon?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to choose between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord said that it is not wise to choose mammon, because mammon rusts, and moths consume it v. 19 . The account in our bank may be getting bigger and bigger, but thieves will come and steal it away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to learn to serve God alone and to lay up our treasure in heaven.</S>
