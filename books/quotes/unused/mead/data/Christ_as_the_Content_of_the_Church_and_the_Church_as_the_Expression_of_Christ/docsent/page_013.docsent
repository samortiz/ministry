   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Peace Offering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the experience of Christ as the peace offering Lev 3:1-17; 7:11-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The peace offering signifies Christ as the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we have Christ in our living, this Christ who is practical to us will be our fellowship with God and others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we can have fellowship with God by Christ, this is the peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we can have fellowship with man, this is the peace with man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The peace offering is Christ as our fellowship with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we have peace with a brother, that means we have fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we experience Christ, the more fellowship we will have, and this fellowship is the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we can offer this experience of Christ to God in the church meetings through our thanksgiving, praise, testimony, or message.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not doctrinal but practical.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The peace offering is Christ Himself as the mutual enjoyment between us and God and between us and others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, we enjoy Christ as our peace with fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Sin Offering</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also need to enjoy Christ as our sin offering Lev 4:1-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should never forget that we still have a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regardless of how much we live by Christ and enjoy Christ, we still have our flesh and our sinful nature, so we need Christ as our sin offering to deal with our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Someone may pray, "Lord, we are still in our old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We thank You that You have died for us and have been made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We apply Your blood for our cleansing."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the offering of Christ as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Trespass Offering</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the sin offering, there is the trespass offering Lev 5:1-19 , signifying how Christ deals with our sinful deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sin offering deals with the sinful nature within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The trespass offering deals with the sinful deeds without.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to confess our failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, and shortcomings and apply Christ as our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering are the main items for our experience, whereas the sin offering and trespass offering are subsidiary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we come together, regardless of the kind of meeting we have, we should come with the Christ experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes we offer Him to God as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At other times we may offer Him as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Lord's table meeting, we can offer Him as the peace offering for our fellowship with God and man in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the same time, we cannot forget that we are still in the old, sinful nature and that we are sinful in our deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we can apply Him as our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way the surplus of Christ is offered to God and exhibited to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then our meetings will be enriched and strengthened because they are full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a church life is an exhibition of Christ, an expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ will be expressed through us not only in the building up of the church but also in the church life, in all the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will bear a testimony of being united and built up in Christ to be an expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also, when Christ is offered to God in the church meetings in many aspects, the church meetings will be the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, with the church there are the building aspect and the life aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The life aspect depends on the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In all the meetings, we should have something of Christ to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This depends on our daily labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we daily labor on Christ, we will have something of Christ to bring to our church meetings to contribute to others and offer to God so that we can enjoy Christ with God for the exhibition and exaltation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then Christ will be expressed as the rich content of the church life.</S>
