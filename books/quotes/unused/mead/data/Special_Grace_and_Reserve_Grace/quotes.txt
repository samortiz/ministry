[1]  If we have just come to the Lord, it is understandable if we live by special grace; but if we are still dependent on such grace after we have believed in the Lord for a year or two, this indicates a state of poverty and sickness.
[2]  The other day a few of us talked together about Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians.
[3]  Paul repeated several times that it was his word, not the Lord's. When he spoke, however, he indicated that the word did not seem to be his word, and he concluded with this remark: "I think that I also have the Spirit of God" v. 40 . It is very precious.
[4]  It is a great grief to me that I frequently meet brothers and sisters who are so dependent on special grace that between the periodic help these experiences bring, their words and state of mind lapse into that of a non-Christian.
[5]  Spiritual trials are times when it seems that God has covered His face and shut His mouth, when it seems that He will not answer or make a sound, when it seems He is so quiet that there is no God in heaven at all.
[6]  Many people have spent much time before God, but they have not passed through many experiences before God.
[7]  If one wants to become rich, he must spend time before God, and he must pass through many experiences before God.
[8]  If we have spent the required amount of time and passed through the necessary experiences, we must ask if there has been a result.
[9]  Hopefully, the time we spend before God and the lessons we have learned before Him will have an end. The Lord put His Spirit inside us to enable us to learn the lessons and reach an end. Only then will the Lord be able to use us to supply others.
[10]  We must not just learn the lessons; the Lord must also enlighten us in spirit so that we see what we are learning.
[11]  There are two aspects of the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[12]  God arranges our environment and calls us to submission.
[13]  We do not have any intention of submitting, but the Holy Spirit works on us to the extent that we submit nevertheless.
[14]  Many times we want to submit quickly, and we ask God to give us grace that we might submit.
