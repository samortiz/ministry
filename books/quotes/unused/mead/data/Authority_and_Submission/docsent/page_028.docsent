   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Rebellion Being Related to the Walking after the Lust in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's rebellion is especially related to the indulgence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Peter 2:10 the flesh and the lust were first mentioned, then those who despise lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The expression of this despising of lordship is shown in reviling words, words of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Particular kinds of people live among those who are of their own kind; they have communication with their kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rebellious ones always accompany those who walk after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are also the ones who accompany those who indulge in the lust of uncleanness and who despise lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God's eyes, walking after the flesh, indulging in lust, and despising lordship are all the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such ones are presumptuous, self-willed, and not afraid of speaking evil of dignities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But those who know God are fearful on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mouth has a lust, which is to speak evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we know God, we will be repentant and remorseful, because we will realize how much God hates this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The angels were under those with lordship at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, they dare not revile them with evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They dare not deal with a lawless spirit by lawless means.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, if we live before God, we cannot revile others with reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please notice that it is possible to speak reviling words even in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>David could say that Saul was God's anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This proves that he was one who kept the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The power of Satan is established upon lawlessness, while the angels are those that would not overstep their position.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peter used this as an example to show us that since the angels in the heavens are like this, we should be like that even more v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are only two things that cause a Christian to lose his power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One is sin, and the other is speaking evil of those above him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more evil speaking, the more power is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man's lack of submission is in his heart only, without corresponding utterances from his mouth, his power will not be lost as fast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The effect of speaking is much more serious than we can imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To God, man's thoughts and conduct are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as there is a thought, a sin is committed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Matthew 12:34-37 also says that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the day of judgment, we will be judged righteous or sinful according to the words we have spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows us that there is a difference between words and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there are no words, there is still the possibility of covering up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if the words come out, everything is thrown into the open.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, disobedience in heart is a little better than openly speaking with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today Christians lose their power through their mouth in no less measure than they lose it through their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, more is lost through the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All rebellious ones have trouble with their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, if a man cannot restrict himself in words, he cannot restrict himself in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God Rebuking the Rebellious Ones with the Strongest Words</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Look again at 2 Peter 2:12, which says, "But these, like animals without reason, born natural for capture and destruction " This is the strongest word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no word of rebuke more serious than this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why does the Bible rebuke these ones as animals?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is because these ones have no feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Authority is the most central thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, to God reviling is the most serious of all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The mouth cannot speak lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As soon as a man meets God, his mouth will be restricted, and there will be a fear of reviling dignities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we meet authority, there will be a sense of authority in us, in the same way that there will be a sense of sin once we meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Problems in the Church Arising Frequently from Reviling Words</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The oneness and the power of the church are broken through man's careless words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today the majority of the problems in the church come from evil speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only a minority come from real difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The majority of the sins in the world also come from lies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If evil words are stopped in the church, the majority of our problems will be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to repent before the Lord and ask for His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Evil speaking needs a thorough termination in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Out of one spring there cannot issue two kinds of water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Out of one mouth there cannot issue words of love and words of reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May God set a watchman upon our mouth, and not only upon our mouth, but also upon our heart so that all words and thoughts of reviling would be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May evil speaking depart from among us from this day forward.</S>
