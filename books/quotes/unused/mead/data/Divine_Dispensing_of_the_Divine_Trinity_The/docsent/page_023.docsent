   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE FORERUNNER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 6:20 tells us that Christ is the Forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are all runners, running from all the things outside of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We run into God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first One who was running into God was the man Jesus Christ, the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was the forerunner, running from anything other than God into God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is now within the veil in the Holy of Holies where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was the first to get there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was the forerunner, and we also are running the same race.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are running into God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ took the lead to run this race, and He is bringing us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AS THE HIGH PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As our High Priest He prays for us and takes care of our case Heb 4:14; 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He sustains us and supplies us with all our need for the purpose of dispensing God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AS OFFERINGS FOR SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is also the offerings for sin and sins Heb 9:26, 28; 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First of all He is the sin-offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the offering for sin in the singular number, referring to our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then He is also the offering for sins, in the plural number.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are our trespasses and offenses and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the offering both for sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin is the biggest obstacle which frustrates God from dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ has solved this problem, taking away our sin, to remove the obstacle so that God can have a free way to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He offered one sacrifice for sins, dealing with all our trespasses and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today the way is fully cleared up for us to contact God and for God to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a free way and a free course for God to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>13.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AS THE PASSOVER</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is also our Passover 1 Cor 5:7 .</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even God cannot condemn us Rom 8:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have such a Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the day of the Passover the blood of the lamb was shed for all the children of Israel, and God s condemnation passed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That was the Passover so that the children of Israel might eat the meat of the lamb to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So the Passover is for the dispensing of life into the redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AS THE MEDIATOR</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is our Mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A mediator is a middle man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When there are problems between two parties, there is the need of a mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There were problems between us and God, but Christ is our Mediator to make everything right so that God can dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, in my home we use electricity for light, for heating, for cooling, for power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes there is the problem with the air conditioner or with the heater or with the lights.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So we always need a mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We call a dear brother who lives in Anaheim to come and look at the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With God there is no problem, but with us there are many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Just a little unhappiness with your wife becomes a problem and the heavenly electricity doesn t work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then you have to call upon the Mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When you call upon Him, He is very present.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He clears up your problem and right away God flows once again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Just a little wrong attitude hinders God flowing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Again you have to call upon the Mediator: O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then the flow is restored.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ is the surety of the better covenant Heb 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With an agreement or contract, there is the need of a guarantee or a guarantor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Jesus Christ is both the guarantee and the guarantor for dispensing God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order for God to dispense Himself into us He made a covenant with us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To assure us of His dispensing Himself into us, God signed the contract.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is the guarantee and the guarantor, the surety, of this contract.</S>
