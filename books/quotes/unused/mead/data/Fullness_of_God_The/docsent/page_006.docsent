   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN BEING CREATED IN GOD S IMAGE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO GOD S LIKENESS TO CONTAIN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of the new believers may wonder how the fullness of God is related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning this we would present two crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One point is the meaning of God s fullness, and the other is that man was created for God s fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Genesis 1:26 says, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God created man in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 9:23 says, In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God not only made man in His image; He also made man as a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This vessel has God s likeness in order to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Any valuable object is usually contained in a box, and the shape of the box is determined by the object it contains.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man is a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is for this purpose that God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, man is not a coat hanger to be draped with clothes or a food bag to contain food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meaning of human life is not related to clothing, food, housing, or transportation; it is not related to eating three meals a day and sleeping at night.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The meaning of our human life is in the content of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man is a vessel created by God to contain God; therefore, man is an empty vessel if he does not contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason we need to realize that we are precious vessels, just as a box that contains a diamond is a precious box.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As vessels created by God to contain Him, we are very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, many believers testify that there was meaning in their human life after they received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I was thirteen or fourteen years old, I had a few good friends, and even though we encouraged one another to strive for the best, we still felt the emptiness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many elderly brothers and sisters have had this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether a person is a government official, a teacher, or a businessman, whenever he is calm, he has the feeling that life cannot merely be a matter of food, clothing, and work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>People have had many considerations concerning the meaning of human life, but they have never found an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day God caused the wind of the gospel to blow on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Throughout the past two thousand years this gospel wind has been blowing everywhere on the earth through the continuous preaching of thousands of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was a time when it was considerably difficult for a Western missionary to go to China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some of them spent six months sailing in a boat and suffered nausea and illness during their journey only to die after they arrived in China.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, however, transportation is convenient, and the various means of communication are even more convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This environment is favorable for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the gospel wind is blowing everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When this wind blows on a person, it causes him to receive the Lord, and he immediately feels that life is no longer empty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He feels that life is full of content and meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although there are different races on the earth with different skin colors yellow, brown, black, white, and red the need within everyone is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus is mankind s common need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the all-inclusive dose that is suitable for every kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genesis 1 shows that man was created by God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God created man according to His likeness so that man could receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is now the life-giving Spirit, and all the riches of God are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His love, grace, life, light, holiness, righteousness, kindness, forbearance, forgiveness, mercy, compassion, and caring are all in the Spirit, and the Spirit is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We not only need to believe in God; we also need to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We receive Him simply by opening our mouth to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This can be compared to receiving air through breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our calling is our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we say, O Lord Jesus, He enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can all testify that even when we softly call on the name of the Lord in a meeting, we are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is by calling on the Lord that we receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way God enters into us, His vessels, and His riches are contained in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After God enters into us, He desires to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more He fellowships with us, the more living we become, and the more we call on Him and breathe Him in, the more He fills us.</S>
