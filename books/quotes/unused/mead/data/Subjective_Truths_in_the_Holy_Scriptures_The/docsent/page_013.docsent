   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS CONCERNING THE CHURCH IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 20:17; 15:5a; 3:28-29; 14:2, 23; 1 Cor 10:17; Heb 2:12; Eph 5:30-32; 1 Tim 3:15a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John speaks repeatedly about how we should have subjective experiences of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He became flesh for the purpose of working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He became the living water that we may drink Him, the bread of life that we may eat Him, and the breath of life that we may breathe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nothing can be more subjective than the subjective experiences produced when water, bread, and breath get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to receive the Lord into us so subjectively that it is like receiving water, food, and air into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we have to see that these subjective experiences are for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the subjective experiences that are linked to the Spirit and are hinged on life are for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The issue of our receiving the Lord into us is that we become constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be sure, in the Gospel of John we are shown the subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Though the term church is not used, we should not overlook the fact that this book speaks of how the constituents of the church are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WE BEING MANY GRAINS GROUND INTO ONE BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Scripture reading above, five crucial points are presented.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, the Lord said that He was a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This grain of wheat fell into the ground and died, and it bore much fruit 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These many grains are the increase of Christ, the reproduction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Originally it was one grain; then this grain died and grew up to become many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ was the one grain, and we are the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were not the many grains by our human birth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord's life came into us and the Lord dispensed Himself into us, we were regenerated to become the many grains to be made into one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though we are many, "there is one bread" 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally the many grains were grains individually, but now they have been ground to powder and blended together to become one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This one bread signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every time we break the bread at the Lord's table we testify that the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This bread is one Body, and this one Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we must see that the church is not a composition originated by human will; it is not an organization worked out by a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is not the church; that is a society.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A society is organized by people, whereas the church is produced out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is an issue of His dispensing into us through His death and resurrection to make us grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we as the grains of wheat are blended into one, we become the one bread, and this one bread signifies the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we have to see here that the church is produced by Christ's entering into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, the church is produced by our subjective experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If Christ did not enter into you, you would remain only of the Adamic race; you would not be a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, because Christ entered into you, He as the one grain of wheat made you a grain of wheat also.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is how the church is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>WE BEING THE MANY BROTHERS OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, in John 20, after His resurrection, the Lord said to Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them " v. 17 . Before His death and resurrection, when the Lord was on earth, He never called His disciples brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He called them friends, but He never called them brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was because at that time the Lord's life had not yet entered into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was through resurrection and in resurrection that His life entered into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now since they had His life, they became the Lord's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to Hebrews 2:12, these brothers are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There it says, "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is the composition of the Lord's many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Individually, we are the Lord's brothers; corporately, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is the composition of the firstborn Son and the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But how can we become the Lord's brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must see that we are not the Lord's foster brothers; we are the Lord's own brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are His own brothers because we have His life and His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as He has the life of God, we also have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Just as He has the nature of God, we also have the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the firstborn Son of God, and we are the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we are His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In aggregate we, the many brothers, are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One cannot become a constituent of the church merely by being baptized and "joining the church" yet without receiving the Lord into him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In my youth every Sunday morning I went to a chapel for Sunday worship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At a certain point in time the pastor and elders considered me quite good and therefore baptized me one Sunday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way I became a member of their "church."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the fact is that I did not pray or confess my sins, nor did I read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Would you consider that to be the church?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No. Today you and I have to be clear that the church is a composition of the Lord's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord Jesus is God's firstborn Son, and we are God's many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every one of us, the sons, has the life and nature of God the Father, and when we are put together, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is realized when we experience the Lord in such a subjective way.</S>
