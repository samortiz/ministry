REGENERATION</H2><P>In the next five lessons we will see some major aspects of the Spirit's work in the believers. The Spirit's work is mainly within the believers; it is for the dispensing of God into man. Regeneration is the reality and initiation of the divine dispensing. As the Spirit, God dispenses His life and nature into our being. Only by being the Spirit is God able to regenerate us. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Born of the Spirit</H2><P>[According to the Bible, to be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit (John 3:3-6). Before regeneration our spirit was dead. "And you, being dead in your offenses and sins" (Eph. 2:1). But at the time we believed, God's Spirit came into us and mingled with our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:16). Thus, our spirit obtained God's life and was made alive. Whereas our parents gave us our natural birth, God's Spirit has given us our spiritual birth.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Born Again</H2><P>[Regeneration also means to be born again or born anew. Originally we were born of our parents, but now we are born once more, this time of God. The Bible calls this experience being born again. When we were born of our parents, we obtained human life. When we were born of God, we obtained God's divine life.]</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 3: Two Spirits-Two Spirits - the Divine Spirit and the Human Spirit &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
