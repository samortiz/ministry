   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE VICTORY OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next to God, death is the most powerful thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one can turn death away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one, that is, except the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the only One who has gone into death and come out living, never to return to death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is both God and resurrection John 1:1; 11:25 , possessing the indestructible life Heb 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since He is such an ever-living One, death is not able to keep Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to hold Him Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Over Death and Hades</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus was in the domain of death for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He took a good look at death and found it to be powerless to hold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So on the third day the Lord Jesus simply walked out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He might have said, "Death, I have finished my mission; you can do nothing with Me, and I am not afraid of you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now is the time for Me to walk out of your domain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not in a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I could stay here for another day if I wanted to, but now it is time to leave."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was not fearful of death, running away from the tomb; rather, He peacefully took the time to fold His burial clothes and put them in good order John 20:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a testimony of His victory over death!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His resurrection, the Lord Jesus also took away the authority of death and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why in Revelation 1:18 the Lord says, "I have the keys of death and of Hades."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because man fell into sin, death came in and is now working on earth to gather up all of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death resembles a dustpan used to collect dust from the floor, and Hades resembles a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever the dustpan collects is put into the trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, death is a collector and Hades is a keeper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Death and Hades tried their best, but they could not keep Christ in their domain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Praise the Lord, death is subject to Him and Hades is under His control.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ has the keys of death and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. Over Satan and the World</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's resurrection is also a testimony of His victory over Satan and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In His crucifixion Christ dealt with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 2:14 says that "through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also, when the Lord spoke to His disciples of His coming crucifixion, He said, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out" John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord took care not only of Satan, but also of Satan's system, the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After finishing such a great task on the cross, Christ came out of death and Hades triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Satan and the world did not fare so well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ defeated them by His death and left them in the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His resurrection is a demonstration of that victory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Are you impressed by Christ's resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has overcome the strongest enemy death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes you may feel as though you were dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But consider the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He actually went into death and Hades, and came out triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your situation can never be worse than what the Lord Jesus went through.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This living One is now in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you feel depressed and weak, do not pray that the Lord would make you strong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All you need to do is to boldly declare, "Christ is resurrected!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has overcome death and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praise Him, He is Victor!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After such a prayer, you will proclaim as the Apostle Paul did: "Death has been swallowed up in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where, O death, is your victory?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where, O death, is your sting?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1 Cor 15:54-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Death could not hold Christ; neither can it hold those who are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>QUESTIONS Discuss the significance of God raising Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Explain why Christ was raised for our justification Rom 4:25 .</S>
