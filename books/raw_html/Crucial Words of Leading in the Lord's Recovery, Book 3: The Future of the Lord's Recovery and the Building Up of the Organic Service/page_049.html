	 <h2 class="head2">Raising Up the Work<br />
in Taiwan and Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Beginning in 1946, a small number of saints began migrating to Taiwan. More saints migrated in 1947 and even more in 1948. By the end of 1948 there were thirty to fifty saints meeting in the church in Taipei. When I came to Taiwan in the spring of 1949, there were less than one hundred saints in the church in Taipei. In August we built a small meeting hall where hall one is now located, and we officially began the work. Our numbers increased very quickly, and by the end of 1949, the number of saints meeting in the church in Taipei had increased to around nine hundred.</p>
<p>In November of 1950 the Lord led me to go to Manila in Southeast Asia. From then on, I spent approximately four months of every year in the Philippines. Most of the remaining time I spent giving trainings in Taipei. Prior to 1952, a sister and I were the only full-time serving ones. In 1952 we increased to approximately one hundred full-time serving ones. As a result, the work on the island of Taiwan increased and spread, and churches were established in almost all the major cities of Taiwan from Keelung in the north to Kaohsiung in the south and even in Hualien and Taitung on the east. The full-time serving ones spread to these localities to care for the churches for the furtherance of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, during 1954 and 1955 the number of saints in Taiwan increased to almost fifty thousand. Two years later, from 1956 to 1957, our numbers reached fifty thousand. In other words, we began with a small number of less than five hundred saints, and in six to seven years we experienced a one hundredfold increase&mdash;we had fifty thousand saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problems of Being Distracted<br />
and of Losing the Leading at the Basic Level</h2>
<p>At the time of our increase in numbers we wanted to receive help in order to pursue spiritual growth, so we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to come to minister to us. He came the first time in 1955 and again in 1957. His coming, however, caused problems among us and brought in a storm. As a result of the influence from Brother Sparks, several young brothers had a change of heart and began to dissent. That was a great distraction to the work. It has been approximately twenty-seven years since that storm, but our numbers have not increased; they have remained stagnant.</p>
<p>During the first few years of the work in Taiwan, our numbers increased quickly. In Taipei we increased from one meeting hall to several meeting halls, every meeting hall was divided into several district meetings, and every district meeting was divided into several small groups. Looking back, we must confess that our practice of every meeting hall being divided into several districts and every district being further divided into many small groups was appropriate and effective. The advantage of this practice was that newly saved ones were taken care of by the small groups. However, we became distracted by Brother Sparks&rsquo;s visit and no longer paid attention to the service in the districts and in the small groups. Later, the small groups gradually disappeared, and the districts were rearranged.</p>
<p>According to our rearrangement, the church in Taipei had more than twenty districts, but there were no more small groups. Thus, the basic level of service disappeared. As a result, our care for the brothers and sisters, especially our cherishing of the new ones, was not as effective. Many brothers and sisters were not cared for, and the newly saved ones were not appropriately supported. Subsequently, the number of people in the church gradually decreased, even though the brothers and sisters faithfully maintained the Lord&rsquo;s testimony and preached the gospel to gain new ones. Despite these efforts, our numbers fell far below the fifty thousand we had gained more than twenty years ago.</p>
<p>For the past three or four years, I have been observing our situation. Even though I have not been in Taiwan, I have had a burden for Taiwan. I have been observing the situation in Taiwan from afar. I have also had thorough fellowship with the responsible brothers and the elders. We have constantly been seeking how a church as large as the church in Taipei should go on.</p>
<p>Even though we were distracted and had problems in 1957, the situation remained with us until September 1965 when I came back from America to deal with it. As a result of the problems, the church was like a person who, having suffered a long-term illness, had been cured by an operation and needed a long period to recover his strength. The operation was in September 1965, and we needed one to two years to recover our strength. I visited Taiwan in 1966, 1967, and 1968.</p>
<p>During those three years, I asked the brothers in Taipei to find the address records of all the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei. According to the reports they gave me, we had names and addresses for about twenty-three thousand saints in the church in Taipei. Over the intervening years, the population and territory of Taipei changed considerably, and many streets and addresses changed. Now we have the names and addresses for only eleven thousand saints. This is significantly less than the twenty-three thousand saints we had from 1966 to 1968. The main reasons for this decrease in number are that the saints moved, emigrated, or passed away. However, according to my observation, the main reason for the decrease in number is that we lost our leading at the basic level.</p>
