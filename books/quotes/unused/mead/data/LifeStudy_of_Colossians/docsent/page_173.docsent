   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BROUGHT INTO THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The enjoyment of Christ also brings us into the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we are in the heavenlies experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that through the enjoyment of Christ, we become heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only are we no longer natural, but we are no longer earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The enjoyment of Christ causes us to be both in resurrection and in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we enjoy Christ, the more we are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, to hold Christ as the Head is to be in the heavens in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also true to say that to be in the heavens is to hold the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Experientially, holding the Head and being in the heavens are one and the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If in our experience we temporarily abandon Christ and do not continue holding Him as the Head, we shall sense that we are earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, suppose a sister does not hold Christ as the Head in the matter of shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then at least temporarily, during the time she is shopping, she has given up the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same may be true in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a husband and wife are exchanging words, they certainly are not in the heavenlies in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say the least, they are earthly, for when they are arguing, they are not holding Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we are earthly, we are not holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if in our married life we consistently enjoy Christ, we shall hold Him as the Head and be in the heavens in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we shall be a heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing will be able to pull us down from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unfortunately, in our experience we quickly make this descent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even a single word or unpleasant look can cause us to fall from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How quickly in our daily living we may cease from holding the Head!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to 3:1-4, our living should be in the heavens, where God s throne is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, Christ as our Head is in our spirit; on the other hand He is in the heavens, not on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only when we are in the heavens do we hold Him as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To enjoy Christ is to hold the Head, and to hold the Head is to be in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OUR NEED TO BE IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How in our experience can we be in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can be experientially in the heavens only by enjoying Christ, the Head, as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, Now the Lord is the Spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>. If Christ were only the Head and not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to contact Him or hold Him experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But although Christ s position is that of the Head, in our experience He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to 2 Timothy 4:22, the Lord, who is the Spirit, is now with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the heavens, Christ is the Head, but in our spirit, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, to hold Christ as the Head is not only to enjoy Him and to be in the heavens, but it is also to be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would hold the Head, we must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2:18 Paul uses the expression vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The mind is part of the soul, and the flesh is related to the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anyone who is puffed up by the mind of the flesh does not hold Christ as the Head, for he is in his fleshly mind, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we are in the mind or in the flesh, we are not holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when we turn from the flesh and from the mind to the spirit, we automatically hold Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we linger in our fleshly mind, we shall not be able to touch Christ or hold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we turn to the spirit, we shall hold the Head, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have seen that to hold Christ as the Head involves three things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To hold the Head we must enjoy Christ, we must be in the heavens, and we must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From our experience we know that these three matters go together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we enjoy Christ, we are in the heavens and in our spirit, not in the mind or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be in the spirit is experientially to be in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the Bible, the Holy of Holies is both in the third heaven and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever we turn to the spirit, we are in the heavens enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the way to hold the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>ABSORBING THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>FOR THE GROWTH OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we enjoy Christ and hold Him as the Head, we absorb His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to 2:19, something proceeds out from the Head which causes the Body to grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we enjoy Christ in the heavens and in our spirit, we hold the Head and absorb His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then out from the Head something will proceed to produce the growth of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that more of the element of God is added into our being and thereby into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This causes the Body to grow with the growth, the increase, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As we hold the Head, we absorb the riches of the extensive, all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These riches are the elements of God, the very elements that proceed out from the Head and become in us the increase of God by which the Body grows.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, the Body will be the one new man in which Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because Christ is the unique constituent of the new man, He is every member of the new man and in every member.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To hold Christ as the Head is to enjoy Him continually, to be in the heavens, and to remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Through holding Christ as the Head, we become conscious of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Experiencing the Body life, we absorb the riches out from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These riches are the very elements of God which become in the members of the Body the increase of God by which the whole Body grows.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, the growth of the Body is the product of enjoying Christ, holding Him as the Head, and absorbing His riches.</S>
