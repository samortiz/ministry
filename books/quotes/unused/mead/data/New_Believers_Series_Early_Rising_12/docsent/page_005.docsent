   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>You may face a little difficulty at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is always easy the first and second day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the third day is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You will find it easy for the first few days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But after a few days, you will love the bed so much that you will not want to get up at all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is especially true in winter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It takes a long time for us to build up a new habit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps you are used to getting up late, and your mind has been used to getting up late.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if you rise up early a few times, your mind will gradually adjust to getting up early.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After you do this for a few days, you will not want to go back to sleep even if your mind is telling you to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the beginning you will need to force yourself a little in order to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before a habit is built up, you need to ask God for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Continue to ask until this habit is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Try to do this again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Give up your bed daily to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the end you will rise up early spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must build up this habit before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must not miss the grace of fellowship early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A healthy person does not need more than eight hours of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not think that you are an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not worry that early rising will affect your health.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It may be your anxiety which is affecting your health.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people love themselves too much and worry themselves to sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may need ten or twelve hours of sleep if the doctor says that you are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But six to eight hours of sleep are sufficient for a normal person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, do not go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Maintain at least six to eight hours of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not expect those who are sick to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are sick, it is all right for you to lie on your bed in the morning and read your Bible there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, those who are not advised by doctors to stay in bed and who are not really sick should rise up early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We hope those who are mature and weighty in the Lord will uphold this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church should push the sluggard ones to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They should be shaken up a little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should usher the new believers into this great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You should take every chance to ask the new ones, "What time do you get up every day?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After a few days, you have to ask them again, "What time did you get up this morning?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of reminding should go on for at least a year into a person's initial Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After a year, you may still need to ask, "Brother, what time do you rise up now?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ask the new believers whenever you see them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You need to go to them and render them some help in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if we have not learned the lesson well before the Lord, it will be hard for us to do this to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why we must first learn this lesson well ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Early rising should be a believer's first habit among all habits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Giving thanks before meals is a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Meeting together on the Lord's Day is also a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rising up early is even more an essential habit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A new believer needs to build up this habit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is unfortunate that some have been Christians for years and yet have never enjoyed the blessing of early rising.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They have never enjoyed the grace of early rising.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we want to experience this grace, we have to learn this lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If more brothers and sisters will come together to learn this lesson, and if everyone will rise up early in the morning, the church will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When one brother receives more light, the whole church will receive more shining.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When everyone receives a little more light each day, the church as a whole will become richer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church is poor today because too few people are receiving their supply from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If everyone receives something from the Head, however little it may seem to be, the culmination of all the little portions will make the whole very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not wish to see only a minority of people working in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We hope to see all the members rising up before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We hope to see the whole church rising up to receive God's riches and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What one member receives from the Head becomes the profit of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If every brother and sister takes this way, there will be many containers before God, and we will be richer and richer as the days go by.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We hope that you will not consider early rising as a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we all learn to rise up early, and if we all maintain this habit, we will have a bright spiritual future ahead of us.</S>
