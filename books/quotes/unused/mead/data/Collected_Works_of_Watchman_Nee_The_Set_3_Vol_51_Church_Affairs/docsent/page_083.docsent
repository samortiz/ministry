   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fishing and Tentmaking Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Two Different Matters</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a brother thinks that he cannot do the work well or that he has financial difficulties, he may go to teach or to fish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I tell you that when the Lord died, many did go fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But, when the Lord died, could you say that our Lord was living forever in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the disappointed ones went fishing!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But here was a person who went to make tents not out of disappointment; there was no disappointment at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are two different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter's fishing and Paul's tentmaking were two entirely different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter's fishing was his arriving at a dead end with no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter's fishing meant that he considered the Lord to have died, to be finished, to be terminated, and that everything was hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He considered himself as a failure, and the Lord had died; therefore, he went fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers, you must take note that Paul's tentmaking was not an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul had clearly determined that the Lord was living, and he could not help but be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If it was comfortable, he would be an apostle, and if it was a suffering, he would still be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he received money, he would be an apostle, and if he did not receive any money, he would still be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When there was the support from the brothers, he would be an apostle, and when there was no support, he would still be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is an entirely different matter from Peter's fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To live was to be an apostle, and to die was also to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he needed to endeavor, he would still endeavor to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He put his two hands to it; besides all the work and all the labor, he was willing to do one more work so that the work of the apostles would not collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was this way not only toward himself, but also toward those who were with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By the work of his two hands he supported himself and also those who were with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the way in which Paul walked.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not Changing Occupations</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>but Endeavoring All the More</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, brothers and sisters, we need to see this basic principle: All who go out to preach the gospel, who have been called by the Lord to serve Him fully in the gospel, who are apostles, whether brothers or sisters, need to throw away their occupation entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should drop everything to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, when there is the need and if we can bear the extra burden to work for a short period of time, then we may work, but not as the tax collectors who work day and night in the tax office.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is no such need, then we do not have to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the church has no way to support or when the church does not support, as in the days when the Israelites did not give the offerings and the Levites were hungry, we may work a little on the side to help ourselves and our co-workers and still be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please remember, the principle of tentmaking not only does not distract us, but it makes us single-hearted all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only is it not a hindrance, but rather it is a help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only is it not the changing of our occupation, but rather it is the bettering of our occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, this means we need to endeavor all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to bear the work which the Lord has assigned to us and the responsibility which the Lord has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we want to bear it, we will use all our means to bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is right to go out to work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This I say in reference to the apostles specifically.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE SCOPE OF THE DEFINITION OF A CO-WORKER BEING WIDER THAN THAT OF AN APOSTLE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What about the co-workers?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The scope of the definition of a co-worker is actually wider than that of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Aquila and Priscilla were both co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Phoebe was a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The responsible elders and deacons in every church were also co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Requiring the Occupation of Every Person</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>to Be Secondary</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We would ask all the brothers and sisters to change their occupation into a secondary occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is good, even very good, if in your locality you have the means to support yourself and you completely give up your occupation simply to serve God in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is also good if in this locality you serve God, bear the local responsibility with the ministry of the word, or take part in the office or in the service, while doing something to support yourself and others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not know whether or not you have seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Among us no brother or sister lives for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No brother or sister fishes for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Among us all the brothers and sisters fish for their office or their service.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If this is the case, the problem of occupation can be resolved very easily.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you are clear concerning your office, then you will be clear about your occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are not clear about your office or service, let me say that your occupation will be absolutely useless before God.</S>
