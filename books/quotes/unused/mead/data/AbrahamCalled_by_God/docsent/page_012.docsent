   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Isaac's Experience Isaac is another illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Isaac's experience was without beginning or end. He was never called and he never matured.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although he blessed his sons, he did it blindly 27:18-29 , not so clearly as Jacob did with his grandsons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaac needed the beginning of both Abraham's and Jacob's experiences and the end of Jacob's experience for his completion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaac was in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was never dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although his father and son were dealt with, he did not need any dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was fully covered by the two ends in the matter of God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times it is good for us to stay in the midst of other members of the Body, for those ahead of us and those behind us become our completion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the coordination among the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jacob's Experience In his experience, Jacob had the best, highest, and most matured end. Although he began as a subtle supplanter, after being dealt with by God, he matured to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although there are so many good ones, such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, in the book of Genesis, no one is as mature as Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After he matured, his supplanting hands became blessing hands.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever someone came under his hands, there was no condemnation, only blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He not only blessed the descendants of faith but even the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was so high and so mature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Jacob was matured in life, he had neither the experience of being called nor of the life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Neither did he have the experience of the inheriting of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For his completion, Jacob needed to have Abraham's being called and Abraham's experience in the life of faith as well as Isaac's experience in the inheriting of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jacob was poor in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not know how to believe; he only knew how to supplant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Abraham had been blessed by Melchisedec following the slaughter of kings, he met the king of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The king of Sodom encouraged Abraham, who had gained the victory for him, to take the spoil for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Abraham refused to take even one thread, believing in the sufficiency of the Almighty God 14:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham had received the blessing from Melchisedec and did not need help from the king of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was Abraham's experience of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But Jacob's experience was very different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever he went, he was the first to supplant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the midst of his supplanting life, Jacob even made a deal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God appeared to him in a dream at Bethel, Jacob said upon waking, "If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on then shall the Lord be my God and of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" 28:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jacob made a deal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God would take care of his needs, Jacob would give Him ten percent in return.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob seemed to be saying, "O God, if You will take care of my food, clothing, and all my needs, then I will give You a ten percent commission."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to that arrangement, Jacob received ninety percent and God only ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We see by this that Jacob did not have Abraham's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, however, Jacob was fully matured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He reached such a high level of maturity that Joseph, a part of Jacob, was reigning over the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time, the world was under the hand of Pharaoh, and Pharaoh's authority was altogether with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a very real sense, Joseph did not reign for Pharaoh but for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here we see the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The New Testament ends with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the called ones have completed their experiences with the Triune God, the period of reigning will come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That will be the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Joseph only reigned for a period of years, but in the kingdom we shall reign for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we add together the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we have a clear portrait of the complete experience of the called one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a help in doing this, let us consider the chart that is printed on page 31.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As God's called ones, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were chosen in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then, in time, after their birth, they were called.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many years after Abraham was called, he was circumcised and his name was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is indicated by the curve.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is one line, or one aspect, of the experience of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We see from this chart that Isaac's experience is a straight line.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It resembles a tasteless glass of plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We see another curve when we come to Jacob's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After this supplanting one was touched and dealt with, he became a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually, all three of the called ones became a straight line.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will all be there in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We see from this chart that Jacob, or Israel, includes Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason for this is, as we have seen, that Joseph was the reigning part of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While Jacob was a prince of God, Joseph was the one who reigned over the world, reigning over all the earth for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Joseph was the reigning son and Jacob was the reigning father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the complete experience of the corporate called one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we see this, we shall bow down and say, "O God the Father, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need Your plan, purpose, selection, predestination, calling, justification, acceptance, and care.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>O God the Son, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need You to redeem us that we might have the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need You to accomplish all that the Father planned, all that the Father intended to do.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>O God the Spirit, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need You to regenerate us, to discipline us, to transform us, and to make us grow that we might mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need You to make us the real Israels.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need You to make all that the Father has planned and all that the Son has accomplished real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our Triune God, how we bow to You, worship You, praise You, and thank You for all that You have done to us and in us!"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After seeing such a thing, we shall be humbled and realize that the whole experience of the corporate called one is too much for us to have individually.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I cannot be Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since I can only be one of these three, I must learn to rely upon my brothers for the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even if I were as mature as Israel, I would still need someone to be my Abraham and my Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all must realize that, at the most, we are only a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>According to our traditional background, everyone ranks Abraham at the top, thinking that he exceeds everybody else.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But he did not exceed everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although he exceeded others in the matter of faith, he did not surpass them in maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As we have seen, Jacob was the most mature.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>At present we are all in the process of this experience of God's called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some of us are Abrahams, some are Isaacs, and others are Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now we are enjoying the Triune God in our experience, not in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We do not have Him as a doctrinal concept but as an experiential enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are enjoying God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How good it is to enjoy the Father's calling, justifying, accepting, and caring for us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How wonderful it is to realize the Son's redeeming, saving, bringing us into the inheritance, and accomplishing of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How excellent it is to experience the Spirit's regenerating, disciplining, transforming, and causing us to grow and mature.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are not merely discussing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We are experiencing Him; we are participating in the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Triune God is with us experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the church life, we are Abrahams, Isaacs, and Jacobs including Josephs experiencing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We are enjoying the selection, predestination, calling, justification, acceptance, care, redemption, inheritance, accomplishment of God's purpose, regeneration, discipline, transformation, growth, maturity, and eventually the reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is the Triune God with the corporate called one.</S>
