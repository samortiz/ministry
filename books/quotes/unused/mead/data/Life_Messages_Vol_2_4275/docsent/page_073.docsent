   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY THE TRIUNE GOD SATURATING THE TRIPARTITE MAN Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2a, 9-10, 6b, 11 SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The relationship between God and man, as we have seen in the two previous messages, is a matter of life and of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both life and the spirit are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, according to the New Testament revelation, these two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said that the words He spoke "are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit is life, and life is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our human life and our human spirit are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When man was formed, God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life" Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word breath here is the same as the word for spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In both Hebrew and Greek, the word spirit may mean spirit, breath, or wind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In fact, in Ezekiel 37 the one Hebrew word is translated Spirit in verse 1 and wind and breath in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spirit, breath, and wind refer to three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the wind is weakened, it is the breath, and then becomes the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not enjoy the strong wind of a typhoon; we prefer the gentle breeze, which is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is our breath which keeps us alive; when our breathing stops, our life is over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Romans 8:2 the words spirit and life are brought together: "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life and spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The term, Spirit of life, indicates that the Spirit is the source, while life is the current or flow that comes from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Life is of the Spirit and issues from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit is the substance and the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we refer to the electric current, we are talking about the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is electricity when it is constant; it is an electric current when it is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Similarly, when the Spirit is activated, it becomes life; without movement it is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apart from an electric current, there is no electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The movement of the electricity is the current; the current is the very electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apart from the Spirit, there is no other life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When did the Spirit become activated and come into you as life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was when you confessed your sins, repented, and received the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was then that you were grafted to the Lord, and His Spirit flowed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within you He should be flowing all the time, as life to you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ACTIVATING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Electricity has been installed in this building, but if you do not turn on the switch, the function of the electricity will not be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want the heat, or the air-conditioning, or the lights, you must activate the electricity by turning on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then it will be hot, or cold, or bright.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With too many Christians today, the Spirit within is not activated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is the Spirit within you activated?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It may be moving when you are in a meeting, but how about when you are at dinner with your family?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How about when you are chatting with your friends?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How about when you are criticizing your daughter-in-law or your mother-in-law?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How about when you are gossiping?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How about when you are exchanging words with your spouse?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How much of the day is the Spirit in you switched on?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may love the Lord and seek Him, you may pay a price to follow Him, and you may even serve Him full time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the question still remains, How much of your time is the Spirit turned on?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we turn off the switch in the building, what is the use of talking about how dark it is in the room?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have asked me to have meetings with you about how to govern the church or how to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever I hear a question about "how to," my head whirls!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do not turn on the switch, what is the sense of studying how to make the lights shine or how to cool the building?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do not know how to touch the Spirit, it is a waste of time to talk about how to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The great problem throughout the whole world today is the energy source.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If this problem is not solved, it is useless to work on problems in transportation or industry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without sufficient energy, the other problems cannot be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As soon as you find the energy source, you will have light, heat, or air-conditioning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I heard that there was a young people's meeting arranged for me to speak at, I told the brothers, "No, let old and young both come."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have only one subject to talk about, whether to the young or the old: touch the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you are an unbeliever, I tell you, once you touch the Spirit by repenting, confessing, and asking the Lord to save you, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you have had fifty years of spiritual history, I tell you, touch the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are weary of turning on the switch and do not want to do it any more, you will be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every day you must turn on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you stop, you are about to die.</S>
