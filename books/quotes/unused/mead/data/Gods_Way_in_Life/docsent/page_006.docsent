   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD AS THE SPIRIT OF LIFE BECOMING OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This wonderful One lived on earth for over thirty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day, He suddenly told His disciples that He would go to Jerusalem to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the disciples heard this word, they were very disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They did not understand what the Lord meant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They thought that the Lord was going to die the One whom they loved and followed, the One who calmed the waves, healed the sick, and cast out the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To them, everything would be over if the Lord were to die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seemed that they did not hear the next word that the Lord spoke, that in three days He would rise up again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They knew what death was, but they had never heard of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, they did not at all understand what the Lord meant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the Lord revealed the matter to them three times already Matt 16:21-27; 17:22-23; 20:17-19 , they still did not grasp it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus is the Passover Lamb ordained by God John 1:29; 1 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was indeed crucified for us and died on the Jewish Passover day according to God's prophecy and the Old Testament type Matt 26:2; 27:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When He died and was buried, the disciples were greatly disappointed; they returned home in disenchantment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in a little over thirty hours, the news came that He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who heard it ran to the tomb and discovered that the stone was rolled away and the Lord's body was not there; only the linen cloths and the handkerchief that had been on His head still lay there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This proves that the Lord did not escape, nor was He stolen by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While they marveled, a messenger of the Lord came and told them that the Lord had resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this resurrection, He changed His form.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Formerly, He was God; by becoming flesh, He put on the form of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He was crucified and resurrected to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what is written in 1 Corinthians 15, that "the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'' v. 45 . Through becoming the life-giving Spirit, He is able to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus said: "I am the life.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He also said: "I have come that they may have life'' John 14:6; 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we receive Him as life, and how can He come into us?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When He was resurrected, He became the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By this, He is able to come into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the evening of the Lord's resurrection, the disciples were gathered together in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although they heard that the Lord had resurrected and they had believed, they did not see Him nor know where He was, and they were therefore very uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The door of the room where they were was closed for fear of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suddenly, the Lord appeared in their midst and said to them: "Peace be to you.''</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this, He showed them the marks of the nails in His hands and in His side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By that time, when the disciples saw that it was the Lord, they were glad, and their hearts were put at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then Jesus said, "As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.''</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After He spoke this word, He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit'' John 20:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Holy Spirit is the Holy Breath, who is also the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This time, the Lord did not come in that flesh that He had before; rather, He came with a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This body is real and touchable, and yet it can penetrate through closed doors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is something that our finite mind can never understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through death and resurrection, this Jesus Christ who was the embodiment of God became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As breath, He was breathed into the disciples as life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Holy Breath is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Triune God has been processed to be consummated as the completed Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Spirit is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this Spirit, there are many rich elements, including God, man, human living, the all-inclusive death, the mysterious resurrection, and the transcending ascension John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now, this Spirit has entered Peter, James, John, and all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, wherever the disciples are sent, He is always with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the Father sent the Son and came with Him, in the same way the Lord sends the disciples and goes with them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The disciples were overjoyed at the scene before them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To them it was too good to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But suddenly the Lord disappeared again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not go away; rather, He remained within the disciples, so that they could become accustomed to His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord appeared again to them many times.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those, however, were not His comings, but His appearings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He had never left the disciples, but was with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because of their weakness, He would sometimes manifest His presence to strengthen their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not long after this, due to his need for his livelihood, Peter brought a few brothers with him to fish by the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some of them were professional fishermen, and the sea was full of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moreover, nighttime is the best time to catch fish.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, they did not catch anything for the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This was truly a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Surely the Lord had commanded all the fish to stay away from the nets.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After this, the Lord appeared to them and gave them guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although that was not the good time to fish, they cast their net according to the Lord's word and caught many fish.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is, of course, a miracle too!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Surely the Lord had ordered the fish to swim into their net.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By this, the Lord recovered Peter back to His calling, and through this he experienced the Lord living in him as his life.</S>
