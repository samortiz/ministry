   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A year before I went to Nanking, I fellowshipped with Sister Lee concerning the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, since her attitude was very rigid and since she was not at all receptive, I made no further mention of it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later she read a book on church history, saw that the origin of the denominations was not scriptural, and became somewhat clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, I heard that she was baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later she and several other sisters began holding bread-breaking meetings every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I arrived in Nanking, naturally I attended the meeting to remember the Lord with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time Ruth Lee was invited to be the editor of The Spiritual Light, a leading spiritual magazine, published by the outstanding Christian writers of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She accepted the position, but through her contact with Watchman Nee, she received light concerning the proper way of the Lord's move and determined to turn to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She therefore presented her resignation as editor of The Spiritual Light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The chairman of its committee turned down her request and wished to keep her at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since she was a person with a deep sense of responsibility, she had no way at that time to carry out her desire to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1927 Nanking was occupied by the revolutionary army.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Several of the church buildings and the office of The Spiritual Light magazine were desolated by those who opposed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The magazine was terminated, and Ruth Lee was released under the Lord's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Huge Help</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being now free from her editorial responsibility, she traveled to Shanghai to meet with some sister co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same year Watchman Nee moved his gospel bookroom to Shanghai and asked Ruth to help him in the editorial work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She had an excellent command of the Chinese language, and from 1927 on, all of Watchman's writings were edited by her.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was a great help in his publication ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1933 he decided to publish Collection of Newsletters for communications and fellowship between the saints and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He asked Ruth to be his acting editor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She was a great help and saved much of his valuable time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1937, because of the Japanese invasion, the brothers and sisters were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time Watchman began to publish The Open Door magazine to facilitate the flow of information among the saints and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of his need to visit Europe, Ruth Lee was again asked to be his acting editor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her editorials provided much help to all the churches throughout China and the Southeast Asian countries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the years 1950 to 1952, Watchman Nee was desperately burdened to speed up the publication of messages from his 1948 and 1949 trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this task Ruth Lee was of immeasurable assistance to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through her help, most of those messages were published in book form before his imprisonment and have become a great heritage to the Lord's recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How we thank the Lord for this!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, Ruth Lee not only had a solid foundation in spiritual life and knowledge; she was also adequate in knowing and experiencing human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She was a very able person with deep insight coupled with a disciplined character.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She was able to supply much care not only to the sisters but also to the brothers, both in the churches and in the work.</S>
