   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN MINISTERING LIFE TO THE SINNING ONE Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:16-21 THE BASIC THOUGHTS IN FIRST JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When an author decides to compose a writing, he has some basic thoughts in mind as to what he plans to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that when the Apostle John wrote this Epistle, the basic matters which he wanted to share were the very items we have covered in our previous messages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was within him this matter of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Out of this life is the fellowship, the flowing of this life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Within John also must have been the fact of the mutual abiding, then the anointing, and then the spirit which has been reborn of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He wanted to remind his readers of the part within them which was not only created by God but also regenerated by His Spirit with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then there must also have been the thought of the seed of God, that is, God Himself sown into mankind as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is of these basic items that John composed this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE CONCLUDING ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With this message we come to the conclusion of 1 John, the last six verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the true God, and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Children, keep yourselves from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen" 1 John 5:16-21, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>. John's conclusion here is also composed of several basic matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are five on the negative side and three on the positive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The negative ones are: sin, death, the world, the wicked one, and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The positive ones are: God, the Son of God, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a help in studying the Bible to take note of the main items.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do not pick them out, you probably will not notice them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not hesitate to mark up your Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the important themes will stand out, and the light will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you circle the negative items in these verses in black, and then use another color to circle the positive items, your attention will be drawn to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>JOHN'S WAY OF WRITING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was the work of the Apostle John to mend the broken revelation which had been given to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He surely did a marvelous job!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even in these six verses we can see his wisdom and skillfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not sufficient for a carpenter to have good pieces of wood; he also needs skill if he is to shape them into fine furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In these verses John handled his words in a skillful way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Like the rest of the Bible, John's composition is not doctrinal but experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He begins his conclusion by speaking of a man seeing his brother sin and asking life for him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What John has in mind is not a doctrine but a case.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is speaking about experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no doctrinal flavor to these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are written from the standpoint of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible is surely not composed in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Systematic theology is a human invention.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The revelation in the Bible is not given in systematized doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Genesis begins by telling us, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Genesis 3 we have the account of the subtle serpent who came and beguiled the woman into partaking of the forbidden tree.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no doctrine of the Devil given.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament likewise begins in a way that is not doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It says, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Beware of doctrinal talk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The divisions in Christianity have come about largely over doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If Christians cared more for experience and less for doctrine, there would not be so many divisions.</S>
