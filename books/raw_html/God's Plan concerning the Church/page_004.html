        <h2 class="head1">BEING ETERNAL</h2>
<p>In eternity God&rsquo;s plan was concerning the church. Before the creation of the universe and all things, before time began, that is, in eternity without beginning, this plan was in God. Ephesians 3:9 says, &ldquo;The economy...which throughout the ages has been hidden in God.&rdquo; The phrase <em>throughout the ages</em> means &ldquo;from eternity.&rdquo; Hence, this economy, this plan, is an eternal plan.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan was made in eternity and also for eternity. The plan was made in eternity, and the purpose of the plan is for eternity. From God&rsquo;s perspective, there is only eternity. From our perspective, there is eternity past and eternity future. So from our perspective, God made this plan in eternity past for eternity future. In other words, in eternity past God had a &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; of the church. This can be compared to a blueprint for building a house. In time God is building the church according to His blueprint. When His building work is finished in eternity future, God&rsquo;s building will be manifested. This building is the New Jerusalem as the ultimate and fullest manifestation of the church.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish His eternal plan in time concerning the church, God worked in two steps. The first step of God&rsquo;s work involves creation, and the second step involves redemption. Creation calls things not being as being, but redemption gives life to the dead. According to its precise definition, redemption does not give life to the dead. However, the focus of God&rsquo;s redemption is to give life to the dead. What God created through His calling things not being as being is the first creation. What God made through giving life to the dead is the new creation. The first creation was corrupted by Satan and became the evil and defiled old creation. The new creation is the issue of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming death and His resurrection. The old creation is in Adam, but the new creation is in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). The old creation in the fallen Adam is soulish, natural; the new creation in the resurrected Christ is spiritual (1 Cor. 15:46-48).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s building will be completed when what is soulish and natural becomes spiritual. The so-called old heaven and old earth are part of the old creation. The new heaven and new earth are part of the new creation. The new heaven and new earth come when the entire old creation becomes new (Rev. 21:1). The New Jerusalem, the eternal building that God planned to build and to accomplish in eternity, will be the center of the new creation (v. 24).</p>
<p>Materials need to be prepared for God&rsquo;s plan, and a building must be built. The building can take place only after the materials are prepared. God&rsquo;s creation by calling things not being as being is for His preparation of the materials. God&rsquo;s redemption and His giving life to the dead are for the building of these materials. Therefore, in time God is manifested first as the God of creation and then as the God of resurrection. Romans 4:17 says that Abraham believed in the God &ldquo;who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s calling things not being as being is His preparation of materials for His eternal plan, but His giving life to the dead is for His building of these materials to accomplish His eternal plan.</p>
<p>We were created by God; hence, we are the materials for God to build the church. However, when there is only the element of creation without the element of resurrection, there are only materials but no building. The materials must pass through death and resurrection in order for there to be God&rsquo;s building. Therefore, our being built by God depends on our experience of death and resurrection. The extent to which we experience death and resurrection is the extent to which we are built by God. Without passing through death and resurrection, we are natural materials that cannot be built into the church. In order for us to be built into the church, we must pass through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>A descendant of Adam is created by God, but he is not a member of the church; he is only a piece of material. He can become a member of the church when he passes through redemption, that is, through death and resurrection. Furthermore, a person may be saved, but he may still have many natural things in him that are of Adam and that have not passed through death and resurrection. In other words, he is raw material that has not yet been built. However, the more he experiences the cross, knows resurrection, and allows God&rsquo;s work of death and resurrection to gain ground in him, the more he is built into the church. This is the way for a believer to be built by God into the church.</p>
<p>In eternity past God had a blueprint of the church. In eternity future God will gain a building that is completed according to His blueprint. In time God first created, and then He accomplished death and resurrection; that is, He first prepared materials and then began building. When He is finished building, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will be manifested in eternity future (Rev. 21&mdash;22). Hence, God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church existed in eternity past and is for eternity future.</p>

            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
