   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONSECRATE THEMSELVES VOLUNTARILY TO BE AN ANTI-TESTIMONY IN THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, while I was considering before the Lord what to share, I had a strong feeling within that I should let the young people realize the importance of turning the age, and should show the young brothers and sisters the kind of persons God uses to turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This kind of people are those who consecrate themselves voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While everyone else is going downward, a few persons are standing as an anti-testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The whole book of Daniel was an anti-testimony against that age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of the others were eating the king s meat and drinking the king s wine, but these four were not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of the others worshipped idols, but these three would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The others had stopped praying because of the king s decree, but Daniel still prayed three times a day toward Jerusalem on his knees before God!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the anti-testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brothers and sisters, let me say it again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What kind of persons can be used by God to withstand the age?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are the voluntarily consecrated ones!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can see this basic principle in both Samuel and Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must say, "I cannot do the things that the world does.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I cannot take the way that the world takes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The world may follow the tide of this age, but I cannot follow it."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Young people, you must realize that God's testimony, including the authority and glory, has been destroyed in the tide of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone who is used by God to turn the age must be one who consecrates himself voluntarily in the midst of this tide.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He can stand up and declare to everyone, "I cannot follow this tide.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will be one who stands against the tide."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do this, God's authority and God's glory will be expressed through you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we read the book of Daniel, we will realize that God's authority and God's glory were both with Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Daniel truly became God's throne and God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Daniel we see God's ruling and God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even the idol-worshipping Gentiles saw God's glory and ruling in Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No wonder that through this one person, Daniel, God was eventually able to bring the Israelites back to Jerusalem and to recover His authority and His temple among them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That turning point was totally because of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was able to be such a one because he was a voluntarily consecrated one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was willing to stand against the tide and be a testimony for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was a young man who could be used by God to turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May God raise up young men like Daniel for the need of this age!</S>
