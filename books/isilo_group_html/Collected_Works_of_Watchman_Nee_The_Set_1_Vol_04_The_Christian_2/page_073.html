"To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it."</P><P>We should pay special attention to the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Pergamos. We have seen that the condition in Pergamos is not merely an ancient event but the current condition. Not only are the teachings and warnings of this letter related to us, even its promises directly affect us. Actually, it should affect us more today than in those days because we are living in the age when the sinful teachings of those days are ripening, maturing, and increasing.</P><P>Although the condition of the church as revealed in this letter is most corrupt and gloomy, the promise it contains is full of life and light. When circumstances are particularly trying, the overcomers will have particular rewards. According to the preordained course, if we want to gain our possession, we must pass through sufferings, trials, and battles. The Lord's word here is for the comfort and encouragement of those who are still on the way. But the distant view unfolded in these words seems to take one beyond the battlefield into the possession of one's hope already! This promise is divided into two parts. First is the manna, which typifies Christ. It shows how the believers long after Christ. Second is the white stone, which typifies the Christian. It shows how the Lord longs after the Christian. This exchange of love is most touching! All those who trust in the Lord, who honor His name and would not deny this name, will be rewarded according to their faithfulness.</P><P>Before we go on to the spiritual significance, we first have to mention one important point. We have to realize that this promise was meant to be literal. Although there are spiritual meanings to the Lord's promises, we should not consider the spiritual significance first and ignore the literal facts. In the interpretation of God's word, we should know that other than the parables, the prophetic symbols, and the signs, everything should be expounded literally. However, this does not mean that we should annul all spiritual meanings. We should not annul the literal meanings by the spiritual meanings. One should first expound literally, then spiritually. By this, the word of God will be made rich. As to the first half of this promise, we know that there were people who had eaten manna before. Hence, it is not impossible for man to eat manna again in the future. In the future, we will have a resurrected body. We will be like the Lord Jesus, being able to eat and drink as before. The manna was the people's food in the wilderness. Yet the hidden manna promised by the Lord is not for every believer but for the overcoming ones among all the believers. Let us consider the second half of the promise. What is the white stone? We know that the manna and the white stone are both objects taken from the Aaronic priesthood. As Pharaoh of old gave Joseph a new name and a ring, in the same way Christ will give to His overcomers a new name and a white stone. This name is now kept secret. Only the overcomers will know the secret of this heavenly name, and only the overcomers will inherit this name. As the name of Antipas was unknown to man, in the same way, the name of the overcomers will be unknown to the world.</P><P>We believe that in the future there will be literal manna to feed our resurrected bodies. We also believe that in the future we will receive an actual precious white stone. This is the literal side of these words. However, besides the literal meanings, there are still many profound spiritual meanings. Now we want to consider the spiritual side of these words.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 73</div><br></body></html>
