<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF LIVING BY FAITH</h2>
<p>Formerly, almost no one among the believers in China lived by faith before God. Sister Dora Yu had this experience to some extent, but there was not a solid testimony of living by faith until we were raised up. In the past, people first agreed upon a salary and then began to serve the Lord. We saw this problem with many people. In Harbin, a congregation was recently raised up; they offered to hire Pastor Ting Li-mei for two hundred silver dollars a month. However, Ting Li-mei would not agree to it. My sister graduated from a theological seminary, and in her letters to the family she used to tell us which places paid more and which places paid less. At that time, the matter of living by faith had not been recovered.</p>
<p>When the Lord raised us up in China, the brothers were an anti-testimony. They said that the servants of God should live by trusting in God. In the beginning it was very difficult for the brothers and sisters. The beginning of anything is not easy, but the brothers fought the good fight. Whenever I heard their testimonies, I felt that God was working in them. Regrettably, some people soon damaged this matter. Some spiritually gifted persons began to travel to preach the Word, receiving support from many places. May the Lord have mercy on us not to take this way; it is wrong to take a salary from a church organization, and it is wrong to take money for itinerant preaching, taking advantage of a spiritual gift. For example, some traveling preachers have a special announcement at the beginning and end of every meeting that there will be a collection for the speaker. This kind of situation existed here in Taipei just a few years ago. This is a deformed practice of living by faith.</p>
<p>Some people have asked why we do not go out more often to hold conferences, because if we held more conferences, we would probably get more money. We cannot hold conferences if it seems that we are holding them just for money. We are pitiful people without faith, but because the Lord has had mercy on us, there are some kinds of support that we can receive and some that we cannot. This is especially true for the young brothers and sisters; if they do not take care of monetary matters properly, it is better for them to take jobs instead of serving the Lord full time.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Manila, I stayed there for five and a half months, and before I returned to Taiwan, the elders in Manila discussed the needs of Taiwan behind my back. I knew about it; they discussed it in the elders&rsquo; meeting on at least two occasions. I solemnly beseeched the brothers not to make any announcements to the saints. The Lord does not send us out to ask for money; that kind of thing is low and despicable. We are forced by the environment to speak such foolish things. The recovery of living by faith is the seventh recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF FELLOWSHIP IN MUTUAL LOVE</h2>
<p>Many among us were members in a denomination; therefore, we are aware of the general situation in Christianity. In 1922 a few brothers were raised up, and they began to love one another and have fellowship with one another. They had the condition of Philadelphia to a much greater degree than we have it today. However, thank the Lord that the mutual love is still here today. This, too, is one of the important early recoveries among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF BEING CALLED</h2>
<p>Before we were raised up by the Lord, being a preacher was considered a profession; it did not matter if a person had been called by God. I know of a mother who educated her brightest child in medicine, her second-brightest child in business, and consecrated her least intelligent child to the church to study theology. This is the human concept. I had an irresponsible classmate who began working in the news media but was not very successful. Less than six months after I was saved, he came to me one day and said, &ldquo;I heard that you have believed in Jesus and that you are very zealous. Could you give me an introduction to your church? I would like to go to your church and be a preacher.&rdquo; These two examples show that most people have the impression that being a preacher is low and base.</p>
<p>When Western missionaries came to China they had a difficult time finding proper helpers. Preachers had such a low status that many of them were false and were not raised up by God. Only when we were raised up in China was the matter of being called by the Lord recovered. We saw that being a servant of the Lord is a matter of being called. When someone is called by God, God commissions that person to do His work. The truth that all the saints should serve God and that all the believers are priests has been recovered. The matter of being called, however, applies to those who work solely for God. If a person has not been called, he should remain at his job.</p>
