   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST IS THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9; John 1:4; 10:10b; 7:37-39; 6:63; 1 John 1:2; 5:11-12; Col 3:4; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 21:6c; 22:1-2, 17; 7:17 SEEKING FIRST HIS KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we continue with the matter of Christ as the meaning of human life, let us review some of the points covered in the preceding chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that man as the meaning of the universe is the expression of God and the representative of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have two wonderful words for these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the first point the wonderful word is image.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The wonderful word for the second point is dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Gospel of Matthew, which is the book of the kingdom, we have the term kingdom the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom of the heavens simply equals the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, kingdom and dominion refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When man became fallen, he was fallen from the dominion, the kingdom, of God, not from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So man has to return to God's dominion, not to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Dominion is an Old Testament term used in the first book of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the first book of the New Testament, the term used is kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Repent, for the kingdom..has drawn near" Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to realize that you are fallen from the dominion, the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now you need to turn back to the dominion, the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not let your thoughts be so much on the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unfortunately, Christianity preaches too much on the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But John the Baptist did not say, "Repent, for heaven has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Go back home to heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, he told people to repent for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kingdom is the dominion from which you were fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now you need to return to the very sphere from which you were fallen, that is, the kingdom, the dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in the book of Matthew we also have the phrase the righteousness of God, which equals the image of God in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To have the righteousness of God does not mean merely to be right with God but to be right according to what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be right with God is one thing, and to be right according to God is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The religious people stress the matter of being right with God but often neglect the matter of being right according to what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So what is the difference between these two things?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me give you a little illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter received the revelation of Christ as the Son of the living God Matt 16:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He also saw the vision of the transfigured, glorified Jesus 17:1-5 and even had the experience of the outpoured Spirit on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:1-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet in Acts 10 Peter was so religious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He went up on the housetop to keep his prayer time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While he was praying, a trance came upon him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In his trance he saw a vision: "A certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners onto the earth, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These animals or beasts were considered common and unclean by the Jews according to the Old Testament ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But a voice came to Peter, saying, "Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!" v. 13 . But what did Peter say? He said, "By no means, Lord" v. 14 .</S>
