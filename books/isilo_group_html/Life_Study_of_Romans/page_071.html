The Spirit of Sonship</h2><p>&ldquo;For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.&rdquo; How did we receive this spirit of sonship? By the Spirit of the Son of God coming into our spirit. Galatians 4:6, a sister verse to Romans 8:15, says, &ldquo;And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.&rdquo; Romans 8:15 says that we &ldquo;have received a spirit of sonship&rdquo;; Galatians 4:6 says that &ldquo;God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son&rdquo; into us. Because the Spirit of the Son of God enters into our spirit our spirit becomes a spirit of sonship. Thus, verse 15 says that we &ldquo;have received a spirit of sonship.&rdquo; Furthermore, verse 15 mentions &ldquo;a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father&rdquo;; but in Galatians 4:6 it says that &ldquo;the Spirit of His Son&rdquo; cries &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; There is a difference here. Nevertheless, whether we cry or He cries, we both cry together. When we cry, He cries in our crying. When He cries, we cry with Him. According to grammar, the subject of crying in verse 15 is &ldquo;we,&rdquo; but in Galatians 4:6 the subject of crying is &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; These two verses prove that we and He, our spirit and the Spirit, are one. When we cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; He joins with us in our crying. The Spirit cries in our crying because the Spirit of the Son of God indwells our spirit. Hence, there is no fear, only a sweet crying of, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Abba&rdquo; is an Aramaic word which also means father. When these two terms &ldquo;Abba&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father&rdquo; are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate. &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; is sweetness intensified. Children of every race address their father in such a sweet way: in America we say, &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo;; in China they say, &ldquo;Baba&rdquo;; and in the Philippines they say, &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; We do not speak one syllable, such as &ldquo;Da,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ba,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pa.&rdquo; It is not sweet at all if we speak just one syllable. We need to say, &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Baba,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; We need to call, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; If you do it, you will realize how sweet it is.</p><p>Why do we call, &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo;? Because we have a spirit of sonship. If a certain man is not my father, it will be difficult for me to call him &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo; It may be easy for me to call him &ldquo;mister,&rdquo; but I cannot call him &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo; It would be even harder for me to say to him, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; In fact, it would be impossible. If my dear father were still living, I would like to call him, &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo; It would be so sweet to address him in this way because I was born of him. Young people, there is no need for you to doubt whether or not you are the sons of God. When you say, &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; do you have a sweet, intimate sensation within you? If you do, it proves that you are a son of God and that you have a spirit of sonship. If you find yourself able to call Him God, but not Abba Father, it indicates that you are not a son of God. However, as long as you can call, &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; sweetly, you may be assured that you are a son of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Witnessing of the Spirit</h2><p>&ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; In verse 14 we see &ldquo;the sons of God&rdquo; and in verse 15 &ldquo;the spirit of sonship.&rdquo; Why in verse 16 does Paul suddenly mention &ldquo;the children&rdquo;? Because the Spirit witnesses to something basic. He witnesses to our primary or initial relationship with God. As I have already mentioned, we may be children without the growth of a son and we may be sons without the qualification of an heir. For the Holy Spirit to witness that we are all heirs of God would be premature. Most of us are not mature enough for such a witness. Thus, the Spirit witnesses to the most basic and elementary relationship&mdash;that of being the children of God. He witnesses with our spirit that we are God&rsquo;s children. Therefore, the witnessing of the Holy Spirit starts with the youngest age, even from our spiritual birth. Regardless of how young or new you may be, if you are a child of God, the Spirit of God witnesses with your spirit. Notice that it does not say &ldquo;in our spirit.&rdquo; If it said &ldquo;in our spirit,&rdquo; it would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses, but that our spirit does not witness. However, it says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, meaning that both witness together. The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him. This is wonderful.</p><p>Some may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that the Spirit of God witnesses. Where is the Spirit of God? I don&rsquo;t feel Him. I don&rsquo;t have any sensation that the Spirit of God is within me. I never saw Him and I cannot feel Him. I simply cannot sense Him.&rdquo; However, do you not feel that your spirit witnesses? You must realize that as long as your spirit is witnessing it means that the Holy Spirit also is witnessing. You cannot deny that your spirit witnesses within you. The Apostle Paul was very wise. He said that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, because the two spirits have been mingled together as one. It is very difficult for anyone to distinguish these two spirits.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Romans &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
