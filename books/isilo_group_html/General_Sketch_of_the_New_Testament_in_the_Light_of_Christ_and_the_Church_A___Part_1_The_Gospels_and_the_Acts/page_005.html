We ourselves must preach this gospel of the kingdom (Matt 24:14). The gospel of the kingdom requires human beings to receive God as life to fulfill His kingdom requirements with authority to subdue all God&#8217;s enemies and with glory to express Him. It is impossible for our natural human life to subdue God&#8217;s enemies and glorify God in a full way. To do good is the most that our created life can do. If, on the negative side, we are to subdue all God&#8217;s enemies and, on the positive side, glorify God in a full way, we must have God Himself in us as our life. This is the extract of the teaching of the entire New Testament.<p>If we consider the four Gospels and the Acts, we will realize that the gospel preached by John the Baptist, by Christ Himself, by the disciples sent by Christ, and by the apostles after the day of Pentecost was the gospel of the kingdom, which brings people into God&#8217;s kingdom with His authority to overcome all His enemies and express Him in His full glory (Matt. 3:2; 4:17, 23; 9:35; 10:7; Acts 8:12; 19:8). This gospel, which was preached by John the Baptist, by Christ, by the disciples, and by the apostles, must also be announced by us (Matt. 24:14). However, most Christians today preach a low gospel, telling others, &#8220;You have no peace or joy, and you will perish in hell, but God loves you and has been merciful to you. Now you must believe in Him to have peace and joy and to go to heaven.&#8221; This is today&#8217;s poor, low gospel, a gospel without any glory. However, the gospel preached by John the Baptist, Christ, His disciples, and His apostles was full of glory and authority. It is a gospel of God Himself as our life within for us to subdue, conquer, and overcome all God&#8217;s enemies and express God in His full glory. This is the gospel of the kingdom, which is the second main item, the second thought, of the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>THE FALLEN CONDITION OF MAN</h2><p>The third matter that the New Testament unveils in the four Gospels is the real condition of man. When God was incarnated as a man and brought His kingdom to man, man was in a poor condition. Every case in the four Gospels reveals the condition of man. Man is sinful, full of lusts, sickness, weakness, and death, and he is filled with evil spirits, possessed by demons, and ruled over by Satan in his kingdom of darkness (John 8:7, 11, 21; Matt. 14:14; 15:30-31; Luke 7:12; John 11:11-14; Matt. 8:16; 12:22-28).<p>Wherever the Lord Jesus went in His ministry on the earth, He encountered sin, sickness, weakness, death, sinful things, demon-possession, evil spirits, and the rule of the darkness of Satan. Furthermore, the condition of mankind is also one of hunger, thirst, dissatisfaction, and disappointment (Matt. 14:14-21; John 7:37). Therefore, the four Gospels show us a full picture, not only of the incarnated God with His kingdom, but of man&#8217;s fallen condition. Many pages in the four Gospels reveal the real condition of man as the third item, a negative item, of the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST MEETING MAN&#8217;S EVERY NEED</h2><p>The fourth thing that the New Testament reveals to us is that this very Christ meets all of mankind&#8217;s needs. He is the full answer to all our needs. The first four books of the New Testament testify that whatever man needs, Christ is. If we need life, He is life (John 10:10b). If we need light, He is light (8:12). If we are sick, He is the Healer (Matt. 8:14-16). If we are weak, He is the strength (John 5:8-9). What do you need? If you need redemption, He is also redemption; if you need regeneration, you have it in Christ. Those who were blind came to Him and received sight (Mark 10:46-52; John 9:4-13). The dead were resurrected by Him (John 11:41-44). Those who were sick met Him and were healed (Luke 4:38-40). He filled the hungry ones, satisfied the thirsty ones, and released the demon-possessed ones (John 6:32-35; 7:37; Mark 1:23-28; 5:1-20). There is not one case in these books of a man who had a need that Christ could not meet. Rather, these books show us that Christ is the very answer to all the needs of mankind. This is the fourth item that the New Testament reveals. If we keep these principles in mind when we read the New Testament, we will understand it in a better way.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 1: The Gospels and the Acts &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
