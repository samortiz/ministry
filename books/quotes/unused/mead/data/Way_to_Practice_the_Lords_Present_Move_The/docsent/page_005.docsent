   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S BLESSING ON HIS RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would also like to relate something of our recent experience in Taiwan which shows how the Lord s blessing is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In October of 1984 I went to Taipei and I was led by the Lord to carry out and finish three risks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, fifty-two elders were established overnight in Taipei and twenty-eight more were added later.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Approximately ninety percent of these elders are under forty years of age, and some are a little over thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, we realized that we had been on the island of Taiwan for over thirty-six years and we had still not evangelized the entire island.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result we made a decision to rise up and evangelize, gospelize, and truthize the entire island of Taiwan within five years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are calling for five hundred full-timers every year for the next five years, giving us up to twenty-five hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a big risk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Third, I proposed that for the Lord s move for evangelizing Taiwan, we needed a large center for training.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We acquired thirty-seven and a half acres on which to build this center, which cost about eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After making the decision to purchase this property, we made an announcement to the twenty-one halls of the church in Taipei concerning the need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the Lord s day nearly the entire amount of cash came in to purchase the property from each offering box in the twenty-one halls.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one knows who offered how much, but the land was paid off mostly by one Lord s day offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, about two hundred and fifty full-timers were raised up on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since approximately one hundred and thirty of these full-timers were raised up in Taipei in 1985, over five thousand have been baptized in the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In December of 1985 we had two big gospel meetings in a stadium in Taipei that can seat twelve thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To my surprise, this stadium was filled over its seating capacity with fourteen thousand people for the first gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There were at least seven thousand newcomers there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I sounded the call at the end of the meeting for the unsaved ones to receive the Lord, approximately fifteen hundred to two thousand people came forward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Again, this is the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the last two meetings of the 1985 winter training in Irving, Texas, I fellowshipped about the matter of going full-time, and one hundred ninety-eight responded to the call to be full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again, we can see the Lord s blessing on His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The present need of the world and of all the Lord s children is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are those who have the truth concerning this processed and consummated God, and we are experiencing the Lord s blessing wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OUR RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we must see what our responsibility is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need to do one thing go!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament, there are two small words that are great in their spiritual significance come and go.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 11:28 the Lord tells all who labor and are burdened to come to Me...and I will give you rest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, there is a call for the thirsty sinner to come and drink the water of life 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the Lord had stayed with His disciples for three and a half years, He took the lead to go through His death and resurrection .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They did not know that the Lord s going was His real coming to them John 14:2-3; cf. vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>18, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He took the lead to go and He came back in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord told the disciples, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord did not say to go to disciple the nations and baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said go to disciple the nations, baptizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Discipling includes baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We disciple others by baptizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have heard Christians debating as to where people were to be baptized, how people should be baptized, and what kind of water people should be baptized in. But I hardly ever heard a stress on baptizing people into the name, that is, into the Person, of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord charged us to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our Profession The Divine Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some may feel that if we mean business with the Lord to go, this means to be full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All of the believers are God s priests and our profession is the divine priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever a priest does is to God s service.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may need to make a living, but this does not mean that we do not go.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Acts 8:1 tells us that a great persecution fell upon all the saints in Jerusalem, and all of them were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria except the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thousands of believers left Jerusalem and carried out the spreading of the gospel Acts 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Were these ones who were scattered full-timers?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In a sense they were and in another sense they were not.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No doubt, some of them still had jobs, but they all went.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They all were the goers to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without that persecution, they probably would not have gone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The persecution kept them from remaining in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord s word in Acts 1:8 that the believers were to be His witnesses first in Jerusalem, then in Judea, and then in Samaria was fulfilled through that great persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When that great persecution came, thousands of believers were sovereignly sent to spread the gospel.</S>
