When He was lifted up on the cross, He was the Lamb (1:29), but He was in the form of a serpent. In John 1 is the Lamb, and in John 3 is the serpent. He was lifted up on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away our sin, and He was lifted up in the form of the serpent to deal with Satan, the old serpent, so that we might have the divine, eternal life (v. 15).</P><P>Surely His being lifted up was also to accomplish redemption, but redemption is not the goal. Redemption is the procedure for the goal. Redemption is for life. Through redemption we receive life. Praise the Lord that today we are not only redeemed but also born again. The past is gone and a new life is now our portion. We have the eternal life, which is God Himself flowing into us. Life is simply God Himself in Christ as the Spirit flowing into us.</P><P>God has flowed Himself out and into us by two steps&#151;by incarnation and by resurrection. Incarnation accomplished redemption, and resurrection imparts life into us. It was by the step of incarnation that He became a man (John 1:14). As a man He was the Lamb of God lifted up on the cross in the form of a serpent to take away sin and to deal with Satan in His accomplishment of redemption. Then He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Christ as the Lamb of God is in chapter one of John. Christ as the breath, as the life-giving Spirit, is in chapter twenty. After He was resurrected, He came back to His disciples and breathed into them, telling them to receive the Holy Spirit (v. 22). When we believed into Him, we received Him by breathing Him in. Now we have Him within us as our life.</P><P>Eventually, in John 3:29 Christ is revealed as the Bridegroom who is for the bride. We are the bride. We might wonder how we fallen sinners could be a part of Christ's glorious bride. We become a part of this glorious bride by redemption and regeneration. John 3 shows us the start of life and the consequence of life. The start of life is to be regenerated by receiving redemption. The consequence of life is to enter into the kingdom and become a part of the bride. By being redeemed and regenerated we have entered into the kingdom of God and have become a part of the bride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANSFORMATION BY DRINKING CHRIST, FEEDING<br>ON HIM, ABIDING IN HIM, AND BREATHING HIM IN</H2><P>After being regenerated, we need transformation. We can be transformed by drinking Christ, feeding on Him, abiding in Him, and breathing Him in all the time. John chapter four tells us how to drink of Him. Chapter six tells us how to feed on Him. Then chapters fourteen and fifteen tell us how to abide in Him. Finally, chapter twenty tells us how to breathe Him in. As we breathe Him in, we are refreshed. Christ is the real refreshment. We need to be refreshed by Christ day by day. By drinking, eating, abiding, and breathing, we grow in the divine life. If you are really drinking of Christ, feeding upon Him, abiding in Him, and breathing Him in day by day, you will have the growth.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
