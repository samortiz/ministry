in the Triune God through Sanctification<br />
by the Reality of the Word</h2>
<p>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the word (John 17:14-21). In the portion of His prayer in verses 14-21, the Lord referred to the word and to the truth. The word sanctifies, and the truth sanctifies. Thus, the word and the truth are one. The word contains and bears the truth. This word, which is the truth, sanctifies God&rsquo;s redeemed people from the world (v. 17) and keeps them from the ruler of the world, the evil one (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">In the Triune God</h2>
<p>In John 17:21 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&rdquo; The word <em>Us</em> here refers to the Triune God. This shows that the oneness of the believers is in the Triune God, which means that the believers are mingled with the processed Triune God. The believers could not be one without being mingled with the Triune God. Hence, the Triune God is the very base and element of our oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Through Sanctification<br />
by the Reality of the Word</h2>
<p>Before being saved, we were in the world and were mixed with the world. To be in the Triune God as our oneness, we need to be sanctified, that is, we need to be separated from being mixed with the world. If we would practice the genuine oneness, we must realize that the world must go. We cannot be mingled with the Triune God and at the same time remain in a mixture with the world. Therefore, we must be separated from being mixed with the world, so that we can be holy unto the Triune God to have a pure mingling with Him. This pure mingling is the oneness. If we desire to realize the genuine oneness, we must be separated from the mixing world unto the sanctifying God through the reality of His sanctifying word.</p>
<p>In addition to being separated from the world, we need to be kept from the evil one (v. 15). When we were mixed with the world, we were captured by the evil one. Thus, we need to be sanctified from the world and to be kept from the evil one unto the Triune God. Then we will be freed and purified to be mingled with the Triune God, that is, to practice the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Through the Reality of the Word</h2>
<p>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is through the reality of the word, that is, through the reality of the processed Triune God conveyed in His sanctifying word (John 17:17). Without the Triune God as the content, the word would be empty. The New Testament shows us clearly that the truth, the word, and the Triune God are one. The word is the truth (v. 17), and the truth is the Triune God (John 14:6; 1 John 5:6b). Hence, the word that is the reality contains the Triune God as its content. To be sanctified by the reality of the word is to be sanctified by the Triune God Himself. The Triune God is the very content of the sanctification. By this we can realize what the nature of this genuine oneness is.</p>
<p>The genuine oneness, which is the mingling of the Triune God with the redeemed humanity, has three aspects. The first aspect is the oneness in the Father&rsquo;s name by His divine life, and the second is the oneness in the Triune God by His sanctifying word. The first aspect concerns the source and the element of the oneness, and the second concerns the standing of the oneness. If we are in the world and under Satan&rsquo;s hand, we cannot practice the oneness. To practice the oneness, we must be separated from the world and kept away from Satan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br />
in the Divine Glory for the Expression<br />
of the Processed and Mingled Triune God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In the Divine Glory</h2>
<p>The third aspect of the genuine oneness is the oneness of the believers in Christ in the divine glory (John 17:22-24). After many years of studying the New Testament, we have found out that God&rsquo;s glory is His divine life with His divine nature to express Him. If we did not have the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature, it would be impossible for us to express the Father. The expression of the Father comes from the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature. This expression of the Father is the glory.</p>
<p>First, the Father gave this glory to the Son that the Son may have the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature to express the Father. Then the Son gave the same glory to His believers. This means that the Son has given the divine life with the divine nature to His believers that they may express God. It is in this expression that we are one. The oneness of all the believers in the divine glory is the oneness in the expressed sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and nature. If we live by our life with our nature to express ourselves, there will be no glory of God. In the expression of ourselves there is no oneness; rather, there is division.</p>
<p>In the second aspect of oneness, we must be sanctified from the world and kept from Satan. In the third aspect, we must be saved from ourself, we must lose ourself. We must not act or do anything to express ourself; rather, we must do things in the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature to express the Father. This is glory, and it is in this glory that we all are one.</p>
<p>Even in a small town where only fifteen saints are meeting as the church, if these fifteen do not behave, act, and do things in the divine life with the divine nature to express God, they will have opinions and will surely be divided. However, if they would be willing to be saved from themselves, willing not to live in their natural life with their own nature to express themselves, but to live the divine life with the divine nature to carry out the divine expression, spontaneously, among those fifteen there would be a genuine oneness, and this oneness would swallow up all their opinions.</p>
<h2 class="head3">For the Expression of the Processed<br />
and Mingled Triune God</h2>
<p>This oneness is to express in His fullness the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God, who has mingled Himself with the believers in their humanity. The oneness in the divine glory is to express the whole and entire incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God in all His fullness, that is, in all His riches. This rich God has mingled Himself with the human believers for His corporate, all-inclusive expression. Such an expression is a mingling of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God with all His redeemed in their humanity. This is to be one in the glory of the Divine Trinity.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
