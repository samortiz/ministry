Where is Jesus today? He is not in the camp; He has been rejected by the camp and cast out of it. Remember well that the camp is the religious organization of the present day. At the time of Moses, the camp was the people of Israel. Then at the time of the Lord Jesus, the camp was the organized Jewish religion. At the time of Martin Luther, the Roman Catholic Church had become the camp. From Luther&#8217;s biography we can realize that he entered within the veil to enjoy the heavenly Christ to be empowered so that he would have the strength and power to suffer the persecution of that camp, and he went out of that camp to follow Jesus, bearing the reproach and suffering the persecution. Years later John Bunyan, the author of The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, went outside the camp of the state church of England. Today this camp is the organization of Christianity. In the eyes of God organized Christianity is simply a camp. In name it is the Lord&#8217;s people, but in actuality it is full of corruption and even idol worship. There is almost no place, no ground, for the Lord, and the presence of the Lord has been cast out. If we mean business to enjoy the presence of the Lord in the heavens within the veil, we must go outside the camp of organized Christianity to follow Jesus.<p>Today many Christians are like the Hebrew believers. On the one hand, they try to enjoy the heavenly Christ in their spirit, but on the other hand, they compromise with organized Christianity and try to remain there. They do not want to go outside the camp to bear His reproach. According to this clear picture, we can see where we should be. Our spirit must be in the heavens with Christ, and our steps must be with Jesus outside the camp of organized Christianity. However, many dear Christians cannot say boldly that their steps are outside the camp of organized religion to follow Jesus.<h2 class=head2>Within the Veil and Outside the Camp</h2><p>I truly appreciate these two phrases in the book of Hebrews: within the veil and outside the camp (6:19; 13:13). Christ is our offering, our portion offered to God for us on the altar of the cross. The way to enjoy Him as our portion is twofold. On the one hand, we enjoy the ascended Christ in the heavens in our spirit, while on the other hand, we need to follow His steps outside the camp and bear His reproach. In these two ways we fully enjoy Him as our portion. The way to enjoy Him is by entering the veil and going outside the camp. To enter the veil is to enjoy the heavenly Christ in our spirit, and to go outside the camp is to give up the organized religion to follow Jesus. There is no other way to fully enjoy Him. The more we enjoy Him as the heavenly Melchisedec in our spirit, the more we will step outside the camp and give up organized Christianity.<p>By enjoying and experiencing Christ in our spirit, we spontaneously step out of organized Christianity. We may say that we do not have the strength to bear His reproach and suffer. However, the strength is not of us; the strength is of Him. The more we go to Him to enjoy Him in the heavens by contacting Him in our spirit, the more we have the strength to step out of organized Christianity, following Jesus on this earth and bearing His reproach. It is not by our strength but by Christ as our strength.<p>It is not sufficient merely to encourage you to step out of organized Christianity, but if you contact the heavenly Christ in your spirit and enjoy Him, you will spontaneously walk out of that great &#8220;tree&#8221; (Matt. 13:32). Spontaneously and unconsciously you will be outside the gate. Even if you do not want to walk out, the people there may cast you out. I left organized religion in 1927. Some people were ready to cast me out, saying, &#8220;Mr. Lee, you better go somewhere else. You are too much trouble to us!&#8221;<p>The more we contact the heavenly Christ, the more we may be considered a &#8220;pest&#8221; by the people in organized religion (Acts 24:5). When we are cast out, we suffer and bear the reproach. Today I can say that I am one of many who are within the veil enjoying the heavenly Christ and outside the camp bearing the reproach of Jesus. This is the only way for us to follow Him and enjoy Him as our portion. This is the way of faith, the way of the cross, which is the narrow pathway for us to enjoy Christ in a practical way. May the Lord be gracious to us that we may practice this.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
