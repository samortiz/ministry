   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Life is exceedingly complex.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How would you define it?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many kinds of life vegetable, animal, human, angelic, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When John said, "In Him was life" John 1:4 , what kind of life did he mean?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And what is the difference between divine life and human life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a person dies, what life dies and what life still continues?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THREE LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How many lives do we Christians have?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament, in Greek, uses three different words for life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first is bios, from which we get the word biology, the study of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bios refers to the life in our body that the medical doctors deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another word is psuche, which is the root of our word psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psuche is translated soul; it refers to something other than our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a man dies, his bios dies but his psuche continues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third word is zoe, a kind of higher life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the word John used when he said, "In Him was life."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By natural birth zoe was not in us; we had only bios and psuche.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But John 3:16 tells us that when we believe in the Son i.e., receive Him, take Him in , we have zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps some illustrations will help us to keep these distinctions straight.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you neglect having breakfast, you feel hungry by mid-morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Which life in you is hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bios is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you have eaten well, but you still feel hungry for some enjoyment of music or a good time, which life is hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this case it is your psuche.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may come to the church meeting and have a good time singing and enjoying yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Afterwards, your psuche may be satisfied, yet within there may still be a sense of emptiness, or hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here it is your zoe that is crying out to be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why do you care only for your bios and psuche and neglect zoe?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely our experience confirms that we have these three lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CHRIST IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only was life in this One who was both the Word and God John 1:1 ; "the life was the light of men" v. 4 . In John 10:10 He further said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly." He called Himself "the bread of life" 6:48 and "the living bread which came down out of heaven" 6:51 . How much He is the Word, God, life, light, and the bread of life!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In John 15 He told His disciples that He was a vine not a tall tree sweeping the heavens but a low, spreading vine, reaching even to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not too high for us to reach.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is low and spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This vine grows horizontally to reach the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>NOT A PARABLE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some say that the picture given us in John 15 is a parable of our relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is more accurate to say that this vine with its branches is a divine, spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God the Father is a farmer tending this great vine which is growing and spreading throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We, as the branches, are here to branch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope your coming to the church meetings is not to have a good time; that is too low a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not here for a good time, but rather to branch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I long for us all to be in the reality of this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is our background which hinders our seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From our Christian background, our natural background, and our national background, we have the impression that we must do this and that for God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So we think, plan, schedule, and even move across the country!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Branches, though, just stay where they are and live the vine.</S>
