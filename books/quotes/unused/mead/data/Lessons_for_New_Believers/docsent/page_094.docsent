   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Worrying about Other Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should never be distracted and consider other things after we confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we are distracted, the Spirit will stop moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, it is very good for a sister to sense the need to confess as she is fellowshipping with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, she may suddenly remember that her child needs to go to school and that breakfast is not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once she begins to have such thoughts, the fellowship within will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or she may remember a relative who is recovering from an illness and needs prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If she begins to pray for this one, the inward feeling will disappear, and it will be difficult for her to continue fellowshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, when we sense something in our fellowship with God, especially the need to confess, we should never think of other things or bring other things into our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though we are still praying, these things can become serious distractions, and we will have no way to touch God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, they will cause us to lose His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not Being Restrained</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not feel restrained when we confess according to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we feel like crying, we should cry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we feel like laughing, we should laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we feel sad, we should be sad.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we feel happy, we should rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not be restrained in our inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is, however, another side to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we become skillful in fellowshipping with God, we should learn to exercise self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Initially however, there is no need to exercise any restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, immediately after confessing their sins, some people become afraid and hesitant to confess further.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, the Spirit stops moving within them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit is signified by a dove, which is very sensitive and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we limit Him or disagree with Him even a little, He will retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must obey Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If He wants us to confess, we must not hesitate, no matter what the sin may be.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This applies only to confession before God, not before men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In confessing before men, there are times when we should exercise restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As humans, we are very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to our experience, even our prayers are complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes we are concerned for this, and at other times we are concerned for that.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is difficult for us to simply and closely follow the inner feeling and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we are willing to be simple and not be concerned with other things but follow the feeling to confess, our prayer will lead us deep into God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may even have the experience of the outpouring and the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Praising and Giving Thanks</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to general experience, after we have a thorough confession, we can praise and give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, this is not a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not a procedure to memorize and follow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not think that we must always praise and give thanks after confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, after thoroughly confessing, a spontaneous feeling to praise God and give Him thanks may arise within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this time, we must release our inner feeling of praise and thanks without any reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we release this feeling, the more we will touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we withhold it, we will lose the feeling of God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we must convert a feeling of praise and thanks into words and fully release them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we praise and give thanks, the better; the more thorough this release is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Worshipping</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Toward the end of our fellowship, if there is still time, we should also worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is rather difficult to describe exactly what worship is and what our inner condition should be when we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may say that worship is a lingering before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not simply get up and leave as soon as we have finished praising and thanking God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No, we should linger before Him a little longer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This kind of lingering is the issue of our heart s desire for God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It involves beholding, waiting, and inquiring; we behold God s glory, lingering before Him to wait on Him and inquire of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not an inquiring related to specific things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, it is a waiting out of a desire to know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All these things are included in worshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praying for Practical Affairs</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this point some people spontaneously receive the burden to pray for certain practical affairs or to intercede, but this is not required.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not expect that there will always be a need to intercede for practical affairs each time we fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our time and energy do not allow us to do this, we should not take up this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our God is not a hard master.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He never requests us to do what exceeds our limits.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we should not force ourselves to pick up the burden to pray for practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not need to do this every time we fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, the first nine points that we have spoken of should be considered as principles to be followed each time.</S>
