   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JOHN'S INTENTION IN HIS GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to understand the Gospel of John, we need to know all the stories in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, it is not sufficient merely to know the stories.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would get into the depths of the truth in this book, we need to have the extract of each chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the messages in this series are actually concerned with the extracts of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These extracts are related to the signs in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John himself tells us that in writing this Gospel he selected certain signs performed by the Lord Jesus, signs that reveal different aspects of the divine life: "Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name" 20:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The record in the Gospel of John is different from that in the so-called synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not John's intention to describe the miraculous acts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, John's intention is to depict the divine life, portraying this invisible life through a number of visible cases.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All these cases are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter eleven we have the case of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this chapter the Lord says, "I am the resurrection and the life" v. 25 . Both resurrection and life are invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we did not have a tangible case, we could not understand resurrection and life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, here in this chapter is a specific case of a dead person who is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through this case we can come to know what resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, resurrection is the Person of the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that resurrection is not mainly what the Lord does; resurrection is primarily what the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because Christ is resurrection, when we have Him, we have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He is present, resurrection is present also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our study of the Gospel of John we need to see the significance of all the signs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we shall have the extract of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only are the cases recorded in this Gospel signs, but the main points revealed in each chapter also are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For instance, in chapter eleven there are five main points: death, sickness, the Lord's delay, men's opinion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these points are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even the Lord's delay is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is important that we understand what this delay signifies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The opinions expressed in this chapter are also signs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we grasp the significance of these signs, we shall have the extract of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SIGN OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us now consider the signs in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first of these signs is the sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Death signifies the last of the negative things to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is proved by Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 15:26: "The last enemy that is being abolished is death."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The last negative thing in us, the last problem that needs to be dealt with, is death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many Christians know that they have weaknesses, but they are not conscious of the problem of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the sight of God, everyone is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as an infant is born, that infant begins the process of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we did not have eternal life, our whole being would be in this process of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The older a person becomes, the more he thinks about dying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>An elderly person knows that death awaits him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He realizes that most of the years allotted to him have been used up and that very little time is left.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My point here is that, as far as the natural life is concerned, we all are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we realize this, the more we shall thank the Lord that we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we were born dead and because the element of death is in the fiber of our being, we need the Lord's life-giving salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 11 death is a sign of the last negative factor that remains to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the significance of the sign of death in chapter eleven of the Gospel of John.</S>
