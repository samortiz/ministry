   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only can you not divide Christ from the Spirit, but you also should not separate the Holy Spirit from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to what spirit shall we walk?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not just according to the Holy Spirit nor just according to the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But it is according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In like manner Romans 8:6 says that we need to set our mind upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What spirit is this?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again it must be the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even in the matter of being led by the Spirit as mentioned in verse 14, it is a matter of the human spirit with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit would never lead you apart from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He leads you when He is mingled with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He can never lead you unless your spirit is mingled by Him and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a subjective thing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this you can see that few Christians today actually understand the Spirit s leading because they don t know they have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the more, they don t know that the Holy Spirit today is one with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How then could they know the Spirit s leading?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The leading Spirit today is not only in our spirit, but also mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is such a mingled spirit who is leading us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes when people have problems, they think they need to go to a certain place and think about them for several days in order to solve them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our experiences tell us that the more we think concerning the problems, the more we get into the forest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We get into the thick woods because the leading is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the Leader is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Leader is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, this Leader makes our spirit a partnership of His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Forget about going to the mountain to think about something; turn to your spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of us could testify that regardless of the situation, when we would turn to our spirit, the sky is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is to be led by the Spirit in and through and with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we would cry, I m a son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He s my Father and I m His son!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He and I are one life!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are one nature!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then we would witness, and we would groan, and He would intercede within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are in such a groaning, in such an interceding, we are really one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We don t care for anything on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have no interest other than His.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are in this kind of situation, the law of the Spirit of life works, setting us free.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time no doubt we are actually sons of God, and we are members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Right away we are in the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now you see that the Lord couldn t have the Body life for centuries because there were no Christians who were in such a kind of situation-walking according to spirit, setting the mind on the spirit, putting to death every practice of the body, being led all the time, crying, witnessing, and groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be such a person in such a living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Right away we will be in the Body of Christ in an actual way.</S>
