She was born of a rich family and endowed with beauty and wealth. Once she was in a beautiful dress and met a preacher on her way home. The preacher told her that she was going down the wrong path and that she should believe in the Lord. She rejected his word. After she returned home, she said to God, "God, I hate You. I despise what You love, and I love what You hate. Even if you want to give me grace, I will not want it." Later she added, "But God, give me what I do not want. Give me what I do not have." Eventually she became a Christian and wrote a book called Christ Our Example. This proves that even those who hate and reject God can be saved.</p><h2 class="head2">Confession (August 2)</h2><p>Today many people consider confession as a big thing. They even consider it to be something bigger than the Lord's blood, as if forgiveness of sins comes from confession. The work of Dr. John Sung gives people such an impression. Many people do not believe that forgiveness of sin is through the precious blood of the Lord. Even if a man has not confessed his sin, the Lord's blood is still efficacious as long as he believes in the blood.</p><h2 class="head2">How Does the Blood Wash Us of Our Sins?<br />(July 25)</h2><p>How does the blood wash us of our sins? When a sinner sins, there is the sin-record before the Lord. When a man believes in the Lord, his name is written in the book of life, and his sin-records before the Lord are erased. After a man believes in the Lord, his sins are removed before God by the blood of the Lord. Read Revelation 20:12, 15 and Matthew 12:36-37. The Bible says that one's name can be "erased" from the book of life (Rev. 3:5; Exo. 32:32; Psa. 69:28), but this kind of "erasing" is not eternal perdition. Once a believer's name is recorded in the book of life, it can never be removed. When he sins, his name receives a mark against it.</p><p>In typology, when the priests slaughtered the animals on the altar, the blood was drained under the altar (signifying the washing of our conscience by the blood of the Lord) on the one hand, and the priests brought the blood into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled it upon the mercy seat on the other hand. When God saw the blood, He was satisfied. In the Holy of Holies, the law within the ark was covered by the blood, showing that God's righteous requirements have been silenced by the blood. Because of this God can now forgive our sins.</p><h2 class="head2">Personal Sin and Representative Sin (July 25)</h2><p>There is a difference between representative sin and personal sin. Personal sin is what a person commits when he acts as an individual. Representative sin is what a person commits when he acts in a representative position. A person's position as a master or a servant or as a male or a female is more than a personal position; it is a matter of representation. Matthew mentions being compelled to go a mile, being slapped on the right cheek, or being sued for a tunic. As far as personal conduct is concerned, it is enough for a person to endure all these treatments. But as far as him being a representative is concerned, enduring all these is not enough. We are God's children; this is a matter of representation, and we must go an extra mile, turn the other cheek, and give others the cloak as well. Only then will we properly represent God. God's love is shed abroad like the sunshine and the rain; He does not withdraw them because of man's scorn. If our heavenly Father is this way, we must be the same because we represent Him. Those who have not reached this standard may not have committed any personal sin, but they have committed a representative sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Testimony at Home (August 2)</h2><p>God's love for the world has the nation as the basic unit. The church has the city as the basic unit, while humanity as a whole has the family as the basic unit. Noah, Abraham, Ahab, Korah, Lydia, etc., were all mentioned together with their family as a basic unit. The judgment on a family will come upon the head of the household, who is the male. The Lord will ask how the head has dealt with his family. With a female, the Lord will only ask her to be accountable for herself. A male carries a double role; he must act in accordance with Ephesians 6:4. There was a professor from Princeton who had several sons. None of them believed in the Lord. When a colleague of his reminded him that he should bring his sons to the Lord, he began to admonish his sons concerning the way of the Lord. Yet none of them believed by the time they graduated. Later the professor died, and his children were still unbelievers. By the time these children grew old, however, they remembered the words of their father and were all saved. I have seen dozens of cases like this.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
