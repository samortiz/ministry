[1]  In this message we shall begin to consider the meetings of the church.
[2]  According to the New Testament, there are different categories of the gathering.
[3]  These categories include the gathering for the Lord's table, the gathering for prayer, the gathering for edification by exercising the spiritual gifts, the gathering for reading the Word of God, the gathering for listening to messages, the gathering for preaching the gospel, and the gathering for fellowship regarding God's move.
[4]  In this message we shall continue to consider the different categories of the gathering, and then we shall go on to see the way of gathering.
[5]  This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching of the teacher to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation of the prophet, v. 30 to give visions of God's eternal purpose concerning Christ as God's mystery and the church as Christ's mystery, a tongue as a sign to the unbelievers v. 22 that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable.
[6]  Thus, the church meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.
[7]  Every saint should have the equal right and opportunity to speak concerning Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ.
[8]  The church should also have large meetings in a larger place for the whole church to come together.
[9]  In this message we come to the status of the church.
[10]  The church as the assembly of the called out ones is composed of those who have been called by God.
[11]  First Corinthians 1:2 says, "To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours."
[12]  Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.
[13]  The church as the assembly is composed of the saints 1 Cor 1:2; Heb 2:12 .
[14]  This means that the church is composed of all those who have believed into Christ and who possess His life.
[15]  In the Bible there is the principle that the house of God is closely related to the kingdom of God.
[16]  In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul says, "If I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."
[17]  The dwelling place of God is the temple of God.
[18]  As the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar, the church testifies the reality, the truth, of Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.
[19]  When the church grows in Christ with the growth of God Col 2:19 , it will function as the house of the living God for His move on earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world.
[20]  In this message we shall see another aspect of the status of the church that of the kingdom of God.
[21]  Those who are not worthy to remain in the church life shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[22]  In 2 Peter 1:5-7 we have the development of the divine life with the divine nature from stage to stage.
[23]  Verse 5 says, "Adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue, and in virtue knowledge."
[24]  In this message we shall present a general view of the church as the Body of Christ, paying special attention to the formation of the Body by Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[25]  Because Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are one, the formation of the Body is intimately related to Christ in His person as the embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[26]  The three aspects of Christ's person as the Lamb, the Baptizer, and the Bridegroom reveal much concerning Him.
[27]  However, what is revealed concerning Christ in the New Testament is far greater than this.
[28]  We shall see much more concerning Christ's person as we view Him in relation to the formation of the church as His Body.
[29]  The formation of the church, the Body, is by Christ being the embodiment of the processed Triune God and becoming the life-giving Spirit to be breathed into God's chosen people.
[30]  The Christ who is the factor, the element, the essence, for the formation of the church as the Body of Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[31]  This chapter speaks of God v. 1 and also the Spirit of God v. 2 . Furthermore, the words "word" and "light," the means for producing God's creation, actually refer to Christ.
[32]  At the beginning of the Old Testament, the Triune God had not yet been processed.
[33]  But at the beginning of the New Testament we have the first step of God's process incarnation.
[34]  The Triune God, who created everything, entered into the womb of a human virgin and remained there for nine months.
[35]  This Triune God, as the Word, became flesh v. 14 . Christians often say that the Son of God became flesh, but they rarely say that the Triune God became flesh.
[36]  Referring to the type of the meal offering, we may say that the Lord mingled Himself as the all-inclusive oil with the disciples as the fine flour to make a cake.
[37]  This was the initial stage of the formation of the Body of Christ, the stage in which the Lord made fallen sinners, the descendants of Adam, into members of His Body by breathing Himself into them as the life-giving Spirit, who is the totality of the processed Triune God.
[38]  As a result, the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit was mingled with His chosen people to become one entity with them.
[39]  This entity is the church, the Body of Christ.
[40]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN THE CHURCH THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 5 THE BODY OF CHRIST 2
[41]  Paul is the unique one in the New Testament to speak concerning the Body.
[42]  In 1 Corinthians 12:14-22 Paul speaks of the indispensability of each member of the Body.
[43]  The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into Christ, the death of Christ Rom 6:3 , the name the person of the Triune God Matt 28:19 , and the Body of Christ.
[44]  In 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul tells us not only that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body but also that we "were all given to drink one Spirit."
[45]  The Body of Christ is constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[46]  Paul preached the unsearchable riches of Christ that the church as the Body of Christ might come into existence.
[47]  Being constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ is also related to knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ mentioned in Ephesians 3:19a.
[48]  In this message we shall consider further details regarding the church as the Body of Christ.
[49]  With the Individual Christ to Be the Corporate Christ
[50]  In the Bible "Christ" sometimes refers to the individual Christ, the personal Christ, and sometimes to the corporate Christ, to Christ and the church 1 Cor 12:12 .
[51]  Christ is the Head of this mysterious Christ, and the church is the Body of this mysterious Christ.
[52]  In Greek "Christ" in this verse is "the Christ," referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as its members.
[53]  As a vine includes not only the stalk but also the branches, so the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, includes not only Christ Himself but also the members of Christ's Body, who are the members of Christ, parts of Christ.
[54]  The Body as the corporate Christ is the new man Col 3:10 .
[55]  a. Arriving at the Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ
[56]  Since the Body is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all, we, the members of the Body, need to arrive at "the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" Eph 4:13 .
[57]  This reveals that the church is actually a part of Christ, for the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam Gen 2:21-23 .
[58]  A Great Mystery with Regard to Christ and the Church
[59]  In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of the mystery of God, which is Christ, and in Ephesians 3:4, of the mystery of Christ, which is the church.
[60]  In Ephesians 5:32 Paul says, "This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church."
[61]  The fact that Christ and the church are one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, is the great mystery.
[62]  It surely is a great mystery that the church as Christ's counterpart comes out of Christ, has the same life and nature as Christ, and is one with Christ.
[63]  The consummation of the church as the counterpart of Christ will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity.
[64]  After the woman had been built from his rib and brought to him, Adam exclaimed, "This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" v. 23a . In typology, this indicates that the church is a part of Christ; it is nothing less than Christ Himself.
[65]  When this Christ in His believers is added together, the sum equals the church, His counterpart, which is actually a part of Christ Himself. b.
[66]  In typology this indicates that the church, which is a part of Christ and which has come out of Christ, returns to Christ.
[67]  Concerning the church as the counterpart of Christ, we have seen that Christ and the church are a great mystery, that the church is the bride and that Christ is the Bridegroom, that Christ and His counterpart will be married at His coming back, that the counterpart of Christ will be consummated in the New Jerusalem, and that Christ and His counterpart will be a couple in eternity.
[68]  We have also seen that, as the counterpart of Christ, the church is typified by Eve as the counterpart of Adam, being a part of Adam, having come out of Adam, having returned to Adam, being one with Adam, possessing the life and nature of Adam, having the image and form of Adam, and becoming Adam's counterpart as his complement.
[69]  Cleansing Her by the Washing of the Water in the Word
[70]  Christ's work of sanctifying the church is accomplished by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the Word.
[71]  The church Christ presents to Himself will be "holy and without blemish."
[72]  To be holy is to be saturated and transformed with Christ, and to be without blemish is to be spotless and without wrinkle, with nothing of the natural life of our old man.
[73]  The church will be separated to the Lord from all common things and then saturated and permeated with the divine nature, with all that God is.
[74]  Concerning the status of the church, we have seen that the church is the assembly, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the Body of Christ, and the counterpart of Christ.
[75]  Ephesians 2:15 reveals that the church as the new man was created by Christ.
[76]  In Ephesians 2:15 we see that the new man was created by Christ in Himself.
[77]  It indicates that Christ was not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere in which and the essence with which the one new man was created.
[78]  All the ordinances were abolished by Christ on the cross.
[79]  When He was crucified, His death abolished, annulled, the different ordinances of human life and religion.
[80]  Furthermore, the differences among the races and the differences of social rank have been abolished by the death of Christ.
[81]  In the foregoing message we saw that the new man was created by Christ in Himself on the cross by His abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances.
[82]  In this message we shall first see that the new man was created according to God and in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[83]  Because the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ according to God, the new man bears the image of God.
[84]  Of the Two Peoples the Jews and the Gentiles
[85]  Christ Being All the Members and in All the Members
[86]  In Colossians 3:11 Paul says not only that in the new man there is no room for any natural person but that in the new man "Christ is all and in all."
[87]  In this message we shall see that the church as the new man needs to be put on by the believers.
[88]  Our life is Christ, our living is Christ, our intention is Christ, our ambition is Christ, our will is Christ, our love is Christ, and everything else about us is Christ.
[89]  By Being Renewed unto Full Knowledge according to the Image of Him Who Created the New Man
[90]  Ephesians 2:15 says that the new man was created, but Colossians 3:10 says that the new man is "being renewed unto full knowledge."
[91]  Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that the church, which is the new man, needs to fight against the enemy of God.
[92]  This is indicated in Genesis 1, where we are told that when God created the old man, He commissioned him to bear His image for His expression and to have His dominion for His representation to deal with the enemy.
[93]  2 Putting On the Various Attributes of Christ as the Whole Armor of God
[94]  The new man fights against God's enemy not only by being empowered in the Lord but also by putting on the various attributes of Christ as the whole armor of God Eph 6:11, 13-17 .
[95]  The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body.
[96]  Ephesians 6:13 and 14 say, "Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
[97]  The believers wrestle against the Devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies not only by being empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength and by putting on the whole armor of God, but also by "praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints" v. 18 . Here Paul specifically says that we are to pray in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.
[98]  In this message we shall begin to consider the final aspect of the status of the church the church as the golden lampstands.
[99]  With the lampstand as a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, there are three important things: the gold, the stand, and the lamps.
[100]  1 As the Seven Spirits of God to Express the Triune God
[101]  Revelation 4:5b says, "Seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."
[102]  If we consider Revelation 1:4 and 5, we shall realize that the seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God, because they are ranked among the Triune God.
[103]  In the Bible the golden lampstand is revealed in three stages.
[104]  The first is in Exodus 25, where the lampstand typifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.
[105]  As the Seven Eyes of Christ the Stone-Savior for God's Building
[106]  1 Taking Care of the Churches, as the High Priest, in His Heavenly Ministry
[107]  The garment in Revelation 1:13 indicates that here Christ, the Son of Man, is depicted as the High Priest.
[108]  As the testimony of Jesus, the golden lampstands are the embodiment of the Triune God.
[109]  The fact that the church is a golden lampstand indicates that we should not bring anything other than God into the church life.
[110]  All the golden lampstands are identical with one another, without any distinct characteristic.
[111]  2 Having God as the Light within Christ as the Lamp
[112]  Revelation 21:23a says, "The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it."
[113]  Hence, the glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and elements, is the light of the New Jerusalem, which shines in the Lamb as its lamp.
[114]  In the New Jerusalem Christ, as the lamp of the holy city, will shine with God within as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light.
