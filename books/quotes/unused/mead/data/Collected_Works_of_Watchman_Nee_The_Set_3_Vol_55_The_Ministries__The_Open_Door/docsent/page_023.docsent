   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUPPLY RECEIVED THROUGH FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the sake of His testimony in Tangshan, the Lord has chosen some brothers and sisters here to meet to worship and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to preserve and lead us, He has led us to fellowship often with His servants and all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This enables us to live in the supply of life in the Body, as well as preserves us in His will and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our last letter, we reported the condition of the assembly in Tangshan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Have you read it?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the past two months, Brother Sia came from Tientsin to fellowship with the brothers and sisters and to confirm that we are going on here in a proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of His love for us, the Lord has given each of the brothers and sisters trials of sickness and accidents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This has brought us to an awareness of our smallness and weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can only prostrate ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We beg the Lord to deliver us and have mercy on us so that by His grace we would not become those who slip away in this age!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the newly saved ones have grown so much in life, we could not delay baptizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After fellowshipping with Brother Sia and receiving confirmation, we baptized them peacefully and successfully with the Lord's support on August 1 the Lord's Day .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were thirteen brothers and eight sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tangshan now has a total of thirty-eight brothers and sisters who are baptized and who have been received into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we have not yet established the table to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are still looking for the Lord's arrangement concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We want to fellowship this matter with you and ask you to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you have the burden, please give us some advice concerning when and how we should establish the table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We hope you brothers will remember us for the sake of the commission of the Lord's glorious testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our report to you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the grace of the Lord be with you!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers in Tangshan,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lee Ze-zhe, Wang Yu-zhai, Wang Gui-wu, Enoch Hsiao,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Dai Ju-yu, Chui Yu-lin</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>August 4, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mailing Address: 7 Zuang-Yuan Third Strip, Tangshan City, Hopeh province</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NO LONGER TAKING THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OF INDIVIDUALISM</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Two months ago, I received a letter from Brother Jin-zhien, saying that many brothers had "handed over themselves," but he did not tell me the details and the extent of their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I thought that it was a general consecration in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not until two days ago, when I received and read Brother San-gang's own notes from the April conference in Shanghai that I realized that the extent of "handing over oneself" was not just an empty consecration in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was so concrete that even one's choice of career and dwelling should be in accordance with the church and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My heart rejoiced because the Lord had mercy on me, a small brother in the remote locality of Siying, and allowed me to know His ordained way in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am now willing to fully hand over myself, my job, and my dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not want to "go my own way" any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I want to be restricted, and I want to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I beg you brothers not to leave me behind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A few years ago, as I was preparing to go inland to take the college entrance exam for an engineering degree, I was clear that my goal of being an engineer after graduation was only a temporary measure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the time came, I would give up this earthly occupation and singleheartedly serve the Lord by preaching the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was about to graduate last year, I felt to shorten this time of temporary commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Presently, I am forced to take up a little of my earthly occupation because I am still immature in the matter of serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am ready to give it up whenever He wants me to.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I earnestly desire to receive more training during these days!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With regard to a job for me in Shanghai, it does not have to be with the Railroad Company.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Any job will do, as long as I am capable of doing it, and as long as it does not take away from my time of learning with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Any job will do, even if it is not with the Railroad Company private contractor, high school mathematics or physics teacher, or anything .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yu Pao-sheng</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>June 15, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mailing Address: c/o 38 Alley 240 Tung-Ren Road 23 Shanghai</S>
