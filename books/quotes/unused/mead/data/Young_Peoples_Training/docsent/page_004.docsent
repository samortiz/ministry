   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FULL GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Acts 26:18 the full gospel is presented.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The complete, perfect, whole gospel is found here: to open people s eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, be sanctified by faith, and enjoy the common portion of the saints to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this one verse there are seven points: 1 to open people s eyes, 2 to turn them from darkness to light, 3 to turn them from the authority of Satan to God, 4 to help them receive forgiveness of sins, 5 to help them to be sanctified by faith, 6 that they may have a common portion among the saints, and 7 be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Have you ever heard such a gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the gospel that the young people must preach to this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not preach the poor gospel about going to heaven preach the uplifted gospel revealed in Acts 26:18.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE NEED FOR PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is quite easy to point out all the seven facets of the gospel found in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But now you need to go to the Lord and pray, saying, Lord, open my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I don t need knowledge, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I need my eyes to be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, turn me from anything dark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I don t want to remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, turn me from darkness to light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are in it, people will realize it when we contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You also need to pray, Lord, turn me from the authority, the dominion, of Satan to Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I must be a person who is absolutely in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is my sphere, my realm, my kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I must be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you pray like this, you will become another person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can assure you that you will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If necessary, even fast and pray about these matters, saying, Lord, I want to have my eyes opened like they have never been opened before.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I don t want to be opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to have eyes like the four living creatures in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The living creatures have eyes everywhere, without and within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then when we contact people, they will realize that we are crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not opaque like others are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others may be good, ethical, religious, moral, and even scriptural, but they are opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When people contact us, they must immediately sense that we are crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not preaching this is witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also need to pray, Lord, grant me a full and thorough forgiveness of all my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I want to have a clearance of sins from the top to the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I would leave nothing that has not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, I also want to be fully sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I don t want to be merely a forgiven person but also a sanctified person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then I will be able to enjoy my portion, the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Day by day, we enjoy Christ as our portion, not in an individualistic way, but by enjoying Him among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who and where are the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are those who are sanctified in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The saints are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we get into the church, we get among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Oh, how we must pray over these seven matters!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Pray desperately to the Lord, saying, Lord, I want to experience the gospel that You revealed to Paul as mentioned in Acts 26:18.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I want to experience this full, complete, perfect, and thorough gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This gospel not only covers God s kingdom but also Satan s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It includes the rich Christ as our portion and all the saints as the corporate body, the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How we need to experience this gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we experience the whole gospel, we shall not merely be a preacher we shall be a witness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can guarantee you that whenever you pray this way, the Lord Jesus will appear to you, and His appearing will give you a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you will see certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In all these messages we need to see a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I cannot give you anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all must touch the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Does the Lord still need to knock you down?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Are you that stubborn?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no need to be so stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, we should say, Lord, I m here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You don t need to knock me down.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, I m here touching Your throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Open my eyes and turn me thoroughly from all darkness to light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Turn me from the dominion of Satan unto God and grant me a thorough forgiveness of all my sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>O Lord, sanctify me that I may enjoy You as my portion among the saints in the local churches.</S>
