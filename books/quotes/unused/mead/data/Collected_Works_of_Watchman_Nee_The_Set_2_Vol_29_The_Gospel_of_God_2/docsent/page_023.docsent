   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON JAMES 5:20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>James 5:19-20 says, "My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one's soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people also infer from these two verses that a saved person can perish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To them, in verse 19 we have the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in verse 20, we have the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To them, verse 19 says to turn a brother back, and verse 20 says that in turning back the brother, the soul is saved from death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This would mean that some brothers need to turn back, and some need to have their souls saved from death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Would this not say plainly that a brother can lose his salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to understand these two verses, there are a few things here that we have to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, James 5:19 and 20 are like a lone mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are not connected to the preceding verses, and they have nothing to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the other Epistles in the Bible have greetings and benedictions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>James is the only book that ends this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 17 and 18 speak of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of a sudden these few words seem to break in from nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a very peculiar thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, from chapter one until the end, the book of James is on practical love among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of love, there is the mercy, the care, and the concern for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what the book of James shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From 1:1 to 5:18, there is a continuous line, a definite goal, and a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 19 and 20, however, seem to drop down from nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One can say that 1:1 to 5:18 are very organized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we do not know where these two final verses come from.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, in principle, since James 1 through 5 speaks of love expressed in one's conduct, verses 19 and 20 should not deviate from this point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should also tell us what we should or should not do when we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a sinner continues in the error of his way, and you save him in love, you are saving a soul from death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition, you will also cover a multitude of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All readers of the Bible know that what covers a multitude of sins is love 1 Pet 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The many sins spoken of here do not refer to sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They refer to the sins before man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you turn a sinner from the error of his way, God will no longer remember his sins and will cast them into the deep sea.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All his sins will be under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose Brother Yuan was a very evil man before he became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His past history is very black and unseemly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know his past history and stories of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I could lay them out and expose them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if I expose his sins of the past, I am acting contrary to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has cast his sins into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we are saved, God does not mention our past sins any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I see a brother, I have to cover his past because among us God has covered our past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 20 is on the matter of principle, and verse 19 is on the matter of example.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, verse 20 is the formula, the law, and the principle of action, whereas verse 19 is the case study and the individual incident.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 20 says that if anyone turns a person, he will not die and his sins will be covered before God and before men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 19 shows us what happens when one brother among us is led astray from the truth or has erred in his way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to turn him back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The exhortation in verse 19 is based upon the principle in verse 20.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you see a brother in the church led astray from the truth, you have to recover him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a sinner is turned, his soul will not die and his many sins will be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This being the case, how much more should we do the same on behalf of a brother?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What James was saying here was that we should do unto the brothers as one would do unto the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>James is telling us here that a Christian should treat his brothers and sisters with love and should recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This portion is not speaking of a brother perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON HEBREWS 6:6</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we have to consider Hebrews 6:1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This passage presents the greatest problem in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Almost all the ones who doubt that salvation is eternal take Hebrews 6 as their city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of them dig their support material from here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They argue that if a man was saved and now has fallen away, it will be impossible for him to be renewed again to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Would that not mean that such a person is through and is doomed to perish?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because many are not clear, they take this passage as reason for man's perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we have to realize that the subject of Hebrews 6 is not salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It has nothing to do with salvation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If one wants to understand this passage, he must begin from the end of chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There it says that many who should be eating solid food are still taking milk.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to their age, this group of believers should have been the teachers already.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But they were still like babes and were not progressing, but were staying at the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, chapter six begins by saying, "Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The subject of Hebrews 6:1 is therefore progress, and not salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you put the subject of salvation in, surely you will encounter difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The purpose of this chapter is to tell others how to progress, and not to tell us how to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The first thing we must take note of is that the topic here is on progress to maturity, not regressing to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The apostle was here talking about being brought on to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verses 1 through 8 can be divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can use three words to represent these three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The first section is on having no need, the second section is on having no possibility, and the third section is on having no right.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This portion tells the Hebrew believers from these three standpoints that they have to progress.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First, they have to leave the word of the beginning of Christ and should not lay again a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The word of the beginning of Christ is like the cornerstone in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In building a wall, a person does not need two foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The apostle said that these ones had been talking about foundational things.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But the foundation was laid already; there was no need to lay the foundation again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The word of the beginning of Christ are teachings such as repentance from dead works, faith in God, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All these are the words of the beginning of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The apostle said that these need to be done only once.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There was no need to do them again.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He was exhorting them to go on to perfection.</S>
