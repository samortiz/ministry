   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Caring for God s Interest at the Age of Twelve</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Subjecting Himself to His Parents</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:41-51 we see that the Lord Jesus cared for God s interest at the age of twelve and also subjected Himself to His parents.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 42 says, And when He became twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the age of twelve, a boy was called by the Jews son of the law, and first incurred legal obligation Alford .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The number twelve also signifies eternal perfection in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, twelve years old indicates that what the Lord did here was perfectly related to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse says that they went up according to the custom of the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This custom was ordained by God for one to be a legal male in Israel Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to verses 43 through 48, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they realized that He was not with them in the caravan, they returned to Jerusalem searching for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they found Him, His mother said to Him, Child, why did You treat us like this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Behold, Your father and I are greatly distressed seeking You v. 48 . The Lord replied, Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father? v. 49 . This indicates that the boy Jesus was caring for the interests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words My Father in verse 49 point to the deity of the boy Jesus John 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His humanity He was the son of His parents; in His deity He was the Son of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 51 says that the Lord Jesus went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see the subjection of His humanity to His human parents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 2:41-51 we again see the Lord s dual status, His status as the Son of God and the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Son of God, He cared for God s interests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the Son of Man, He was obedient in His humanity to His human parents.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Advancing in Wisdom and Stature</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and in Favor with God and Men</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 2:52 we have the conclusion of the section concerning the youth of the Man-Savior: And Jesus kept advancing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As in verse 40, this wisdom of the Savior s deity was revealed in proportion to the measure of His growth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word for stature denotes not only stature as in 19:3, but also age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are told in verse 52 that the Man-Savior advanced in favor with both God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He advanced in favor with God because He was growing in the expression of God according to God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He advanced in favor with men because He was growing in human virtues, which are gracious to men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, He was growing as a God-man before God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both God and men were pleased with Jesus, happy with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have pointed out, all the incidents narrated by Luke in chapter two of this Gospel are strong evidences that the Lord Jesus was a real, genuine, proper, and perfect Man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, in chapter two of the Gospel of Matthew we have another category of events, and those events prove that the Lord Jesus was a King, a true descendant of David to inherit the throne and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, both Matthew 2 and Luke 2 speak concerning the youth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But they reveal different aspects of His status His status as the King and His status as a real Man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order for Him to be the King, there was the need of certain events to prove that He was the genuine heir and successor of David s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for Him to be revealed as a real Man, there was the need of evidences to prove the genuineness of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, in chapter two of Luke we have clear and strong proof that the Lord Jesus was a proper and genuine Man.</S>
