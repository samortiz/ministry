   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEEDING TO SUBMIT TO THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God builds His church upon His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has appointed deputy authority in all human government and institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the brothers and sisters in the church have to learn to submit to the authority of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We obey the elders because they are the Lord's deputy authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The basic principle governing Christian conduct on this earth is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is interesting that believers are exhorted to obey in all the Epistles, but these Epistles do not say anything about authority itself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where there is a demand, there must be the object of demand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, without the Word of God, we cannot have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we talk about faith all the time, but do not give others God's Word, no one can have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Similarly, if there is no authority, there can be no submission.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wants all the believers to practice submission in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that there must be an object of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The object of submission is the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church the elders act as God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God wants us to learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man truly knows authority, he will learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The young brothers and sisters should learn to have a proper response.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not talking about a kind of deliberate performance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it is a spontaneous reaction that comes when a person is confronted by something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have a proper response, the first thing that will come to our mind when we are confronted by a situation is, "Who should I check with in this situation?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time Brother Witness faces a situation, he asks, "Who should I check with concerning this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To whom should I submit?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we hand over ourselves, we enter into the coordination of the Body, and no member can be independent any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every member is under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any member who does not submit to the authority of the Head is a lame member.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CONCERNING THE AUTHORITY OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I would say a word to the elders concerning their authority: We have to have the basic understanding that there is no authority within ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The authority in the Body of Christ is Christ, the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the Holy Spirit who is operating in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, only the Holy Spirit is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit is the authority of Christ in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From where do the responsible brothers derive their authority?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not think that as long as a person is an elder he has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to know and understand authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only those who understand authority have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the elders do not understand authority, they are not qualified to be elders, and they are not fit to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not have any authority in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only difference between us and the brothers and sisters is that we know the authority of the Holy Spirit a little more clearly, and we are able to communicate the thought of the Spirit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elders do not have any authority in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are able to help the younger ones in the church because they recognize the authority of the Holy Spirit in Christ's Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders should never say, "I am the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have the authority to make decisions for you."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, they should say that they recognize the Holy Spirit more.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason they can open their mouth and speak, and this is the reason they can represent God's authority before the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An elder becomes God's authority by knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let me relate a story to you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Shanghai, Brother Du, Brother Chu-chen, and Brother Yu Cheng-hwa are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brother Du is the most senior among them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As far as his human stature is concerned, he is as mature as Brother Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The social and political condition in Shanghai is such that the church has little to offer to out-of-town visitors in terms of hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once a brother from the church in Shanghai was led by the Spirit to open his house to a midnight visitor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Du came and told me that the brother was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was right for him to provide hospitality, but it was wrong for him to do so without fellowshipping first with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I told him that there was nothing wrong with it as long as it was done under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Besides, how can a person seek fellowship from the elders in the middle of the night?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are helping the brothers and sisters know the authority of the Holy Spirit, not to submit to us as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was right for this brother to obey the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The elders are here not to build up their own authority, but to lead the brothers and sisters to know the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the brothers and sisters have to learn to submit to authority, but all the responsible brothers have to see that they do not have any authority in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the brothers and sisters make a mistake, we have to rebuke them, not because they have offended our authority, but because we know the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should rebuke them because they have offended the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The young brothers and sisters should remember that in disobeying the responsible brothers, they are disobeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The responsible brothers should not try to build up their own authority; they should not consider that they have authority in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The whole church must help the brothers and sisters submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They should know that they are rebelling against the authority of the Holy Spirit when they do not listen to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the meaning of submitting to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have spent a great deal of time to select the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have had much consideration in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In appointing the elders, we are not saying that these ones have any authority in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are merely saying that they know more of the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the reason the church has to accept their decision.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It does not mean that their decision is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The elders should not set their heart on the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, they should set their heart on whether or not the one-talented gifts are being utilized.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the one-talented ones are not utilized, the church is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Of course, once the one-talented ones are called into use, their flesh will easily follow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These one-talented ones may serve happily in the church, but their service will bring in confusion if they do not submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, the church must not only recover the function of the one- talented ones, but it must recover the practice of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way, the church will have a way to go on, and the service will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is unprofitable to drag someone into the service without the proper discernment.</S>
