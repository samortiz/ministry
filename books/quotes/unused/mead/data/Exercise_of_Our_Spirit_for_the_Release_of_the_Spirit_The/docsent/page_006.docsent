   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SINGING WITHIN THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The most significant matter regarding Christ in this psalm is the sweet smell of His death and resurrection, and the most significant matter regarding the church in this psalm is the singing and praising typified by the harpstrings in Psalm 45:8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The early church in the book of Acts is the fulfillment of this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Out of the death and resurrection of Christ came forth many local churches in various places, and from those churches came forth singing and praising to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This made the Lord glad.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The churches as ivory palaces come out of the death and resurrection of Christ and are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within these dwellings there must be singing all the time, music which makes the Lord glad Heb 2:12; Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, we need to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is more difficult to pray than to gossip, and in a sense, it is even more difficult to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are not in the spirit, it is not easy to sing, but when we are in the spirit, it is easy, and the more we sing, the more we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must be overflowing, bubbling over, and singing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our meetings there should be more singing than talking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the church is in resurrection, our singing must also be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people naturally like to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we should not sing in a natural or emotional way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we sing, we should not think about the music or try to sing in a musical way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will kill the singing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, we should sing in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before the meetings we should learn a new hymn and memorize some choruses or stanzas.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then there will be no need to sing from our hymnals; rather, we can sing from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do this, we will see how living, active, and positive our meetings will be.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will be living, and we will be free from the letter and formality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The right way to exercise our spirit is to pray, but sometimes singing a hymn is even better than praying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we try singing a hymn in the morning, our spirit will be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we sing, the more our spirit will be released and strengthened, and the more our mind will be focused, our will subdued, and our emotions purified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Singing in the proper way will deliver us from our natural mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the best way to be liberated from the things of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our singing is a test of whether or not we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are in the spirit, we will constantly be singing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even while we are driving, we will have a song or a hymn with which to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our singing and praising are a strong testimony to others that we are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE CHURCH BEING IN THE DIVINE NATURE AND FILLED UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Psalm 45:9 says, The queen stands at Your right hand in the gold of Ophir.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The queen is the church, and the gold is the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the queen being in the gold of Ophir indicates that the church, which is full of the praises of Christ, is in the divine nature of God 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 13 and 14 say, The King s daughter is all glorious within the royal abode; / Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>/ She will be led to the King in embroidered clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The queen is in the gold of Ophir because her clothing is embroidered with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This signifies that the divine nature has been wrought into the daily living, walk, conduct, and behavior of the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In their daily living and walk is the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church as a dwelling place for Christ in His resurrection is in the divine nature and is filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more time I spend with the Lord, the more I feel that it is not the forms, rules, teachings, or doctrines that are important.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, what is important is exercising the spirit, realizing the death and resurrection of Christ, practicing the genuine church life, and entering into the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must exercise our spirit which has been mingled with the Holy Spirit so that we may realize the death and resurrection of Christ, having the sweet smell of His resurrection and His golden nature wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only way for the whole church to be in the divine nature and full of God is to exercise our spirit, and the best way for us to exercise our spirit is to sing praises to the Lord and to overflow with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Psalm 45 is a short psalm, but it is quite meaningful and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this psalm we have the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the church in resurrection, the singing and praising of the church, and the fullness of God, the expression of God, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>DROPPING THE NEGATIVE THINGS AND</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO OVERFLOW AND SING</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The saints in the early church had no forms, regulations, teachings, or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, what they had was the living Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever they came together, they were an ivory palace the issue of the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They had the inward filling of the Spirit and the outward praising of the Lord and singing to Him from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, during the two thousand years that the church has been on the earth, many negative things that are unnecessary and even troublesome and disturbing have come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unfortunately, we have been very much influenced by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we must give up all the negative things, including the forms, rules, regulations, teachings, and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not easy to give up and forget about all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have an abundance of many of these negative things and are short of the one positive thing the praising in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some may be able to give messages or write books on spiritual matters, but they cannot sing a hymn with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not a proper situation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this situation the mind is too big and active, and the spirit is deadened and dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is almost no activity or functioning in the spirit; rather, all the activity is in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, we must exercise our spirit to sing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>John and Charles Wesley sang every day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we sang for even half an hour each day, our spirit would be much stronger, and the meetings of the church would be much more living and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The meetings would have an impact and an effect on people because something would be constantly flowing and bubbling in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As Psalm 45 indicates, we must have these two matters the overflowing and the singing with the music of the harpstrings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are praising, singing, and overflowing all the time, we will realize the death and resurrection of Christ and will be the real ivory palace filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We will have the gold, the divine nature, wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must find a way to release and liberate our spirit and to make our spirit active, living, and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are too strong in the soul and too dormant in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Too often we pay attention to the body and the soul and neglect the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we exercise our spirit, the Lord will be liberated because the Lord today is in our spirit as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thus, we must learn to pray and to praise by singing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This will issue in a real deliverance, liberation, and release of our spirit.</S>
