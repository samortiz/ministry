It is really terrible that the communication is so poor. My company has temporarily stopped doing business because of the war. My health has been bad for more than a month. You can imagine the condition the church is in under such circumstances. Please do not forget to pray for us! I received the letter you sent through Ming-hwei. I sent a letter in reply, but I am concerned about whether it will get to you. (It has not arrived&mdash;Editor.) I hope to receive some instructions with regard to my present situation. Greet Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and all the brothers and sisters in Chungking. May you be blessed with health in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Wei<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Soo-Jia-Tsui, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>All the churches in northern Kiangsu are still under the Lord's blessing. There are several more churches than there were two years ago. This is the Lord's special grace. Brother Ji is still in Soo-Jia-Tsui. I have been away from home for the most part since the fall of last year. Thank and praise the Lord. He constantly leads me. It is not beneficial for a worker or for a church to have the worker stay in one place for a long time because (1) the Lord's gifts are kept from spreading to other places, (2) it becomes difficult for gifted local ones to rise up to serve the local church, and (3) it becomes a sect subconsciously, with certain churches belonging to certain individuals. The article on the principle of the work in the second issue of The Open Door is very important. I have not decided where I will go next. I did not receive the second issue of The Open Door. I have already received the fourth issue. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chiu Ri-jien<br />March 30</p><h2 class="head2">Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Last October, I fled from Hangchow to Chou-Jia-Pu in Shi-Siang. I stayed there for more than a month. My wife gave birth to a child one night. When I desperately needed help, a woman suddenly came from the mountain and helped me. This really was God's provision for me; glory be to Him. After nineteen days I took my family into the mountains. Unfortunately, it rained the whole time, the roads were winding and muddy, and my child kept slipping and falling. Thank God for His protection. We finally arrived at a place in the mountains. We stayed in a gospel chapel for three Lord's Days. Then my family and I walked to Yi-Chiao. It was about thirty miles over mountain roads. This was on the road back to Shao-Shing. It was not easy to travel with a little baby. It was especially difficult because the boats had all stopped running. I could only pray silently for God's leading. He indeed made marvelous provisions! I met someone from my home town. It was actually one of my neighbors. He was just hiring a boat to go back home. If we had arrived two hours later, he would have been gone. We were able to ride in the boat with him straight home. At this point my heart overflowed with praise: "Eye has not seen and ear has not heard...things which God has prepared for those who love Him." Where is Brother Luan? Please greet Miss Miao and Miss Tso. Please send me The Open Door beginning with the first issue so I can read them all. May you be blessed with the Lord's presence.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Hsu Tseng-rong<br />March 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_125.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_127.html">Next</a> </body></html>
