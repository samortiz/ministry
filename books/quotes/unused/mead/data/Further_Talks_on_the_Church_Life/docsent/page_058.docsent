   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Going Out and Coming Back</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You will remember that Peter went out to Caesarea and returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then Peter went to Samaria because the work of God was in Samaria and then returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jerusalem was the center, whereas Samaria was a city in that region of work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The co-workers gathered in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They went out and came back, came back and went out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having a worker rule over a church in a locality is a Protestant thought; it is not the thought of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only God can make the decision as to which locality should be taken as the center for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only God knows how and where to start; only the Holy Spirit knows how to initiate the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man's decision is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot decide which locality is "Jerusalem" through our own discussion, because God wants to do that Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This matter is in the hands of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the Jerusalem appointed by the Holy Spirit is Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first part of Acts, we see Peter going out and coming back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, we see Paul going out and coming back to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They never remained in a locality but always came back.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must see that the work has an area as well as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether we call it a region, an area, or a center, these are but terms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to emphasize the essential thing behind the terms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the work in Jerusalem there was something essential.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It matters not whether we call it an area, a center, or a region.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same is true with Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the Lord measures a portion to a work, it is right to call it the measure of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One group of workers dwells in one area, region, or center, while another group of workers dwells in another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Elders are not assigned to certain places from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the case of Peter, he was not simply an apostle, and he was not simply an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was both an apostle and an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, brothers, when you, as a co-worker, reside in a locality, you are there as both an apostle and an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Taking this path in such a way is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is right that some of our brothers go out to help, but they must come back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not right for them to stay and not return.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Either they go out and travel a large circuit and then return like Paul, or they go out and immediately return like Peter both are right.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Coming back is a must.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If men blame Peter for not going out, they have to blame Paul for returning as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter returned to Jerusalem, and Paul to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God's Word; nothing can be clearer than His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE APOSTLES' PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL AND THE PREACHING BY THE WAY OF MIGRATION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we will see the third matter, that is, how the work of God is carried forward and how the gospel is preached.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we have two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the work of Jerusalem is different from that of Antioch, so we have two different ways of preaching the gospel and two different ways of establishing churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Way of Antioch the Apostles Going Out</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, it can be done according to Antioch's way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul and Barnabas, Paul and Timothy, or Paul and Silas went to one place after another to preach the gospel and then returned to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was the apostles who went out to preach the gospel and the apostles who went out to establish churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is one way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Way of Jerusalem Going Out by Migration</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second way is Jerusalem's way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way all the believers migrated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They preached the gospel in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This migration resulted in the gospel spreading everywhere Acts 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether a migration is done peacefully or as a result of persecution, a migration is still a migration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way of Jerusalem is to migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only thing special was that they went out because of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I think that the Lord has left very clear footprints here.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should never think that the first half of Acts is of little significance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts, like Genesis, is a record of God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we see how God worked at the beginning, we can do the same today.</S>
