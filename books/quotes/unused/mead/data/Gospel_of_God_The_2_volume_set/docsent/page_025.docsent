   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Jude 21 says, "Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This verse shows us that today we should keep ourselves in the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Until the Lord comes again, that is, until He appears to us, we should await His mercy unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we are raptured, we should await His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today while living on this earth, we receive not only mercy, but also grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank the Lord that we have been saved and belong to God, but there is still one problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our bodies are not yet redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we are no longer of the world, we are still in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is good not to belong to the world, but this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sooner or later the Israelites had to leave Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sooner or later Noah had to leave the ark to enter into the new age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sooner or later Lot had to leave Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And the day must come when the Christians must leave the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While I am being attacked in this world, I await the mercy of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While I am being entangled by sin in this world, I await the mercy of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While I am being buffeted by Satan in this world, I await the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, while we are living on earth and keeping ourselves in the love of God, we await the day when the Lord will show mercy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, it is still necessary for His mercy to be upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to await His mercy until the day that we are raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible shows us one thing more concerning mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament, the word mercy is always preceded by either show or have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mercy is something that is shown, and those who are shown mercy are said to have received mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why does the Bible say "to show mercy" instead of "to give mercy"?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is because mercy does not require our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace, on the other hand, requires some doing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we obtain grace we obtain something definite.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when we receive mercy, it is only a receiving; all that we have to do is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 4:16 exhorts us to come often to the Lord to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we come to pray before the Lord, we will receive mercy and find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some versions use the expression obtain mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But actually, in the original language, the word is not obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Obtain is something too active.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word is more passive in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It should be translated "receive."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are to receive mercy and to find grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is to receive?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To receive means that everything is here; it is always ready for use anytime.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Grace is something that you have to "find," because it is something that God will do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Grace is something positive; it is something to be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That is why it says to "receive" mercy and to "find" grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible is very clear about mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no confusion between the two.</S>
