<h1 class="title">THE SPEAKING IN OUR MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 21:15, 17; Rev. 3:1-2; 2:7, 17; 3:20-21; 1 John 1:6; 2 Cor. 13:14; 1 Thes. 5:17; Col. 4:2; 1 Tim. 2:8; Psa. 119:147-148; Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:19-21; Gal. 2:20</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we want to fellowship concerning a very subjective matter, that is, the speaking ones in our meetings. To speak in the meetings is really today&rsquo;s problem among the Christians. The Christians who are in the denominations have hardly any idea about the matter of speaking in their services because they are used to coming to these services not to speak. They were trained this way, built up this way, raised up this way, and made a person in this way. When they go to their church services, they have no thought or idea about speaking in them. Today on this earth among all the Christians, where is the mutuality in speaking? No one gets prepared to give a word in the meeting except for the clergy, the ones who have been appointed to speak. Everyone has a strong thought that to go to the church service is to listen to a pastor or a minister speak. This is the habit. This is not only the practice among most of the Lord&rsquo;s children, but this is also something built up in their blood. This terrifying matter still remains in our blood.</p>
<p>Many of us have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for ten or more years. Since we came into the church life and have been meeting with the saints in the church life, we have been attending the church meetings every week. We are the regular ones in the church meetings, the faithful ones. We attend the meetings as much as we can, and we have never missed one meeting intentionally. If you have been such a person in the recovery, attending about three meetings a week, you have attended about one hundred fifty-six meetings a year and fifteen hundred sixty meetings in ten years. When you attended all these meetings, how many times did you get yourself prepared to speak? I would even ask how many times you thought about speaking in these meetings. In this matter, most of us must admit that we are &ldquo;birds of the same feather.&rdquo; Whether we have been in the church life for ten years or just for one month, most of us do not have the thought of getting ourselves prepared to go to the meetings to speak. If none of us have this thought, then who is going to speak in the meeting? We say we have left the denominations, but the practice, the habit, of the denominations still follows us and even remains in us.</p>
<p>We must endeavor to have church meetings with many speaking and without speaking by only one person. Some of us, however, still like to be spectators in the meetings. All of us should get ourselves prepared to speak in any meeting that we attend. Although we may have been Christians for many years, we do not have the thought that we need to rise up to be the speaking ones in the meetings. The way of meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening is an annulling way.</p>
<p>Recently some leaders of certain denominations in the United States gathered together to talk about how to evangelize the entire world by the year 2000. Their conclusion was that they did not have enough manpower. How can they say that they have no manpower when they have millions of members? One denomination alone in the United States has approximately fourteen million members. In spite of so many people, they do not have the manpower. Where are all these people? Nearly everyone&rsquo;s function was killed by the way of Christianity. If only ten percent of the fourteen million members of that certain denomination were living and functioning members, these one million four hundred thousand could turn the world upside down (Acts 17:6).</p>
<p>The practice of Christianity has annulled the functions of the members of the Body of Christ and has choked them. This practice has delayed the Lord&rsquo;s return. Why has the Lord been waiting for the past nineteen hundred years? He is still waiting. The night is darker, and there is hardly any sign among the Lord&rsquo;s children that the day of His appearing is going to dawn. This is because of the deadening, choking, and annulling practice which is according to the traditional way of today&rsquo;s Christianity. This practice crept into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and it is still here in us in a hidden way. We must take the Lord&rsquo;s new way, the scriptural way, of meeting and serving. The churches and the saints who have taken the scriptural way and practiced it with no opinion have gained the increase and have been revived. This is because they are simple. The cleverness of the complicated people is killing.</p>
<p>The trouble today is that the denominational blood still remains in our person. We have the habit of doing things according to the traditional way. To some of us it may seem terrible not to have a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day with a good speaker speaking to us. Some may not be so happy with the change of our way. But we must realize that the truth overcomes. Nothing in this universe can do anything against the truth. We need to labor in the scriptural way with endurance. For us to have a full success in this new way may take five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years, thirty years, or even fifty years. Eventually, what we have been speaking concerning the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ will be very prevailing on this earth. The Lord has to fulfill His word. He has to do something on this earth, not to build up Christianity as a kind of &ldquo;church,&rdquo; an organization, but to build up His Body as an organism. This can only be done by the new way that the Lord has shown us.</p>
<p>There are basically two ways we can take for our meeting life. One way is for us to have a pastor, or a minister, speak to us every Sunday morning. Another way is for all of us to speak in the meetings. Which way is better? We all know which way is better because we have tasted it to a certain extent. If the way of everyone speaking is better, then we must desperately endeavor to build up a habit of speaking in every meeting. The way of everyone speaking is undoubtedly better, but this way depends on something. Gold is obviously better than copper, but our possessing of gold depends upon whether we would pay the price or not. Sometimes I did not want to spend that much money for a pen, so I bought some inferior ones. After a short time, these pens were no longer any good. One day one of my relatives gave me a very good pen as a gift, and I have been using it for about seven years. I could have had such a pen in the past, but that depended upon whether or not I would pay the price. Would we pay the price to practice the new way? To hire a good speaker and listen to him speak is easy to practice. There is nothing required of us. But for us to be the speaking ones in our meetings involves at least seventeen &ldquo;musts.&rdquo; In this chapter we will cover the first eight. We should pay the price to take the way of all of us being the speaking ones in our meetings. But would we pay the price? It is not a matter of whether or not we could pay but of whether or not we would pay the price.</p>
<p>It is much easier to establish a religious organization than it is to build up the church as a living organism. To establish an organization we must first raise up enough funds to rent or build a meeting place. Then we need to hire a pastor, or someone with an official degree. After we do this, we basically do not need to do anything else. We are only required to attend one or a few services and give some of our income. Then we can go back home to live the way we desire. On the next Sunday, we will come again to listen to a good speaker. This is the way in today&rsquo;s Christianity, but this is not the God-ordained way, the biblical way. It is the way according to tradition, the way according to the customs of the nations, the way that fits man&rsquo;s fallen condition. This denominational way does not need us to be revived nor does it require any kind of church life. To walk in the traditional way, the denominational way, there is no need for us to be persons who pray or who love the Lord. This way of meeting and serving fits man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition.</p>
