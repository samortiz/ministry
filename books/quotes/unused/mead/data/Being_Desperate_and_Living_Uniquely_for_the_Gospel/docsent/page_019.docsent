   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING UNIQUELY FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My intention is to impress you that in the universe and today on this earth there is something called the gospel which we are reminded and commanded to live for.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord commanded us to live for this gospel uniquely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What are we living on this earth for?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do we live for our profession or for our job to make a lot of money?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is man living for?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Poor human society has so much activity but no goal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do we have a goal?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our goal is the gospel, and our gospel is the Triune God processed to be the very Spirit within us as our salvation, as our life, as our life supply, and as our all-inclusive enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a wonder and what a glory to live uniquely for such a gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have been living uniquely for this gospel for over fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hallelujah for this!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is worth it!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was called by the Lord, my thinking was that God had called me to go to preach and teach in all the villages of my county, not even to my entire province.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I had done that all my life, I would have been more than happy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I never thought that I would be speaking in the United States and in other parts of the world to an international audience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the Lord's mercy I am living uniquely for the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOING WITH THE AUTHORITY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the end of the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord came as the very embodiment of the processed Triune God in resurrection and told us that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The President of the United States sends ambassadors to many countries representing him with full authority, but why do we need this kind of authority, all authority in heaven and on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need this authority to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of us have to ask ourselves how many we have discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you believed in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you received Him?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you have Him living in you?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are you one spirit with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are you abiding in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is He now abiding in you?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are you and He one?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you say yes to these questions, you have the authority in heaven and on earth to go!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The worth and importance of the word "go" cannot be measured.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Go, go, go!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Go to Jerusalem first, then Judea, then Samaria, then to the remotest part of the earth Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Go to all the homes in all the countries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Go to your cousins' homes, go to your in-laws' homes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Go to the homes to disciple the nations.</S>
