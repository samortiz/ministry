   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen, all that God is, is embodied in the Son and all that God does is related to Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s plan, His activity, and the accomplishment of His will are involved with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever God is life, light, holiness, righteousness, love, kindness is embodied in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we see the vision of this, we receive the Son and have life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are also attached to Christ, the anointed One, and become part of the corporate Christ, the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom is composed of many transformed sons of Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Simon was not a part of the kingdom, but Peter was.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The son of flesh and blood is not part of the kingdom, but the son of the living God is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are you a son of Jonah or a son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are you part of Jonah or part of the anointed One?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are a son of the living God and if you are a part of the anointed One, you are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the church, we are on the defensive, but as the kingdom, we are on the offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said, On this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse the gates of Hades are on the offensive, and the church is on the defensive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when we are the kingdom, we are on the offensive, binding and loosing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we are sons of blood and flesh, we are food for Satan, for Satan eats the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are sons of Jonah, we cannot shut the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when we are Peters, not Simons, and are constituted with the Son of God and the Christ, we are no longer Satan s food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we are those who shut the gates of Hades and block the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are the church against which the power of darkness cannot prevail, then we are the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of waiting for the gates of Hades to attack us, we bind the gates and shut them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are able to command Satan to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are both the church and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE KINGDOM AS THE TRANSFIGURATION OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 16:28 the Lord said, Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then in 17:1 and 2 the Lord was transfigured on the mountain before Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that His transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before He was transfigured, there was no kingdom, because He was still a natural Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when He was transfigured and entered into another realm, the realm of transfiguration, that realm became the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the kingdom is the transfiguration of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to apply this principle to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are natural, we are sons of Jonah, not part of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when we are transformed into Peters, we have the keys of the kingdom, which were given not to Simon, but to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The keys of the kingdom were not given to the natural man, but to one who had been reconstituted and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Simon was transformed into Peter, he immediately received the keys of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>RECONSTITUTED</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prior to chapter sixteen, the Lord Jesus said nothing to His disciples about His crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only after they had seen Christ and the church, did He reveal His cross and resurrection to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apart from the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, it is impossible for any son of Jonah to be reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, every natural man would remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A son of Jonah can be transformed and reconstituted only through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through death and resurrection Simon Bar-jona became Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>TRANSFERRED BY DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to understand how we are transferred from a son of Jonah to a Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the rock, the Lord Jesus was cleft, and living water flowed out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have pointed out that the cleaving of the rock signifies the crucifixion of Christ and that the flowing out of the living water signifies His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Lord appeared to His disciples on the day of His resurrection, the mark of the cleft was still visible in His side John 20:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By Christ s being cleft, not only was the veil removed, but the living water was released.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Living water is still flowing out of the Lord s side today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because He is the Spirit, we can drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the day we began to drink of Him, we were transferred from Simon to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moreover, by continuing to drink of Him we were solidly founded upon the rock, which is the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, Christ is the flowing water; on the other hand, He is the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the principle of first mention, the significance of the rock in the Old Testament is the fact that it is cleft so that water can flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, this cleft rock flowing with water becomes the foundation stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today nearly all Christians know that Christ is the rock upon which the church is built and that He is the foundation of the church 1 Cor 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, not many know the significance of Christ as the rock and the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The significance is that the rock firstly is cleft so that the living water can flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then as we drink of this flowing water, the cleft rock becomes our foundation, and we are solidly founded upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By drinking of the water from the cleft rock, we are transferred from Simon to Peter and we are founded upon the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Within us we have the flowing water, and beneath us we have the solid rock.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Being founded on the rock is not merely a matter of becoming a Christian and then coming together with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That is human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To repeat, Christ was cleft to flow out the essence of God as the living water to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today He is the cleft and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we see this vision, we respond to Him and drink Him in. I did this more than fifty years ago, although I did not know the meaning of what I had done.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But as I recall my experience at the time I was saved, I realize now that I took a good drink of Christ and was watered within.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Furthermore, I was transferred out of Simon into Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although I was still muddy, the transfer had in fact taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, at that time I became solidly founded upon the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before I was saved, I was like a piece of driftwood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But after I received the Lord, I was founded on the cleft and flowing rock, on the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we are transferred and founded, we become the church and we are no longer food for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Because our constituent has been changed, Satan can no longer eat us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If Satan tries to eat us, he will say, Oh, I don t want to eat this!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once you were so tasteful to me, but not anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many times I have said to Satan, Satan, you don t want me, and I don t want you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I command you to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When this is our condition, we are not only the church on the defensive, but also the kingdom on the offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>REACTING TO WHAT WE SEE</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Are you a Simon or a Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you are a Peter, then one day you saw the Christ, the Son of the living God, and you reacted to what you saw.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You could not deny what you had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some reacted by praying, others by crying, and still others by confessing how sinful they were.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our reaction depends upon what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Your reaction was your drinking of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>By drinking Him, you received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In other words, by your reaction, by your drinking, the Son of the living God came into you.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He will never leave you, although there may be times when you think you want Him to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>By our drinking of Him, the Son of the living God has been brought into our being, and we have been solidly founded upon the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is the constituent of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we are such a church, we are spontaneously the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The kingdom is both the transfiguration of Jesus and the transformation of so many sons of Jonah into Peters.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>All these sons of Jonah have been reconstituted to become not only the church on the defensive, but also the kingdom on the offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Lord was cleft in His crucifixion and flowed out the living water in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we saw this vision, we reacted to Him and drank Him in.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If you never see anything, you will not have any reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>For example, as you drive along the highway, you react to the scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The aim of this ministry is to cause you to react.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The more reaction, the better, for when you react, you drink.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Every reaction is a drink that causes a further transfer and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Some may not care whether or not they attend the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Those who stay home from the meetings are like those who never travel anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Because they stay home, they see nothing new and hence have no reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We need to take a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Then we shall have one reaction after another.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It does make a difference whether or not we come to the meetings, for in the meetings we will see things that cause us to react; and whenever we react, we drink.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>By drinking, we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Have you seen that all that God is, is embodied in the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If you see this, you will react.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Have you seen that all that God does is related to Christ, the anointed One?</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If you see this, you also will react.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Have you seen that on the day of resurrection Peter received the Son of God and that on the day of Pentecost he was attached to the anointed One?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Anyone who sees this will have a strong reaction and be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>After you have seen this, it will not be so easy for you to be the same as you were before.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We need to have more reactions so that we may experience a further transfer from Simon to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This transfer is for the church and the kingdom.</S>
