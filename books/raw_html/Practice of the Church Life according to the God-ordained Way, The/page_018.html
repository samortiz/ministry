<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Concerning the Nature of the Oneness<br>of the Body, re: Denominations</H2><P>When the dissenters began to cause trouble in 1987, they claimed that I had changed and that my change had affected the nature of the recovery. I admit that I changed from the old way of gospel preaching to the scriptural way of visiting people. I also told people to turn from having church meetings with one man speaking and the rest listening to meetings in which all can prophesy according to the revelation of 1 Corinthians 14. I changed in these matters, but my change did not affect the nature of the oneness of the Body.</P><P>The opposing ones have said that I was right before 1984 but not since then. They said that I used to minister life but that now I minister budgets, numbers, and activities. From September 1987 until now, I have given many messages and conferences. These messages have not been concerning budgets, numbers, and activities, but they are full of the unveiling of the divine truths and the ministry of the divine life.</P><P>The opposing ones also said that we have applied the teaching concerning the ground of oneness in a divisive and sectarian way so that we separate ourselves from other Christians. Actually, we receive all the Christians, but we cannot accept the divisions in which they meet. The denominations are not just differences; they are divisions. Hence, we cannot take them. We differentiate, however, between the saints and the denominations. The denominations are one thing, but the saints in the denominations are another thing. We receive the saints who are in any of the denominations and also those in the Catholic Church, but we cannot receive the organization of the denominations.</P><P>I spoke concerning this matter many times, and my speaking has been printed. These dissenting ones heard my speaking and have also read the books, but they have neglected these things. They have said that we are too narrow, that we feel that only we are right, and that we do not receive other Christians. This is not a fair statement. We receive all of the Lord's children, the genuine believers in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Concerning the Apostles' Existence<br>and How They Relate or Work Together</H2><P>The dissenting ones have also raised an issue concerning the apostles' existence and how they relate with one another or work together. The existence of the apostles should be under the Lord's sovereign arrangement, and their existence, relation, and work should keep an excellent order in the Body according to the organic function. My working together with Brother Nee was not according to my choice but was under God's sovereign arrangement. There was always an excellent order between us. I fully realized that according to the organic function in the Body, I should be under him.</P><P>The organic function can be illustrated by our physical body. When one moves his arm, the shoulder, elbow, hand, and fingers move by keeping an excellent order according to their functions. Suppose the fingers would form a conspiracy and say to one another, "Why should we fingers be under the shoulder?" This would be the same as saying that the fingers should be cut off and placed above the shoulder. This would kill the fingers.</P><P>When I came into the work, from the very beginning, all I knew was to labor without any opinion. I realized that I was under Brother Nee according to the organic function in the Body. The dissenting ones who have claimed to be something have cut themselves off. Suppose the eyes said that they no longer wanted to be under the eyebrows. That would be terrible. It not only would destroy their function, but also would destroy the beauty of God's creation. In the Body of Christ a kind of order is spontaneously manifested according to the organic function. This function is not according to any organizational arrangement. Rather, this function is organic. The apostles and all of the saints exist according to God's sovereign arrangement.</P><P>You may feel that the church where you are is too difficult. Because of this, you may consider going to another place. But wherever you go, troubles will be there and hardships will be your portion. There is only one place for you to go&#151;the place under God's sovereign arrangement. Anyone who exercises his choice concerning the place for his existence will receive trouble.</P>
