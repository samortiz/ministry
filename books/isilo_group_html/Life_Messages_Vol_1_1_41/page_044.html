Before we consider various aspects of the way which leads to life, we shall answer a few questions.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>Could you clarify the distinction you made between living by Christ and living Christ?</I><p>I realize that to say &#8220;live Christ&#8221; is grammatically odd, but we had to invent this new term to express what is on our heart. If we are living by Christ, we are still doing the living. To live Christ means that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). When we live, He lives. When He lives, we live.<p><I>Of the four legalities, what does sleeping represent?</I><p>Usually spiritual sleep has a negative sense, but we need to be aware of its positive value also. To sleep means to rest from all activities. It is most healthful to have a time every day of doing nothing. Do not think I mean meditation. Just rest; be free from your thoughts and anxieties. Most of us are too busy, and our minds are too active, worrying about ourselves or the problems in the church. It is hard to make a time to have a spiritual sleep, but if we do, it will make us spiritually healthy. This time is not for praying, not for reading the Word, and not for answering the phone. It is a time set aside just for rest.<p>With all these legalities-eating, breathing, drinking, and sleeping-there is a need for us to exercise a strong will. The will is the only part of our natural being that is useful to the Lord. If we are to keep these legalities and the commandments in the New Testament, we need to ask the Lord to strengthen our will. Gossiping does not take will power, but bringing ourselves to pray and read the Word surely does.<p><I>Sometimes when I am reading the Word or trying to pray, I get bored and fall asleep.</I><p>It is hard for us fallen human beings to stop even for a short while. If we fall asleep, that will stop us. It is good for our health.<p><I>How can we help those who have left the church?</I><p>If the Lord wants us to help some of these dear ones, He will give us a burden, prepare the situation, and afford us the opportunity. There is no need to be distressed. Psalm 127:1 reminds us, &#8220;Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.&#8221; The Lord is the Head. If this is His recovery, His church, nothing can damage it. The Lord told the Jews, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (John 2:19), meaning that when they destroyed His body, He would raise up an even greater one in resurrection.<p><I>Is it all right to submit myself to someone?</I><p>This is a good question. Many great men throughout history submitted themselves to someone or to some idea when they were young. Even if you submit yourself to a wrong person, your submission is still healthy. One who has never submitted himself is raw and of little use. Even materials like iron, copper, and cotton have to be processed before they can be put to use. This is God&#8217;s ordination for us as human beings too. Regrettably, the modern trend is to throw off this principle.<p>As a child, submit to your parents. As a student, submit to your teachers and the other school authorities. If you are working, submit to your employer. To be successful, be successful in your submission! In the church, even if the elders are not so adequate, your position is to submit. This will help your growth. There is more need in the church for submission on the part of the young people.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life Messages, Vol. 1 (#1-41) &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
