   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This anointing also teaches us to deal with people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not criticize a person, but we should definitely know him in order to learn how to associate with him or help him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The common way to accomplish this is to examine a person by observing and studying him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But even this can often lead us the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not say that this is absolutely useless, but it is only secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A pure spirit usually brings the right discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some of us can remember that as children, we could often make very accurate assertions about people we saw.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A long time has passed, and our knowledge, experience, and power of observation have all increased, yet our ability to know people does not seem any better than before.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time we did not know why we made those assertions; something seemed to be in our heart, but we could not utter it with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Time has passed, and everything has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now the facts have proven that our "feeling" was correct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We did not make those assertions through drawn out investigations and inquiries; nor could we even give any evidence or reason for our assertions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the work of a pure intuition even though it is still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, the Lord wants us to regard the things of God in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our spirit should be converted, and we must become as little children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only then will we have the clear knowledge from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us look at the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"And immediately Jesus, knowing fully in His spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves, said to them..."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mark 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse shows us the operation of intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It does not say that the Lord Jesus had a thought or feeling in His heart, nor does it say that the Holy Spirit told Him so.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The faculty of His spirit demonstrated its perfect ability.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sense of the spirit in the man Jesus Christ was very pure, sharp, and exalted; He knew in His spirit the reasonings of the surrounding people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He then spoke to them according to what He had perceived in His intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This should be the normal spiritual life of every spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit; He enables our spirit to be fully operative and full of the power of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way, He regulates our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as the human spirit of the Lord Jesus was working when He was on the earth, our spirit should be working through the Holy Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The knowledge of things through the intuition is what the Bible calls revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation means nothing less than the Holy Spirit revealing the reality of a matter in a believer's spirit and causing him to know such a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is only one kind of knowledge, concerning either the Bible or God, that is worthwhile: it is the truth revealed by the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God does not explain what He is to man's intellect all at once, neither can man know God all at once through his intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter how wise a man's intellect is, and no matter how much he understands about God, his understanding is always veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He can only make inferences with his intellect about the things behind the veil; he does not see the actual things behind the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has not yet "seen," so he can only "understand" and not "know."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Christianity is not a revelation a personal revelation it is worth nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everyone who believes in God must receive His revelation in his spirit; otherwise, he will believe in nothing more than human wisdom, ideals, and words, and not in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of faith will not stand in times of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revelation is not a vision, a voice from heaven, a dream, or an external power which shakes one's body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these may happen to a person without him receiving any revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation is something in the intuition; it is quiet, neither slow nor quick; it appears to be a voice and yet not a voice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people call themselves Christians, yet what they believe in is just human philosophies, ethics, articles of truth, or some supernatural occurrences.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Believing these things will not bring about a new birth; it will not give a person a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although these kind of "Christians" are very numerous today, their spiritual usefulness is altogether nil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God gives grace to all those who have accepted Christ and causes them to see in their spirit the reality of the spiritual realm as if a veil has been removed from before them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Subsequently, what they know is far deeper than what they understood in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The things they understood and perceived in the past seem to have a new meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything is transparent and known for certain because they have "seen" it in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"We speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen" John 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Intellectual pursuit will never save people; only revelation in the spirit will grant men genuine knowledge of God.</S>
