   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From 1950 to 1996, for forty-six years, I have been devoting much more time and energy to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1950, which was the year after I started the work in Taiwan, I had a great determination to build upon the foundation laid by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank the Lord that, for forty-six years, nearly every year He has brought me into some new seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1951 in Taiwan I put out a monthly paper entitled The Ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever I had spoken as messages was published in that paper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That publication lasted for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then from 1960 the Lord began to gradually confirm, both in the environment and in me, that I needed to turn from the Chinese-speaking world to the English-speaking world, that is, to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first time I came to the United States was in 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, I was invited to two places, London in the United Kingdom and Copenhagen in Denmark, for fellowship and conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was traveling to those two places, I passed through the United States in April and stayed until quite close to October before going on to London.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I remained in the United States for four to five months, during which time I had a deep impression concerning the need of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After a year I came back one more time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then at the end of 1961 I came back again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since 1962 I have settled down in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of that year I started my work formally in the United States by holding the first conference, in which I released the series of messages contained in The All-inclusive Christ, based on Deuteronomy 8:7-9 concerning the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not too many people attended the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among them were a few Americans who received and responded to the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I began to receive invitations to different places.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since then I have been working in the United States for over thirty-three years, and the messages that I have released, which number at least three to four thousand, have been published in books.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In these thirty-three years the Lord has led me to see and enter into new light every year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I worship Him that in the last two to three years, ever since I wrote the new hymn "What miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What mystery!/That God and man should blended be!" my speaking has turned into a higher realm.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I knew that Satan would attack me, and at the same time I also knew that I needed such an attack, which was a thorn to my body that I might not become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you have paid attention, you will notice that since that time my messages have changed and have become new.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that all of you brothers will be able to catch up with these new messages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this year's summer training, for example, we had twelve messages on the crystallization-study of the Gospel of John, and in the past we already had fifty-one messages on the life-study of John.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Besides those fifty-one messages, a number of messages on the Gospel of John have been given on many other occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we did the crystallization-study, however, the presentation and the style were altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In my fellowship in the full-time training every Wednesday night, I have a message which I want to share with the trainees concerning Christ as the Son of Man cherishing us in His humanity and Christ as the Son of God nourishing us in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 5 says that Christ cherishes and nourishes the church v. 29 . To cherish is to make people happy and feel pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose when a child is noisy and refuses to eat, the mother tries to amuse him to make him happy this is cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the child is happy, the mother puts the food into his mouth this is nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ came as the Son of Man to cherish us, to make us happy, and then as the Son of God He nourishes us so that we may be satisfied in His life.</S>
