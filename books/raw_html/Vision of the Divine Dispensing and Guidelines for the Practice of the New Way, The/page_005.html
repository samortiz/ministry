<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC UNION OF THE DISPENSING TRIUNE GOD<br>AND THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The Triune God passed through all the processes to become ultimately the life-giving Spirit to be dispensed into all the believers. Through this, the dispensing Triune God is organically joined to all the believers. This union is like the union between the branches of a vine with the vine tree (John 15:5a). The branches of a vine and the tree share the same life and live the same living. The two abide mutually in one another as the result of the life-union (John 15:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC MINGLING<br>OF THE LIFE-DISPENSING GOD<br>WITH THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity results in not only an organic union, but an organic mingling. When we believe into Christ and are regenerated, we receive God's Spirit of life. This Spirit begat in our spirit the pneumatic Christ, so that the Triune God is organically mingled with the regenerated believers (John 3:3-6). By this, the divine attributes of the Triune God&#151;God's love, Christ's grace, and the Spirit's fellowship&#151;are with us (2 Cor. 13:14). Love is the source, grace is the expression, and fellowship is the reaching to us. God's love is simply God Himself as the source of the grace of the Lord. The fellowship of the Spirit is simply the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God dispensed into us for our participation and enjoyment. These are not three separate things, but three aspects of one thing. This is God in His trinity dispensing Himself into the believers.</P><P>Now, God has accomplished this divine dispensing. What glad tidings these are! All things are ready. We can now come to the feast (Luke 14:17) to breathe God in and to eat and drink of God, that is, to breathe in the pneumatic Christ as air, that Christ may be mingled in breath with us for our existence (John 20:22), and to drink of the pneumatic Christ as the living water, that Christ may be mingled organically with us in our living (John 4:10, 14; 7:37-38), and to eat of Christ as our spiritual food in the living word of life, that Christ may be mingled organically with us in life-element (John 6:48, 57b-58a). Hence, whatever we have breathed, drunk, and eaten into us become ours. Not only is it joined to us, but it is mingled with us. In this way, all that God is and has, becomes ours. We have God's life and nature. We also have justification, sanctification, and redemption, together with all the human virtues, such as patience, humility, and obedience.</P><P>As long as we would continually breathe Him in and eat and drink of Him day by day, we will spontaneously grow in the bountiful supply of Christ as the true vine, and we will be bountifully supplied organically in the matter of fruit-bearing (John 15:1, 4-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESULT OF THE BELIEVERS' ENJOYMENT<br>AND APPLICATION OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</H2><P>When we enjoy and apply the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and we are joined outwardly and mingled inwardly with Christ, the following results will be produced: (1) out of us will flow rivers of living water (John 7:37-39); (2) we will bear fruits of life (John 15:1, 4-5); (3) we will be able to feed the lambs in the flock (John 21:15; 10:16); (4) we will become the bride of Christ, His counterpart. This bride as the Body of Christ is His ultimate increase (John 3:6b, 29-30); and (5) we will become the organism of the processed Triune God, which as the universal vine tree in John 15 (vv. 1, 5, 8) becomes the concrete, corporate, and great manifestation of the Triune God.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 19, 1990)</P>
