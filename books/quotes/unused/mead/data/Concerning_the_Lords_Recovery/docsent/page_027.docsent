   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOTHER COMFORTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth He was with twelve disciples, and He had a very intimate time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They lived together, they ate together, they walked together, and they worked together for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The night He was betrayed He told them to their great surprise that He would leave and go away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He told them that if He did not go away He could not be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He had been incarnated, and He was among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this was not His goal, His destination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His goal was to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His destination was not to be among them but within them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He told them that He would go to the cross to be killed, but that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality John 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They had His physical presence temporarily among them and outside of them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But until He was crucified and resurrected, they did not have Him as their reality within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He told them that if He went away, another Comforter would come who is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He would not only be with them but also in them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus as the first Comforter could only be among them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What they needed was a second Comforter, actually just Himself as the Spirit of reality, to come and enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He told them that His going away was His coming to be within them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said, "I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you" John 14:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He went on to say, "In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 16 and 17 say that the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, will be in you, and verse 20 says that I will be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are these two or one?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can figure this out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Bible you do have the divine mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all know that God the Spirit is one, uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in the book of Revelation, God the Spirit is the seven Spirits Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Is God the Spirit seven or one?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is one-seven and seven-one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the divine mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Don't try to figure this out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why Martin Luther indicated that if you fully know the things concerning God, you must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We don't know the things so clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John 14:16-20 says that the second Comforter who is the Spirit of reality will come to be with them and in them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And the Lord said that His coming is My coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So this means that the Lord Himself will come and be in them on the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On that day they would know that He was in the Father, and they were in Him. and He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then who is in whom?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They shouldn't think that He was there without the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even while He was with them, He was in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But they were not in Him yet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the day of resurrection they would know that He was in the Father and that they were in Him, and He was in them v. 20 . When they are in Him, they arc also in the Father, and He is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He is in them. the Father also is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is not only the coexistence among the Three of the Godhead, but also the coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Each is in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can testify that daily and hourly I experience this coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am living in my Lord, and He is in the Father and He is also living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As He is living in me, the Father is also.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all are in this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is for God's expression.</S>
