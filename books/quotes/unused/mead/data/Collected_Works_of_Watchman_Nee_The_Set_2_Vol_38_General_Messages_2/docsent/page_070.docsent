   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ROOT OF OUR ANGER SELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Anger is a common thing, and there are many people who lose their temper easily.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But temper is the most superficial of all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Strictly speaking, it should be dealt with the moment we believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is wrong to see a person with an uncontrollable or unmanageable temper eight or ten years after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So many people lose their temper easily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So many Christians have not dealt with this problem yet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we cannot answer these questions, we cannot be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must understand the reason that a man becomes angry easily before we can find the solution to this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Temper is a big thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet in reading the New Testament, we cannot find the word temper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible does not pay much attention to what we consider as the most common sickness, because temper is not a sickness but the symptom of a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A sickness is one thing, and the symptom of a sickness is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A man may have appendicitis this is a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He may have a fever as well this is a symptom of the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Symptoms are present because a sickness is present.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is useless to try to deal with the symptoms without dealing with the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fever may subside temporarily, but the sickness remains, and after a while the fever will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Temper is not a sickness but the symptom of a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we have to know the root of the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once we know the root, we can get rid of the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the sickness is gone, the symptoms will surely go away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to realize that temper is a symptom and not a root of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is wrong for us to consider temper a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is no wonder that we cannot deal with it, because we consider it as a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many brothers have said that they have a problem with Romans 6:11 because they still cannot overcome their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 6:11 says that we should reckon ourselves to be dead, but many people have a problem applying this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they are about to lose their temper, they hurriedly try to recite Romans 6:11, saying, "I have died, and since I have died, I can no longer lose my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet this is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 6:11 is not about delivering us from the symptoms of sickness but about saving us from the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is useless if we try to apply it to our symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we try to reckon ourselves to be dead when we are about to lose our temper, we will still lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may not lose it outwardly, but we will lose it inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the root of our temper?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The simple answer lies with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man has not dealt with his self, he is heading in the wrong direction if he tries to deal with his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A man loses his temper because of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His self is his sickness; his temper is not his sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because a man has the self, he has temper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the self is dealt with before God, temper will be gone spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the Bible pays attention to the self instead of our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once the problem with the self is solved, the problem with temper is solved as well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as the problem with the self remains, the problem with temper remains.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning the self, there are several things that we should realize.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, some people are very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are subjective are surely full of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They have opinions and concepts for everything, and they think that their concepts and opinions are never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They also constantly insist on their opinions and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They cannot stand any obstacles, frustrations, or breaking down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their opinions must prevail and persist to the end. If anyone does not agree with their proposals or go along with their opinions, their subjective nature has no tolerance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Consequently, they lose their temper and become very angry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, if your eyes are only on your temper, you will never be healed of the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your sickness is your subjectivity and strong will; it is not your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once your subjectivity is broken and your will and opinions are bruised, you will say to the Lord, "Lord, this is Your work, and I submit to You."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you do this, how can you lose your temper again?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you kneel down and say, "Lord, this is Your business; it is Your work" when your proposals are cut off, how can you lose your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It will be impossible for you to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You only have a temper because you insist on your proposals and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you insist on your way of doing things, the self comes out and temper follows.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No one can lose his temper if his self is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The root of your temper lies in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is foolish to spend so much effort to deal with your temper while forgetting to deal with your self.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once a man believes in the Lord, the self must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The self cannot remain whole before the Lord, and it is not worth keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a man is free from the self, he will not lose his temper even when he is interrupted, frustrated, or tried.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Second, some people have a temper because they think they are better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They think highly of themselves and think that they are superb.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, they are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everyone who is proud not only considers himself higher than others, but also demands that others admire and regard him highly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No proud person is satisfied with just having a high regard for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is not content with just himself saying that he is good; he wants others to say that he is good.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A proud person is not content with self-admiration; he wants everyone to admire him and the brothers and sisters to exalt him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If another brother does not appreciate his "worthiness," his "importance," or his high "spiritual attainment" or does not speak marvelously of him, he feels hurt and becomes angry!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Where is the source of this anger?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It comes from pride.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A man becomes angry because he is proud.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brothers and sisters, if you remove your pride, you will remove your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is impossible to remove one's temper without first removing his pride.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The root of temper is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You will not lose your temper if you are a humble person in the eyes of God, if you consider others' jesting, despising, and slandering as the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and if you accept this disciplining work, saying, "Lord, this is all for my own good; these things have happened to me because You want to deal with my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Lord, I thank You for Your perfecting work in these things."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then when a brother does not obey and instead damages your standing, you will feel that pride is wrong and that it is all right to be hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you do this, you will not lose your temper; rather, you will say to the Lord, "It is right for You to deal with my pride."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you know God's hand, you will not lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Brothers and sisters, temper is not a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If you deal with temper as if you were dealing with a sickness, you will never succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You have to learn to prostrate yourself before the Lord and say, "You can do whatever You want."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you put your self aside and are willing to deny and deal with your self, you will see that your strength to lose your temper will be gone, your motivation to lose your temper will be gone, and your temper will lose its grip.</S>
