This is not merely the fullness of the Father, nor of the Son, nor of the Spirit; this is the fullness of God, the fullness of the Divine Trinity. How wonderful! How glorious! This is an outline of Ephesians 3, a chapter which is full of the divine dispensing, transmission, union, and mingling, and ultimately the accomplishing of God&#8217;s economy and the producing of a corporate expression.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD IN EPHESIANS 4</h2><p>In chapter four we see the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father. In chapter one, it is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; in chapter two, it is the Son, the Spirit, and the Father; in chapter three, it is the Father, the Spirit, and the Son; and in chapter four, it is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father. In 4:3-6 Paul mentions seven &#8220;ones&#8221;: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all. This portion indicates that the Son comes from the Father for us to believe in, to receive, and to enter into, and the result is that we become His Body. The One who dwells in this Body is the Spirit, who is the ultimate manifestation of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hence, the ultimate manifestation of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwells in a corporate habitation, which is the Body as the expression of the Triune God.<p>Now we see that the dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in the one Body, in which dwells the Spirit as the ultimate manifestation of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Moreover, eventually, the Body is the expression of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In brief, the Triune God&#8217;s economy is to dispense and transmit Himself into us, His believers, and to continuously unite and mingle Himself with us that we may become His one Body as His corporate expression.<h2 class=head1>THE CORPORATE EXPRESSION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>All of us who serve the Lord must see this matter. In all of our messages, words, truths, and preaching, we should take this as the starting point, the content, and the destination. We must show people that according to His economy, the Triune God is working Himself into us-dispensing, transmitting, uniting, and mingling Himself with us-producing the one Body, which includes humanity, divinity, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.<p>This is a mystery as well as an aggregate. In John 15 this mystery is the universal true vine; furthermore, in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two of Revelation, the last book written by John, the aggregate is the New Jerusalem. In John 15 we see the universal true vine; in Revelation 21-22 the universal true vine is the New Jerusalem. The Triune God is producing an organism through His dispensing, transmitting, uniting, and mingling to express Himself for the accomplishment of His eternal economy.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
