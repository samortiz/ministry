   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Himself, Christ, and even we human beings are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do not even know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must simply believe that God created us with a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moreover, God is Spirit, and He became incarnated, putting on flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then He died, was buried, and in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we believed in Him, He entered into our spirit as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now the Spirit works together with our spirit, and the two spirits have become one to such an extent that it is difficult to discern which is which.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not know our spirit, we cannot live a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Christian life is altogether a life in our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must not analyze, convince ourselves, or try to convince others that we have these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must exercise our faith based upon what is written in the holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In expressing his opinion concerning marriage, Paul said, "But I think that I also have the Spirit of God" 1 Cor 7:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He may not have felt the Spirit, and he had no way to prove that he had the Spirit, but he thought he had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must not be influenced by the teaching that we must pray and do many things before we can receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should simply take the Word and exercise our spirit to believe what the Word says.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must forget about whether or not we have a certain feeling that we have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must have the assurance that we are acting, behaving, and even having our being in our spirit, but it is hard to tell if we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is easier to know when we are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we lose our temper, we know that is in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are so logical and philosophical, we know that is in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are not in the spirit, we know it, but when we are in the spirit, we do not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This may be illustrated by the organs of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When there is no problem with our stomach, we are not aware of it, but when our stomach has a problem, we are aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not to know is a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are certain that we know something in our spirit, this may indicate that we are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To say of a certainty that we are in the spirit is not a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The apostle John did say, "I was in spirit on the Lord's day" Rev 1:10 , but he said it by faith, not by feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When John was in exile on the island of Patmos, his entire being was concentrated on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Surely he was in the spirit, but this does not mean that he had the feeling that he was in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had the fact, and he told us the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also can say that we are in our spirit, not because we feel it, but because we believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must learn not to trust in our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it is better to believe more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul said, "That Christ may make His home in your heart through faith" Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We know that Christ is making His home in our hearts not by feeling but through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is altogether a matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As believers in Christ, we must believe that we have a human spirit and that it has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also have the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, and the two spirits are one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, in many verses in the New Testament, we cannot discern whether "spirit" denotes the divine Spirit or the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It simply denotes the wonderful mingled spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This wonderful spirit consists of our spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In experience we must be blind and simply exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible says it is so, so we say it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have a spirit, and the divine Spirit mingles with our human spirit and is one spirit with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot analyze this; we can only believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We simply must do our duty to live, act, move, do things, and have our being in our spirit.</S>
