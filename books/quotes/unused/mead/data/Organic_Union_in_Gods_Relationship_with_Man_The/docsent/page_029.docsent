   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROWTH OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Through the Members Growing into the Head, Christ, in All Things by Holding to Truth in Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The growth of the Body of Christ is through the members growing into the Head, Christ, in all things by holding to truth in love Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We, the members of Christ, must grow into the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can be a Christian, a member of Christ, and yet have many aspects in which we are not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our gossiping, our reasoning, our murmuring, and our arguing are all outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult to deal with the young people concerning their talking on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If their parents ask them to do something, they may say, "I have no time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am busy."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After a short time the telephone may ring, and one of them may answer it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After a while one of the parents may inform this one that he needs to use the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The young one may respond by saying that he will be on the telephone for only another five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, five minutes turns into fifty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is that kind of talking on the telephone in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to grow into Christ, particularly in the matter of using the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am the same as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I like to talk to people on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But while I am speaking on the telephone, my Partner within me often says, "It is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Stop."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word stop is continually being spoken within me while I am speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My response to the One within me is: "Just one more minute."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But my Partner continues to say, "Stop."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After such a telephone call, I need ten minutes to make a confession: "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I deliberately sinned against You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You were within me stopping me, checking with me, but I would not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I lied to You more than ten times by saying that I would stop in just one minute, but I did not keep my word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a sinner I am!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a confession could not easily be forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thereafter, if another telephone call comes, I am fearful and even trembling that I may speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way I learned the lesson of growing, particularly in the matter of handling telephone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also need to consider the matters of gossiping, reasoning, and murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Each day how much time do we spend gossiping?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some saints are very free in passing on information about others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Too much time has been wasted and too many dollars have been spent in talking vainly on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In such activities we have been outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this kind of situation it is impossible to have the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need the building up in Christ and the building up into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Very often I do not have the freedom to speak certain things even to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The One who restricts me is my Partner, Christ, who is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not have the freedom to tell my wife everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I tell my wife some unnecessary thing, my talk becomes gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This question rises up within me when I speak to my wife about another brother: "Why do you have to tell your wife about this brother?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is it for shepherding or for taking care of the saints?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If it is for shepherding, it may be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But quite often the matter of shepherding is used as an excuse, a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our appetite may not be for shepherding or taking care of the saints; rather, our taste may be to talk about others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may even tell our wife to keep something we have said about another brother confidential, yet we must realize that such a saying cannot be kept confidential.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we had not given the charge of confidentiality to our wife, she might have been slow to tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But because of our charge, what we have said will be spread to various places.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, I learned the lesson: To grow into Christ, do not speak about others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church life, the saints' gossiping, reasoning, and debating have wasted much time and money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Concerning the vital groups, we have charged the saints to go out to visit people two hours a week.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To budget two hours every week to go out may seem to be very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if we add together all the time spent on the telephone in one week, we may discover that we have spent more than two hours on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My burden is not to minister doctrines to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My desire is to transfuse you with the very Christ whom I have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I am on the telephone, He is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As I am talking to the other party, He is instructing me within.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then after the telephone conversation, many times I have to kneel down to confess to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is my real experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Ephesians 4:15, the members of the Body grow up into Christ in all things by holding to truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this verse the word truth refers to anything that is real.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By this word alone I have learned that many telephone calls are not true.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is much vain talk on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such talk is vanity, not truth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is truth?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is truth, Christ is truth, the Spirit is truth, the divine life is truth, the Body of Christ is truth, the gospel is truth, and salvation is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By holding to these true things, we grow into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we hold to these real things, we are actually growing into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Otherwise, we are not growing into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Dear saints, if this word impresses you and you take it, practice it, and live it, you will receive much blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It will save you time and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead of speaking vainly about others, it is better for you to shut your eyes and sit down to rest awhile in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The amount of time you spend talking vanity can be used to sit before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You do not even need to speak to the Lord; just sit with Him and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you try this, you will have the real growth into the Head in all things, by holding to truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The phrase in love is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we speak something to others in vanity, this indicates that we do not love the Lord and we do not love the one of whom we are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not have the right to expose others, but we still expose them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Instead of exposing others' mistakes, we should cover them, not telling anyone about them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is love 1 Pet 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Yet we are just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We like to tell people about others, exposing them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To inform is not to love.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To love is to cover others' shortcomings and weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>To talk in vanity to everyone indicates that we do not love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The church has been damaged very much by this kind of exposing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If everyone in a church refrains from exposing others and is full of prayers, singing, and praises to the Lord, that church is beautiful.</S>
