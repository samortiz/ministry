[1]  The Living that Fulfills God s Eternal Purpose CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE REALIZATION OF THE BODY LIFE PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN
[3]  Moreover, the secret to putting off the old man and putting on the new man is to be renewed in the spirit of our mind v. 23 . The more we are renewed in our mind by the spreading of our spirit into our mind, the more we will put off the old man and put on the new man, the more we will realize the church life, and the more we will realize the Body of Christ.
[4]  Since the new man is the Body of Christ, the church, in the Body of Christ there is nothing but Christ Himself.
[5]  From that time on, God desires that we live by Christ John 6:57; Phil 1:21a , walk in Christ Col 2:6 , and take Christ as everything to us as knowledge, wisdom, light, energy, strength, power, and many other items v. 3; 1 Cor 1:30; John 8:12; Phil 4:13; Eph 6:10 . This requires that we give up the old man, deny our self, and put off the old nature.
[6]  If we deny our self and live by Christ, that is, if we put off the old man and put on the new man by putting on Christ as life and as everything to us Rom 13:14 , there will be no need to talk about unity, because we will already be in the oneness of the church.
[7]  When we are in Christ, taking Christ as our life and experiencing Him in a living way, we are in the oneness, because the reality of the oneness of the church is Christ Himself.
[8]  Question: Recently you gave us the main point of the books of 1 and 2 Chronicles, which is that no one can work by his own power, ability, or wisdom.
[9]  Answer: We have to look at this portion of the Word with the view of the entire Scriptures, from beginning to end. The Scriptures reveal to us that God s intention in this universe is to have His house, His dwelling place, built up among the human race.
[10]  The church is a new creation created by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, and is actually Christ Himself realized within us 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 2:14-16; Gal 6:15 .
[11]  Question: Is there no need of struggling or discipline?
[12]  Answer: In the experience of the cross, the more we struggle, the more we turn the cross away from us.
[13]  However, if we are always willing to give up our self, telling the Lord, Lord, I am ready to give up my mind and my emotion in everything, and I will also pay the price to give up my will in everything, there will be no need for discipline.
[14]  It is Christ Himself as the Spirit whom we must realize, and any group of believers who meet together as an expression of the Body of Christ must be living and full of Christ.
[15]  Question: If we want to meet on the church ground, gather around the Lord s table, and be led freely by the Spirit, and if we extend open fellowship to all, but others do not come, where do we stand?
[16]  Answer: In today s situation everything is complicated and confused, but we do not take responsibility for this.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO THE EXERCISE OF OUR HUMAN SPIRIT THE THREE PARTS OF MAN
[18]  Concerning the creation of man, Genesis 2:7 says, Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.
[19]  When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we were regenerated in our spirit.
[20]  When our spirit was regenerated, the Holy Spirit of God came into our spirit to enliven it and bring the Lord Jesus Christ into it as life.
[21]  According to the human life in our soul, we are human beings and sons of men, and according to the divine life in our spirit, we are children of God and sons of God.
[22]  Because we have two lives, the soulish life and the divine life, there are always two ways for us as Christians to do things.
[23]  We can do things by the human life in our soul or by the divine life in our spirit.
[24]  The way to live for the Lord, following and obeying Him, is to not exercise our soul our mind, emotion, and will but to exercise our spirit.
[25]  We have the assurance that in these last days, before He comes back, the Lord will recover Christ as life and the church as His expression, not by a movement or a revival but by the fellowship of the Body of Christ and the current of life.
[26]  It is an eternal plan made in Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and for Christ according to God s desire and pleasure vv.
[27]  Now let us consider who Christ is as the content of the vessel.
[28]  Without Christ, God is truly a mystery, and no one can understand Him.
[29]  Then when we consider something, we will consider it in the same way that Christ does; when we love someone or something, we will love in the same way, manner, attitude, and atmosphere as Christ loves, and in our love we will sense the taste of Christ; and when we decide something, it will be Christ s decision, for there will be the element of Christ in our decision.
[30]  Question: How can we apply Christ as you have described?
[31]  Prayer: Lord, we look to You that You would open to us Yourself with Your Word.
[32]  In these messages we are covering the line of Christ as life and the church, the Body of Christ, as the expression of Christ.
[33]  We Christians always try to do things and work for the Lord, but the Lord wants us to eat Him and drink Him by enjoying Him and feeding on Him.
[34]  We need a revelation that God s eternal purpose, His ultimate intention, is to mingle Himself with us and work Himself into us.
[35]  Question: Galatians 6:2 says, Bear one another s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ completely.
[36]  How and in what attitude should we bear one another s burdens, and what is the law of Christ and its fulfillment?
[37]  15-16 , in the second chapter Christ is living in us v. 20 , in the third chapter Christ is our clothing v. 27 , in the fourth chapter Christ is formed in us v. 19 , and in the fifth chapter we are not separated from Christ vv.
[38]  A new creation is a person who is mingled with Christ, a person who has Christ revealed in him, Christ living in him, Christ covering him as his clothing, Christ being formed in him, and Christ being a fountain of life within him.
[39]  This is why he wrote of God revealing His Son in him, of Christ living in him, of his putting on Christ as his clothing, of Christ being formed in him, of his not being separated from Christ but keeping himself in Christ, and of Christ flowing out of him to bear the fruit of the Spirit.
[40]  Although it is true that Christ is the Head, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Lord, and everything to the church, the central thought is that Christ is life to the church.
[41]  If we keep the pictures at the two ends of the Scriptures before us as we read the Scriptures, we will see that the entire Scriptures deal with nothing but Christ as life for God s building.
[42]  Christ is life for the purpose of producing the materials that will be built up as a spiritual building, a spiritual house.
[43]  This spiritual house is the Body of Christ as a dwelling place to God and a bride to Christ.
[44]  The central thought of the Scriptures is that we must receive Christ as life and experience Christ as life so that we will first be regenerated, then transformed to be the precious materials for the building, and then built up together Eph 2:22; 4:12, 16; 1 Pet 2:5 .
[45]  We must be responsible to receive Christ, apply Christ, and appropriate Christ to ourselves as life that we may be regenerated, transformed into precious materials, and built up together with others as the Body of Christ, which is God s dwelling place and Christ s bride.
[46]  Question: Can you tell us more about the process of transformation?
[47]  CHAPTER SIX THE CHURCH AS THE INCREASE OF CHRIST
[48]  John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
[49]  According to this verse, the real meaning of regeneration is to be born of the Holy Spirit in our human spirit.
[50]  Christ is the Bridegroom, the One who has the bride, and the bride is the church of Christ.
[51]  God s eternal purpose is to work Christ into us, to have Christ wrought into us, and to make Christ life to us.
[52]  If we experience Christ as life, automatically we will have the church life; we will realize the life of the Body of Christ, the church.
[53]  But the more we live by Christ, take Christ as our life, and experience Christ as life, the more we will desire to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters and to be related with other Christians.
[54]  Only the Christ who enters into us and is born in us to be our life, only the Christ who lives Himself out and expresses Himself through us only this Christ is the reality of the church.
[55]  It is the bride who will marry Christ as His counterpart to match Him.
[56]  In order to realize the genuine church life, we need to put off the old man, which is our self, our soulish life, by rejecting our mind, emotion, and will, and we need to put on the new man, which is Christ with the church and the church with Christ.
[57]  To be renewed in the spirit of our mind means that all our old concepts must be given up, and we must have an absolutely new concept; that is, we must have the mind of the Holy Spirit, the mind of Christ 1 Cor 2:16 , a mind that is filled with our regenerated human spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit 6:17 , and is under the control of our spirit.
[58]  Question: Do you believe that a division exists between those who deny the self and those who do not?
[59]  Answer: Actually, the more we deny our self, the more we will be related with others, not only with those who deny themselves but also with those who do not deny themselves.
[60]  If we are not seeking and experiencing Christ as our life, and if it is not Christ in us who energizes us and makes us clear concerning God s will, we should not leave our denomination.
[61]  In this chapter we will consider the matter of being in the spirit.
[62]  In order to see this matter, first we need to realize that the Bible reveals that there are two spirits: the divine Spirit, that is, God Himself, and the human spirit, that is, our spirit.
[63]  John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.
[64]  We may worship and serve God, but many of us simply do not realize that the God whom we worship and serve is a Spirit.
[65]  Since God is Spirit, if we desire to contact God, the divine Spirit, we must contact Him in and with our spirit.
[66]  This verse says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.
[67]  According to this verse we know that we are children of God because there is an inner witness within us.
[68]  When the Lord Spirit came into our spirit to enliven our spirit and to regenerate our spirit with Christ as life, the two spirits, the Lord Spirit and our spirit, were mingled as one and were joined as one spirit.
[69]  We also need to see what our spirit is and what the difference is between our spirit and our mind, emotion, will, and heart.
[70]  First Thessalonians 5:23 says, The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[71]  Now we need to consider practically what person we are living by today.
[72]  If we live by the soul, we are soulish men, but if we live by the spirit, we are spiritual men.
[73]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE PRIESTHOOD Scripture Reading: Exo 19:6; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rev 1:5b-6, 9; 20:6; 22:3 GOD S INTENTION AND THE PRIESTHOOD
[74]  In this universe God has an administration, in which is His divine economy.
[75]  God s economy is His household economy, His household administration Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4 , which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church 3:15 , the Body of Christ.
[76]  SOME EXAMPLES OF THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE BIBLE Adam
[77]  We have pointed out that the priesthood is not any kind of service in which we do something or work for God.
[78]  The priesthood is a group of persons who are filled with God, saturated and permeated by and with God, and one with God, and out of whom God Himself is flowing.
[79]  When I began to serve the Lord, I liked to talk with people about working for the Lord.
[80]  Now I have no appetite for this because I have seen that it is not a matter of working for the Lord but a matter of being filled with Him, taken over by Him, possessed by Him, and saturated and permeated by and with Him.
