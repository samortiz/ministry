<h1 class="title">PICTURE VERSUS REALITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:9; 6:4; 7:6; 8:2, 4; 12:11; John 5:39-40</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLD TESTAMENT BEING A PICTURE</h2>
<p>The Old Testament is full of types and figures, pictures given to man from God. In the New Testament God spoke to man in plain words. The Jews, however, did not understand that the Old Testament was merely a picture needing the plain words of the New Testament to bring in the reality of the picture. The Jews have the picture and want only the Old Testament; they do not have the plain words, nor do they want the New Testament. This desire for the Old Testament became a problem to the Jews because they have an empty picture lacking reality, a picture that gradually became ordinances. The many items in the Old Testament picture portray the facts in the New Testament, but each item has become an ordinance because it lacks plain words to bring in reality.</p>
<p>Each ordinance in the Bible is a brush stroke in the picture. When man has the reality that comes with plain words, the brush strokes are not ordinances. Without the reality that comes with plain words, every brush stroke in the picture is an ordinance that man sees and keeps. A picture of an ear is not a real ear, a picture of a nose is not a real nose, and pictures of two eyes and two arms are not real eyes or real arms. Every brush stroke is empty and dead if the picture lacks reality and life. Therefore, without the reality brought forth by the New Testament, the entire Old Testament is empty and dead, because without reality, life, and the Spirit it is a picture of ordinances.</p>
<p>John 5:39 and 40 show this principle. In verse 39 the Lord said to the Jews, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life.&rdquo; The Jews thought, or believed, that the Scriptures contained eternal life. Although such a thought is right, it is also wrong. The Scriptures contain pictures of life but not the reality of life. Hence, the Lord Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;It is these that testify concerning Me.&rdquo; The word <em>testify</em> can be understood as &ldquo;portray.&rdquo; Hence, the Lord seemed to say, &ldquo;It is these that portray Me.&rdquo; In verse 40 the Lord continued, &ldquo;Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.&rdquo; The Jews searched the Scriptures, thinking that the Scriptures contained eternal life; however, the Scriptures were but a portrayal of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord wanted the Jews to come to Him for life. <em>Scriptures</em> in verse 39 refers to the Old Testament, and <em>come to Me</em> in verse 40 refers to the New Testament. The New Testament is Christ. People search the Scriptures, believing that the Scriptures contain eternal life. There is eternal life in the Scriptures, because the Scriptures portray, describe, and testify concerning the Lord. However, if we search the Scriptures but do not come to the Lord, we will obtain only the picture; we will not obtain the reality of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSSIBILITY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
ALSO BEING A PICTURE</h2>
<p>We must see a principle: the Old Testament is a portrayal, a picture, of Christ, and the New Testament can also become a portrayal, a picture, of Christ without the reality of life. It is possible for us to make the mistake of the Jews by searching the Scriptures but not being willing to come to the Lord in order to have life. To search the Scriptures is to open the Scriptures, to read them with our eyes, to apprehend them with our mind, and to admire them with our heart. This is right, good, and proper. However, if we stop with mere understanding and do not come to the Lord to have life, we will be one step short.</p>
<p>Since 1966 the Lord has been impressing us with the need to pray-read the Word. If we only read, think, understand, and apprehend when coming to the Word, then we will obtain only the picture. We need to pray-read so that in addition to reading with our eyes and apprehending with our mind, we also come to the Lord with our spirit and touch Him with our spirit.</p>
<p>A person may study and understand electricity, but unless he connects an electrical appliance to a power source and switches on the appliance, he will not have electricity. He may research books on electricity, but unless he is willing to receive electricity, he will not have electricity. Although the Bible speaks of life and explains life, we must come to Christ in order to have life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus spoke this word to the Jewish religionists. It should have been easy for the Jews to come to the Lord. They should have said, &ldquo;Lord, now we understand. The Old Testament is but a picture; You are the reality of the Old Testament. We do not want to know only the picture; we want to worship You. You are the Lord, and You are God. We want to be like Peter, John, and Andrew to contact You, follow You, and walk with You.&rdquo; Actually, Peter and John followed the Lord for three and a half years, but they did not have life during that time, because the Lord had not yet entered into them. Peter and John followed the Lord for three and a half years, but even what they had was only a picture, a portrait. Their walk with the Lord was an outward imitation. When the Lord went up to the mountain, they also went up. Nonetheless, no matter what they did with the Lord Jesus, He had not entered into them. The Lord was the Lord, and they were they. The Lord had not yet become their life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
