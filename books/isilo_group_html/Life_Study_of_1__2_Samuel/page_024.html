As a Man of Prayer</H2><P>Fifth, Samuel ministered as a man of prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Praying for God's Elect, the Children of Israel</H2><P>Samuel prayed for God's elect, the children of Israel (7:3-14; 8:6; 15:11b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. For Them to Be Kept in the Way of God</H2><P>Samuel prayed for the children of Israel to be kept in the way of God, to be one with God, not to be ensnared by the idols of the nations, and to enjoy God as Eben-ezer, which means "the stone of help." "Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen; and he called its name Eben-ezer and said, Thus far Jehovah has helped us" (7:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. That God's Desire of His Will<br>in His Elect Might Be Fulfilled</H2><P>Samuel prayed for God's elect that God's desire of His will in His elect might be fulfilled. Up to this day God has helped us, but why has He helped us? God has helped us that His desire might be fulfilled. We need to realize that God's helping us is for His fulfillment of His economy and that we are enjoying the blessing in this fulfillment. Today God is blessing us in every way for the fulfillment of His economy to build up the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In Samuel's Consideration,<br>Ceasing to Pray for God's Elect<br>Being to Sin against Jehovah</H2><P>In Samuel's consideration, ceasing to pray for God's elect was to sin against Jehovah (12:23). We also need to pray for God's people. In particular, the co-workers and elders need to pray for the churches every day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God Admitting to Jeremiah<br>That Samuel, like Moses, Was a Man<br>Standing before Him for His People</H2><P>God admitted to Jeremiah that Samuel, like Moses, was a man standing before Him for His people (Jer. 15:1). Moses was a priest, a prophet (Deut. 18:15, 18), and a judge, and he always prayed for God's people. In these matters Samuel was the same. He was a priest, a prophet, and a judge who prayed for God's people. In the Old Testament, only Moses and Samuel were qualified to participate fully in the priesthood, the prophethood, and the judgeship.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Samuel &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
