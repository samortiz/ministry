<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSON OF NOT SPEAKING LOOSELY</h2>
<p>May the Lord cover me with His blood. I have been serving with the brothers for several decades, and none of you, whether in Taiwan or abroad, have ever heard me say anything loosely. I have never said that a certain place is good or that another place is not good. I have never said that Japan is good or that Korea is good. The elders and especially the co-workers must learn the lesson of not speaking loosely, regardless of where they are. If they can refrain from speaking too much, regardless of where they are, their work will surely be successful. One who speaks much cannot help people, but one who speaks little is able to render the most help to people.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago when I was in Shanghai, there were five co-workers, of whom I was the last to arrive. One day, one of the co-workers was about to travel to another place. Because of this he went to Brother Nee and asked him, saying, &ldquo;A certain place has invited me to work, but I do not know what to do.&rdquo; Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;You simply need to do one thing, that is, to say &lsquo;I do not know.&rsquo;&rdquo; This means that when someone asks us what he should do regarding a certain matter, we should have only one answer: &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; Later, another person may ask the same question. To him we should also give the same answer: &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most people may wonder how a person can carry out a work if he does not know anything. Actually, we need to realize that we can help people the most when we truly do not know anything; if we know everything, we will not be able to help others. For instance, if we have the answer regardless of whether people ask us about the east or the west, or about our mother-in-law or our daughter-in-law, we will be useless in God&rsquo;s hand. Some co-workers are like this; in the end they have no usefulness in God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>A good doctor does not give people a diagnosis casually. Doctors with special skills often sense their own inadequacy. Although they are very familiar with their own specialty, they sense that their knowledge is limited to certain matters, to a special field. If they encounter other problems, they are aware of the need to consult and discuss with doctors in the relevant fields. Those who do so are good doctors. Those who think that they know everything are &ldquo;medical quacks.&rdquo; Those who have not studied medicine thoroughly often think that they know everything, yet those who have studied medicine more thoroughly rarely say that they know anything; they often say that they do not know. When the co-workers go out, they must have this kind of attitude: &ldquo;I do not know; I have learned so little.&rdquo; Even if we really know something, unless we are in our own place, that is, unless we are in our own &ldquo;car&rdquo; and we are the one &ldquo;driving,&rdquo; we should not say anything. We need this kind of attitude and learning to work for the Lord.</p>
<p>We fellowship these points with the hope that we will all learn this lesson. We should not only pay attention to how to carry out the students&rsquo; work or to how well we do it; rather, we need to pay attention to the matter of the cross, put it in our heart, and learn this lesson together. If we learn this lesson well, our work with the students will surely succeed; however, if the students&rsquo; work is not successful, it is not because the way is not good but because our learning is inadequate.</p>
<p>We should labor and take the lead according to this principle and continue to keep this principle by giving everyone the full opportunity, enlightening them, and inspiring their organic function. Whether it is the work with the college, high school, or junior high school students, the first group of people we can and should use is the existing brothers and sisters who are students. For instance, we can list all the colleges and universities and see how many brothers and sisters we have in each of these schools. Then we need to motivate them and help them to function. If there are fifty brothers and sisters in the National Taiwan University, the first thing we should do is to motivate them to labor on their university. After motivating them, we should see how many full-time trainee brothers and sisters are needed to cooperate with them and strengthen them. If we begin in this way and follow this principle, I believe that the students&rsquo; work will be successful.</p>
<p>For over three years we have been studying the way for the church to gain the increase and have seen that door-knocking gains people, the home meetings keep people, the group meetings join people together, and the district meetings bring people into the church. The principle is the same with the students&rsquo; work. We need to visit people and gain people directly on the campuses. Then we need to keep them by the principle of the home meetings. Although the students do not have homes, we must find a way, based on this principle, to keep them. Then we need to use the group meetings to join them with others. Finally, we can use the district meetings to bring them into the church. While the work of gaining people is done on the campuses, we still need to bring the new believers to attend the district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day so that they can taste the church life and have some knowledge and feeling for the church. Whether it is the campus work or any other work, we may have all kinds of activities during the week, but we must bring the new ones to the church meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. I am presenting some principles, but there is still the need for the elders to study concerning the details. If we are able to practice these points well, we will succeed.</p>
