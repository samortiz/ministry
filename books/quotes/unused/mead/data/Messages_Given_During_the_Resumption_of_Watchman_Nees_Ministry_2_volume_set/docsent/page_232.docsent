   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"WAS PASSING THROUGH"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JESUS COMING TO THE SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 says, "And He...was passing through Jericho."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The words "passing through" are excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus passed through Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He passed through Europe, Asia, Shanghai, and Wen-teh Li.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, His Spirit is here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His name is here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We who believe in Him are also here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you feel something moving within you, it means that He has come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 1 says, "...was passing through."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here is a question of time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was passing through.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It does not say that He had passed through, or that He will pass through, but that He was then passing through.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was a man whose name was Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps you are that man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This man Zaccheus was a government officer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet he was not a clean officer, but a corrupt officer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was a chief tax-collector.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was also a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His social standing was not a noble one, for he was a chief tax-collector involved in extortion and bribery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, some people's educational standings are not noble, for they only graduated from high school, yet they have received a college diploma through unrighteous means.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These diplomas are not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is your house clean?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is your social standing clean?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, are you clean with respect to your marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How is your marriage life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our lives were being investigated, none of us would be found noble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one would be found clean, and no one would be found moral.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this cursed city, there were not very many moral people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To say that there were not very many is too nice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually there were none.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where there are rich men, there is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where there is money, there is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have not sinned, where did your money come from?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This man made a lot of money, but spent very little.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He might even be receiving money without spending anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a traitor among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He would not sacrifice one single hair of his for others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He made himself rich through the power of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man is not mean, he cannot be a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All rich people are mean people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While others may be dying of hunger, they still hold tightly to their purse strings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"SEEKING TO SEE JESUS"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>ALL THOSE COMING TO HIM AND</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>CALLING ON HIM BEING SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Zaccheus was a small man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was not tall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was short, both morally and physically as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was afraid of seeing many things, but he was not afraid of seeing Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I was between twenty and twenty-one years old, I traveled once to Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the boat, some people were playing with a Ouija board.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I wanted to take a look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the people were afraid that I was a Christian and would not allow me to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our Lord Jesus, however, is not afraid of being seen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He likes to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will not hide Himself away from anyone who comes to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man would come and see Jesus, His love, grace, and blessing will come to such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Peking, there was an old man who once said that Jesus was not as good as Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Later we had a gospel meeting, and his relatives brought him to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the meeting, the preacher prayed for the sick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who could not sit down were able to sit down after the preacher prayed, and those who could not stand were able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This old man prayed to the Lord in his heart, "Although I am sick, I do not ask You to heal my sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I only ask You to forgive my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When he prayed this way, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After the meeting, he was walking on the street, and he heard traveling troupes singing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was his favorite pastime.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But that day when he heard that sound, he did not feel that his heart was drawn to it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Later he began meeting with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Zaccheus saw Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Jesus was surrounded by many people, but Zaccheus was still able to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today, many people see only the backslidden Christians and those who do not have a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They do not see Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These people have been hindered by the surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Zaccheus was a dwarf.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today there are many dwarfs.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you cannot understand the Bible, it means that your spirit is dwarfed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many people are spiritually deaf; they cannot hear God's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today, Jesus is here, yet you do not see Him, because your spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The crowd who thronged around Him could not see Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you want to see Jesus, you have to "run on ahead."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You have to call on Him by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The first thing Zaccheus did was to run, and the second thing he did was to climb.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The meaning of climbing is to overcome the difficulties in the circumstances and the natural environment.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A Man called Jesus was there.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Zaccheus had never seen Jesus before.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If he had seen Him before, he would not have needed to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Actually, if he wanted to know who Jesus was, he could just shout, "Who is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Please lift up your head."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But strange to say, he did not call.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>On the contrary, Jesus lifted up His head and called to him, "Zaccheus!"</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Zaccheus was bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>How could this stranger know him?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>How Zaccheus was touched!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord Jesus said, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house" Luke 19:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>How could the Lord say this?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is because He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He knows everything.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>No one who is willing to see Jesus will miss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If you see your own sins, and if you know that the Lord can deliver you out of your sins, and you call on Him, He will surely save you.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If you come to Jesus, and if you behold Him and call on Him, you will surely meet Him within you.</S>
