[1]  Prophesying in the Church Meetings for the Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ Outlines CONTENTS
[2]  OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rev 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Matt 16:18; Eph 4:8; 1:1-16; Col 2:19; 1 Cor 14:3-5, 12, 23a, 24, 26, 31a The Lord is recovering four major items in the advance of His recovery today: The Lord desires to recover the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament: The beginning of the priesthood in the New Testament was with John the Baptist Mark 1:1-4: Preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins as the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[3]  The Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12, 16: The Body of Christ is an organism of the Triune God as the issue of the divine Trinity, not an organization of human beings Eph 1; John 15:1-5.
[4]  OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:11-12; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:3-5, 26 The organic way to practice the Lord s present recovery for the organic building up of the Body of Christ: The organic preaching of the gospel saving sinners by contacting them where they are: God s pattern in the Old Testament: Coming to find and visit fallen man Gen 3:8-9 , preaching the gospel to fallen man 3:15 , and ministering salvation to the condemned man 3:21 .
[5]  In the Gospels, the only clear word concerning the building up of the church is in Matthew 16:18; in the Epistles, 1 Corinthians and Ephesians are the two particular books on the building up of the church as the Body of Christ: Matthew 16:18 is fulfilled by practicing the revelation of Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26.
[6]  On the one hand, 1 Corinthians 14:26 is fulfilled by practicing the revelation in Ephesians 4:11-16; on the other hand, unless the meetings of mutuality as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 are recovered in the practice of the church life, it is impossible to practice the building up of the Body of Christ as recorded in Ephesians 4:11-16.
[7]  When we enter into the practice of the truth revealed in Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord will have a way to work out His New Testament economy to recover the organic building up of the church and to prepare the bride for Christ: Ephesians 4:11-16 tells us that the church as the Body of Christ is not built up by the gifted persons directly; their work is to perfect the saints so that the saints can directly build up the Body of Christ: Ephesians 4:11-16 reveals three levels of building: Christ, the Head of His Body, builds up the Body Matt 16:18 by giving gifted persons as the joints to the Body Eph 4:11, 16 .
[8]  God s family plan, God s family administration, is to distribute, to dispense, all the divine riches in Christ into His saved ones for their nourishment and feeding, resulting in the building up of the Body of Christ.
[9]  The excelling gift for the practical and organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ is prophesying 1 Cor 14:3-5, 12: In the meetings of the church the highest function is to prophesy 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24-25, 31, 39: Prophesying is speaking the Lord with the Lord s word under His inspiration.
[10]  Prophesying is to speak to men building up for the church this concerns the Body of Christ , encouragement for the believers this concerns our goal, which is the building up of the Body of Christ , and consolation for the saints welfare this concerns our personal welfare related to our goal 1 Cor 14:3.
[11]  OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42, 46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23a; Matt 18:20; Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16; Heb10:24-25; 1 Thes 5:20; 1 Cor 14:26, 31, 3-5, 6, 12, 24-25, 29-30, 37, 39.
[12]  The God-invented, God-ordained, and God-created way for the church to meet Acts 2:46; 1 Cor 14:23a: Every church meeting should have the full mutuality Matt 18:20; Acts 2:42, 46; 1 Cor 14:23a, 26; Eph 4:16: In each attendant having a portion of the riches of Christ to share with others for the organic building up of the Body of Christ ...whenever you come together, each one has...
[13]  OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:4b; 2 Tim 3:16-17; Ezek.
[14]  3:4; Lam 3:22-23; Prov 4:18; Psa 119:147-148; Jer 15:16; Matt 4:4; 1 Cor 14:32; 1 John 1:6-7; Rom 8:4; Acts 3:22; Eph 1:17; S. S. 1:15; 7:4; 1 Cor 2:11-12; Ezek.
[15]  We must have a vision concerning God s interest and economy, concerning the church as the Body of Christ, concerning the local churches, concerning the world, concerning the individual saints, and even concerning ourselves the view through the enlightening of the divine light.
[16]  Learning and being perfected to organically prophesy to speak the Lord into others with the constituting elements of prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ 1 Cor 14:4b: By redeeming our time and spending our energy to be saturated and soaked with the holy Word to be equipped to prophesy 2 Tim 3:16-17; Ezek.
[17]  With a clear view: Of Mary being blessed among women v. 42 , being the mother of her Lord v. 43 , and being blessed because of believing v. 45 . Of the Man-Savior: 1 In His humanity as the fruit of Mary s womb Isa 4:2 . 2 In His deity as her Lord v. 43: Psa 110:1 . Mary s speaking in Luke 1:46-55 with the constituting elements of prophesying: Speaking with the riches of the Scriptures to praise God her Savior for the blessed fruit of her womb Luke 1:42-43 as Hannah did for the fruit of her womb that would turn the age 1 Sam 2:1-10: Her soul magnifying the Lord Psa 34:2-3; 69:30.
[18]  OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:31, 24-25, 14-16, 32, 23a, 26, 19, 1, 39, 12, 33; 1 Pet 4:11; John 21:15; 2 Cor 5:14-15; 4:16; 1 John 1:7, 9; Rev 2:7; 1 Thes 5:17; 1 John 1:2-3, 6; Gal 5:16; Phil 1:19-21; Eph 5:18; Acts 4:31; 1 Tim 2:4; Col 3:16; Phil 3:8-10; Col 1:28-29; 1 Cor 14:26 Prophesying is divine speaking, God s oracle: One who prophesies or one who is a prophet 1 Cor 14:31, 29-30, 37 is one who receives revelations of the mysteries concerning Christ and the church Eph 3:5 and then speaks for God, speaks forth God, and even speaks God, dispenses God, into others, having God s oracle 1 Pet 4:11 .
[19]  Without the divine element, our speaking is not prophesying; instead it is only empty talk without God s speaking, without reality, and without any divine revelation or ministry of Christ.
[20]  OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:23a, 26, 31-32 The practice of prophesying: Preparation for our speaking in the church meetings is needed to prophesy properly and adequately: From our revelation gained from the Word of God and our experience of the Triune God during the week, compose a prophecy of no more than three minutes to speak when the church comes together: By enjoying the Lord through contacting Him in a portion of the Word every morning: 1 Choose a portion of the Word consisting of ten or fewer verses, covering one chapter of a book a week.
[21]  OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST A concluding charge concerning our prophesying according to God s standard for the building up of the church: The six days of the week spent with the Lord in His Word each morning to richly enjoy Christ and to receive His enlightenment gives us the basic content for our prophesying: Compile the top points at the end of the week from your daily enjoyment, enlightenment, and inspiration.
[22]  Our prophesying should not be merely something we have prepared and are speaking to the saints out of our memory; we must follow the feeling we had in fellowship with the Lord and the instant leading of the Spirit as we speak: What we speak may not be altogether according to what we have prepared beforehand; rather, as we are speaking a further seeing with new utterance comes, causing our speaking to be fresh and powerful: 1 Watchman Nee said that we cannot be a good speaker if we do not have the instant utterance.
[23]  We must have a heavenly view, a broadened view, a clear view that knows Christ and knows the church, not having our own opinions and viewpoints but rather God s viewpoint concerning His interest on the earth, His Body, the church, the local churches, the individual saints, ourselves, the world situation, the sinners condition, and God s economy; this heavenly view is gained through God s light, His Word, and the experience of Christ as life and the Spirit.
