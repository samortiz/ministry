<p>In the scene around the throne in the heavens there are also four living creatures, having the appearance of a lion, a calf, a man, and an eagle (4:6-8). These four living creatures resemble the cherubim in Ezekiel 1:5-10 and 10:14-15. The cherubim in Ezekiel 1, however, have four wings, while the living creatures in Revelation 4 and 5 have six wings (4:8), like the seraphim in Isaiah 6:2. The living creatures, therefore, must be a combination of the cherubim and the seraphim. As the seraphim, they are for God&rsquo;s holiness (Isa. 6:3), and as the cherubim, they are for God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 10:18-19; Heb. 9:5).</p>
<p>Moreover, Colossians 1:20 indicates that in addition to man, all other creatures except the angels need God&rsquo;s redemption. Therefore, the four living creatures represent not man only but the entire redeemed creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVEN LAMPS OF FIRE</h2>
<p>Revelation 4:5 speaks of the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. Authorities on Greek tell us that the word for<em>lamp</em> here denotes a torch. Common lamps are good for indoor use, but when we move, walk, and do things outdoors, we need a torch. This corresponds with the view of the book of Revelation, which speaks of God going outside His house to judge the world. These seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. This does not mean, however, that God has seven Spirits. God&rsquo;s Spirit is one, but in the intensified function and work of God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s Spirit is sevenfold. Therefore, He is the seven Spirits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SEA OF GLASS MINGLED WITH FIRE</h2>
<p>The seventh item presented here is a glassy sea like crystal before the throne (4:6). In Revelation 15:2 this sea of glass is mingled with fire. The better students of the Scriptures tell us that this glassy sea will eventually become the lake of fire. Originally it is a sea, but eventually it becomes a lake. In front of the tabernacle there was the laver for washing (Exo. 30:17-21), and in front of the temple stood a bronze sea with ten bronze lavers (1 Kings 7:23, 38). The people of Israel crossed the Red Sea and the Jordan River, and we Christians are baptized in water to deal with all the negative things. In the entire universe there is a sea to deal with every negative matter. Eventually, this sea will become the lake of fire.</p>
<p>If we combine all these seven items, we have a full picture of the scene in the heavens. In the universe there is a throne, and the One who sits on the throne is the very God of life and redemption. He will judge the earth, but He will never forget His covenant with man concerning the earth. Before Him and around Him there are the elders of the universe, representing the angels, and the four living creatures, representing the redeemed creation. Coming out from the throne are the seven &ldquo;torches,&rdquo; the seven lamps of fire, the sevenfold Spirit in God&rsquo;s operation and judgment. Then whatever God judges becomes the &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; of the universe which is swept into the glassy sea.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST QUALIFIED TO OPEN THE SCROLL<br />
AND ITS SEVEN SEALS</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:1 says that on the right hand of the One who sits upon the throne there is a scroll sealed up with seven seals. This scroll is a book of mystery. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?&rdquo; There was a challenge, but there was no answer: &ldquo;And no one in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it. And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). While John was weeping, the glad tidings came that there is One in the universe who is worthy, who is the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Root of David. He has overcome so He may open the scroll and its seven seals. After hearing this, John turned and saw not a Lion but a Lamb. To the enemy Christ is the Lion, but to the redeemed ones He is the Lamb. This Lion-Lamb is the unique One who is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals (vv. 5-6).</p>
<p>The scroll is the new covenant enacted by the Lord Jesus with His own blood for the whole universe. Without this scroll, this covenant, the universe could not exist. Moreover, the scroll is sealed with seven seals. All the mysteries, all the things which happen in the created universe, are recorded in this scroll.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus took the scroll and was about to open its seals, two hosts in the universe worshipped and praised Him. The first host is the angels represented by the twenty-four elders who take the lead to worship Him. The rest of the creation is represented by the four living creatures who also take the lead to worship (vv. 7-8). The praise from the twenty-four elders contains seven items: power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing, while the praise from the four living creatures includes blessing, honor, glory, and might (vv. 12-13). This scene in the heavens reveals the One who is worthy to open the scroll and its seals, who is the overcoming Lion and the redeeming Lamb.</p>
<p>Some expositors say that from chapter four, Revelation begins to speak of things in the future, but this is not accurate. Chapters four and five portray the scene in heaven immediately after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension. When the Lord accomplished redemption and ascended to the heavens, He became the One who was worthy to open the secrets, the mystery, of God&rsquo;s economy in the seven seals.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
