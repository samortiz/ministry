[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE GOSPEL AND THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 4:17; Matt 24:14; John 3:3, 5; Rev 5:9-10; Rom 14:17
[2]  In this booklet we will consider the relationship between the kingdom of God and the church, but let us first ask a question which is vitally related to our subject: What is the object of the gospel?
[3]  The word "kingdom" used in the New Testament is a strong term in the Greek.
[4]  The kingdom of God is the reign of God; the kingdom of heaven is the reign of heaven.
[5]  CHAPTER TWO LIFE AND THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 5:20; Matt 5:48; Matt 7:21; Matt 19:23-26; John 3:3; Rev 22:1-2
[6]  Genesis 1 tells us that God wanted man to exercise dominion over the earth on His behalf, and it tells us also what sort of man this man must be who is to wield authority for God.
[7]  The man who is to rule the earth for God must be a man after God's "likeness" that is, like God so that when you have seen this man who is in dominion, you have, as it were, seen God Himself.
[8]  God has put His life in us for the specific purpose of meeting the demands of His kingdom, and unless we allow Him to establish His kingdom in us, His life within us cannot function.
[9]  The church was a mystery that had been hidden throughout all the generations of the past, and it was not until the Lord Jesus had brought His disciples to the point of recognizing Him as "the Christ, the Son of the living God," that He spoke openly of the church.
[10]  We might express it in three phrases the kingdom produces the church, the church brings in the kingdom, and the ultimate issue is the kingdom and the church.
[11]  In the New Jerusalem, where you can detect the nature of the church and the conditions of the kingdom, God is able to express His sovereignty fully and can therefore execute His will and display His glory.
[12]  With that summary in mind let us now inquire: Why was the church needed?
[13]  God has a purpose concerning the universe, but for its accomplishment it was necessary for Him to wield authority, because as we pointed out earlier, no plan can be carried into effect where authority is lacking.
[14]  He has undertaken many other tasks, but the work that is central to all His other work, and the work that is the ultimate to which all His other work is directed, is the structure of which the Lord speaks in Matthew 16 "I will build my church."
[15]  If we know our Bibles, and if we know something of fellowship with God, then we will know that the church was a secret long hidden in the heart of God.
[16]  But let us bring our consideration of this so lofty theme right down to everyday life and consider it in its practical aspect.
[17]  What is the usual concept of building the church?
[18]  You open a place of worship, you introduce people to Christianity, you have them baptized, you arrange a variety of meetings, you get things organized a bit and you have the church!
[19]  I do not wish to enlarge on this line, but I long that the Lord's children might realize that what we have just described is not what the Bible means by building the church.
[20]  Before men are saved they are under the authority of Satan, and after they are saved they are delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love Col 1:13 .
[21]  Salvation is not merely a matter of God in His compassion for men translating them from hell to heaven, but of delivering them "out of the authority of darkness" and transferring them "into the kingdom of the Son of His love."
[22]  We think if we are just keen enough, we can gather some people together, and you can set up a church on this street, and I can set up a church on that street, and we can hire a preacher to preach for us.
