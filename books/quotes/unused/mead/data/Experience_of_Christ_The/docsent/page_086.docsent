   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD BEING STRAITENED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Luke 12:50 the Lord Jesus said, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Very few Christians understand this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus came out to minister, He was baptized by John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in this verse He said that He still had a baptism to undergo and that He was straitened until it was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word "straitened" in this verse means compressed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While the Lord Jesus was in His humanity, He was compressed; He was in a strait, in a narrow place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that He was restricted and that there was no release for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Within Him was something unlimited, immeasurable, and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The divine life in Him was compressed, straitened, constrained, and confined.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, it was limited.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This limitation could be removed only by the baptism of dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the unlimited divine eternal life within the Lord Jesus could be released.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1933 Brother Nee gave me a book entitled The Release of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This book covered John 12:24 and Luke 12:50.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I cannot express the great help I received through the reading of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The day I read that book I saw that the death of Christ was not only for redemption, but also for the release and the impartation of the divine life that was within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only did His death release the life of God from within Him; it also imparted it into us, making us grains of wheat just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus said that if a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it will produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Certainly the many grains are the same as the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we, the grains produced out of Christ's death, are the same as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah, He was the one grain, and we are the many grains!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One difference between the one grain and the many is that He was willing to fall into the ground, but we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead of falling into the ground to die, we like to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if we are lifted up, there will be no multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only way for a grain to multiply is to fall into the ground and die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, it will remain alone, perhaps alone in a high place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All genuine Christians are grains, but not many are willing to fall into the ground and die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some years ago there were thousands of "Jesus people," but where are they now?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There was a huge crowd, but there was very little life because few experienced the death of Christ.</S>
