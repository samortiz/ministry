<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SALVATION OF<br>THE ADULTEROUS WOMAN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 40</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 4:1-15, 29</H1><P>The Scriptures we have read today record something very marvelous. The Lord preached to a most immoral woman, and this woman eventually turned to Him.</P><P>John 4:3-7 says, "He left Judea and went away again into Galilee. And He had to pass through Samaria. So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar...and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour. There came a woman of Samaria to draw water." Please note that about the sixth hour the woman came to draw water. When is the sixth hour? We all know it is twelve o'clock. The Lord Jesus was wearied from His journey and rested at the well. It was at that moment that a woman came to draw water.</P><P>By reading the Old Testament, we know that every time women came to draw water they always came as a group. They either came in the morning or in the late afternoon. However, in this instance it was high noon, and the weather was very hot. This woman came to draw water by herself. Did she not have any companions? Did she not have neighbors? Were there no other women that would come with her to draw water? Indeed, she had no companion or friend. Why? The latter section of this chapter tells of her history. She was a very immoral woman.</P><P>When she came to draw water, it was high noon. It was the hottest time. This woman was a lonely woman! No one would be her companion, and no one sympathized with her. In the hearts of many women, she was a sinner, a filthy woman; they could not go with her to draw water. Not only were people afraid of her, but she also was afraid of people. If she came in the morning to draw water, she was afraid someone would point to her and say, "This is a very immoral woman." If she came in the evening to draw water, she was also afraid that people would point to her and say, "This is a very defiled woman." Therefore, she had to come at high noon to draw water by herself. She was a lonely woman, despised by the world. At the same time, she also despised the world. She was a lonely woman, and no one sympathized with her. But when she came to the well to draw water this time, she met another lonely person. She was lonely and despised by people. He also was lonely and despised by people. Her loneliness was caused by her sin; His loneliness was caused by man's jealousy; He could only go back to Galilee. Oh, when the lonely sinner met the lonely Savior, she was saved.</P><P>"Jesus said to her, Give Me something to drink" (v. 7). This was an invitation for her to draw near. Many times you are afraid of God, but you are not afraid of a person who asks you for water. There are many times when you are afraid of God, but you are not afraid of God asking you for water. Many times you fear God and think that He is high and fearful. But if you know that the One who is as lonely, wearied, and sweating as you are is the very God Himself, you will believe. The Lord is here. The Lord has the affection of a friend and is very approachable.</P><P>The Samaritan woman said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?...Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" (vv. 9-10).</P><P>The Samaritan woman said this because there was no contact between the Jews and the Samaritans. The Lord answered by saying that if she knew two things, (1) the gift of God, and (2) who it was who was saying to her, "Give Me a drink," she would have asked of Him, and He would have given her living water. It is a pity that there are many people in the world who do not know these two things. Today even some among us may also not know these two things. Some sitting here may be bored, weary, or disappointed because of the burden of sin or dissatisfaction in life. The worldly road is indeed a very rugged road, and the sea of sin is indeed stormy. But if you know these two things, all will be well.</P>
