<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</H1><P>Verse 1:"And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples." "Drew near to Jerusalem." This is the place where God's prophets were killed. Bethphage means "the household of the unripe figs." Jerusalem was originally the place of the kings. However, when the Lord came, He was rejected. This was because the figs were still unripe.</P><P>Verse 2:"Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie them and lead them to Me." In the other Gospels only a colt was mentioned. In the Gospel of Matthew there are a donkey and a colt because this has typological significance. A colt was unclean. Only after it was ridden did it become clean.</P><P>Verse 3:"And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and immediately he will send them." "The Lord has need of them." Here "the Lord" is Jehovah. Therefore, the Lord Jesus made use of them in the capacity of the Creator. All things belong to the Creator. Bible expositors all say that the donkey signifies the Gentiles and the colt signifies the Israelites. Actually, the colt signifies the Gentiles and the donkey signifies the Israelites. The Lord gained the power through the Gentiles, but the Jews followed. It is most difficult to ride on a colt; even a donkey expert cannot do it. Every saved person was once a colt. After we were saved, the Lord rode on us as a colt. A horse signifies war; a donkey signifies peace. This time the Lord came as the Prince of Peace. When He comes the second time, He will ride on a white horse (Rev. 19:11).</P><P>Verse 4:"Now this took place in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying..." This verse fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet in Zechariah 9:9.</P><P>Verse 5:"Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden." In the prophet's prophecy there were such words as "righteous" and "salvation." In the Gospel of Matthew, the quotations from the Old Testament regarding salvation and righteousness refer to the kingdom. Thus, what the Lord indicated here was that although He was rejected, He was the King.</P><P>Verses 6-8:"And the disciples went and did as Jesus directed them, and led the donkey and the colt. And they put their garments on them, and He sat upon them. And most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road." The healing of the blind previously was the prelude because in that incident the Lord was called "the Son of David." Here, the people also called Him "the Son of David." Many Bible scholars say that this was the Lord's last offering of Himself to the Jews. But this cannot be right, because the Jews had already been rejected in chapter thirteen. Otherwise, why did the Lord dwell in Bethany? It was because Jerusalem had already become a forsaken place.</P><P>Verse 9:"And the crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!" "Hosanna" is a cry for help. (It indirectly means to praise.) It means that this One has the power and is worthy of our praise.</P><P>Verses 10-11:"And when He entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this? And the crowds said, This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee." It was a pity that on the way they addressed Him as "the Son of David," and yet here they identified Him as "the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee." Not too long after that they crucified Him on the cross. "All the city was stirred." This is parallel to the situation in chapter two. The situation on the way was good, but once He entered the city, things became different.</P><P>Verses 12-13:"And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those who were selling and buying in the temple. And He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling the doves, and He said to them, It is written, `My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers." This was the Lord's purifying of the temple the second time. At the beginning of His ministry, He purified it the first time (John 2:13-17). Here it was the conclusion of His ministry, and there was the need for another purification. The first time it was "My Father's house," and He was purifying it in His qualification as the Son of God. Here it was "My house," and He was purifying it in His qualification as the Son of David and as the King. For the Lord to become a king, He must have the pure worship. "Money changers...selling the doves." To exchange money and to sell sacrificial animals surely provided convenience for those worshipping God. However, the Lord viewed these things as being unclean. In the matter of worship, the Lord has no need of an intermediary or a go-between. These things advertise themselves as providing convenience for men; actually they are there merely for monetary gain. Apparently it was for the convenience of the temple, but in reality it was in the nature of merchandizing. "A den of robbers." This does not refer to stealing. To open a shop on a big street is to do business. To open a store on a straight street also is to do business. But to open a stand in the temple is robbery. To be a teacher in a school is to do business; but to be a pastor in a church is to be a robber. A robber steals while people are not paying attention. The robbers in the church also work while people are not paying attention, the only difference is that people are thankful for their work. The Lord shows us that the temple must be pure.</P><P>Verse 14:"And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them." First He purified, which is to maintain the moral standard; then He healed, which is the outflow of grace. Here the sick ones are not sick with leprosy, but are sick with blindness and lameness. The Lord healed the eyesight and the strength. This means to make people understand His purpose and do His will.</P>
