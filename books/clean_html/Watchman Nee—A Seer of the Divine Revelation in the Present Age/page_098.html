<P>This is the second letter written by Watchman to the same nephew-in-law. It was dated May 26, 1972, only four days before his death.</P><P>"While in Feng-Shu-Ling I wrote you a letter" indicates that the earlier letter was written in Feng-Shu-Ling.</P><P>"Address it to Group No. 14, Pai-Yun-Shan Farm, Kwang-Te County, Anhwei province" indicates that Watchman died in the Pai-Yun-Shan Farm, Kwang-Te County, Anhwei province. Pai-Yun-Shan Farm is probably the same as Shan-Shia-Pu mentioned in letter six.</P><P>"I hope very much to go back to my relatives" indicates how he desired to be released and go to his relatives. But he died four days later.</P><P>In all of the above letters, there is no mention of the name of the Lord or of God. This indicates that he did not have the freedom to do so.</P><P style="text-align:center">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Letter Eight</H2><P>May 30, 1972<br>Eldest Sister Pin-cheng,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>I have been reassigned to Shan-Shia-Pu Group No. 14. It is ten [Chinese] miles away from the station and is separated from it by a mountain. It is very inconvenient for you to come.

I can only wish you well.</P><P>Shu-tsu</P><P style="text-align:center">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>This was the last letter of Watchman Nee. It shows that the farm in which he died was quite remote, being ten Chinese miles from the station and separated from the station by a mountain. The fact that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted his sister-in-law to visit him and the fact that he had left the care of his wife's ashes to his sister-in-law, seem to indicate that he had sensed his imminent death. He died the same day.</P>
