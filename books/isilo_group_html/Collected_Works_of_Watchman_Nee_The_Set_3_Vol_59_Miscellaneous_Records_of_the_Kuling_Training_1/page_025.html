We have to show the brothers and sisters, according to the New Testament, first that mammon is an idol, and second that we have been delivered from mammon. Deliverance from mammon is part of our salvation. It is like deliverance from sin, the world, and the flesh. Many people know that in order to be saved, a man must be delivered from sin, from God's punishment, and from the world's bondage, but many people do not know that salvation includes deliverance from mammon. In Luke 18 and 19, three things&mdash;eternal life, the kingdom of the heavens, and salvation&mdash;are linked together. All three things relate to mammon. First, the young ruler wanted to inherit eternal life. The Lord told him to sell all that he had and to follow Him. Second, the Lord spoke on the difficulty of a rich man's entry into God's kingdom. It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter God's kingdom! He went on to say that those who give up houses, wives, or children for the kingdom's sake would receive a hundredfold in this age and eternal life in the age to come. An entry into God's kingdom requires the forsaking of one's all. Peter was saved because he forsook his all. Those who are able to avoid the fate of a camel which has difficulty passing through a needle's eye are the ones who have forsaken their all to enter the kingdom of the heavens. Third, Zaccheus gave half of his possessions to the poor, and the Lord said that salvation had come to his house. Therefore, in order for a man to receive eternal life, the kingdom, and salvation, he has to be delivered from mammon and to dispose of everything.</p><p>Today we are not doing a fund-raising work. We are here to help others to receive eternal life, to enter the kingdom, and to be saved. If we ask many people if they want the kingdom, they will say yes. If we ask them if they want eternal life, they will also say yes. If we ask them if they want to be saved, they will say yes all the more. If, however, we ask if they want to be delivered from mammon, they will say no. A brother from a denomination came to our meetings, and said to my brother Hwai-zhu, "You are very good at fund-raising here at Hardoon Road." My brother asked why he was so interested in the saints' consecration. He answered, "I want to learn and observe a few more times. If your method works well, we will do the same in our denomination." This man only saw how money was offered. He did not see how we teach men to be delivered from mammon.</p><p>When Peter heard the Lord's word concerning a camel going through a needle's eye being easier than a rich man entering God's kingdom, he asked, "Then who can be saved?" He forgot that he himself was a camel, and that this camel, in fact, had passed through the needle's eye already. He forgot that there were eleven other camels who had done the same. While there is nothing harder than a rich man being saved, what is impossible with man is possible with God. The rich young ruler turned back. He was not a sinner or an evil man. He was charming and godly, yet he was not saved. Zaccheus was also a rich man. He was a slave of mammon, yet he was saved. He climbed up and down the tree. His going up and coming down undid him; it made him poor; nevertheless, he was saved. The young ruler is an example of what is "impossible with men," and Zaccheus is an example of what is "possible with God." A man experiences joy when his sins are forgiven. He experiences the same joy when he is delivered from mammon. When a man believes in the Lord, he finds peace in his heart. When mammon no longer occupies any place in him, he also finds peace in his heart. The receiving of eternal life is something that God accomplishes. Deliverance from mammon is also something that God accomplishes. Forgiveness of sins, the receiving of eternal life, and deliverance from mammon are all God's accomplishments. Peter asked, "Then who can be saved?" The Lord could have answered him, saying, "Zaccheus!" When God works in us, we will no longer remain a camel; we will be saved from mammon. Our salvation includes salvation from mammon. We should never leave out this item in our consideration of the sphere our salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
