These gifted persons perfect the saints to be what they are. This is similar to the professors in a teachers&#8217; college who perfect their students to become teachers like they are. A local church may be likened to a teachers&#8217; college, and the gifted persons are like professors teaching different courses. They perfect the saints to be what they are-apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. The gifts&#8217; perfecting of the saints results in a proper local church.]<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_084.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_086.html">Next</a> </body></html>
