[1]  Lesson 21: Enoch s Prophecy and Noah s Prophecies concerning Shem, Ham, and Japheth
[2]  AND NOAH S PROPHECIES concerning SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH OUTLINE Enoch s prophecy: Enoch prophesying concerning God using the flood to judge the ungodly generation of that time.
[3]  Enoch prophesying concerning the manifestation of Christ in His return.
[4]  Noah s prophecies concerning Shem, Ham, and Japheth: After the flood Noah being the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind and also being God s deputy authority: Noah failing because of looseness and carelessness.
[5]  After failing, Noah prophesying according to God s government: Noah s prophecy concerning Ham: Canaan, a descendant of Ham, being cursed to be a servant to Shem and Japheth.
[6]  Ham s descendants producing the nations that oppose God s people.
[7]  I. ENOCH S PROPHECY A. Enoch Prophesying concerning God
[8]  This name is an important prophecy concerning the coming of God s judging flood on that ungodly generation at the time of Methuselah s death.
[9]  However, since God had established him as the leader, Noah had to speak, not according to his feeling of conviction but according to God s government.
[10]  Noah s Prophecy concerning Japheth a. Japheth Being Enlarged
[11]  God gave Japheth the blessing of being enlarged Gen 9:27 .
[12]  The promise to Abraham: His being made into a great nation, his name being made great, and his being made the father of a great nation.
[13]  Hence, Abraham was a definite beginning for God s people, and the nation of Israel was also a definite beginning for God s people.
[14]  God promised to bless Abraham v. 2 . This blessing consists of the blessings of God s creation and redemption, including all that God wants to give man God Himself and all that He has in this age and in the age to come.
[15]  According to Galatians 3:14 this blessing is the promise of the Spirit: That the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[16]  God not only promised that He would be a blessing to Abraham but that Abraham would be a blessing to all the families, all the nations, of the earth Gen 12:3 .
[17]  In Genesis 15:12-16 God prophesied that Abraham s promised seed would suffer affliction.
[18]  In that darkness God prophesied concerning Abraham s seed, saying, Know assuredly that your seed will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and they will serve them; and they will afflict them four hundred years.
[19]  History proves that Abraham s seed did suffer affliction for a period of four hundred years beginning with Ishmael s persecution of Isaac in about 1891 B.C. 21:9; Gal 4:29 until the exodus out of Egypt in about 1491 B.C. Exo 3:7-8; Acts 7:6 . Ishmael s mocking of Isaac was the beginning of the affliction of Abraham s seed that was to continue for four hundred years.
[20]  THE PROMISE TO JACOB A. Being Fruitful and Multiplying
[21]  In Genesis 35:11a God said to Jacob, I am the All-sufficient God: / Be fruitful and multiply.
[22]  God made another promise to Jacob, saying, A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, / And kings shall come forth from your loins v. 11b . This verse first speaks of a company of nations, indicating multiplication, and then kings, indicating the kingdom.
[23]  Furthermore, Revelation 11:15 speaks of the fulfillment of God s promise made to Jacob: The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.
[24]  for His Twelve Sons 1 OUTLINE Jacob prophesying with blessing: Jacob s words being prophecy as well as blessing.
[25]  CONCERNING JUDAH A. Being Praised and Worshipped by His Brothers
[26]  Concerning Judah, Jacob prophesied: Judah, your brothers will praise you; / Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; / Your father s sons will bow down before you Gen 49:8 .
[27]  V. CONCERNING ZEBULUN A. Dwelling at the Shore of the Sea and
[28]  FOR HIS TWELVE SONS 2 OUTLINE Concerning Dan: Judging his people as one of the tribes scepters of Israel.
[29]  Genesis 49 contains the essence of the entire Bible, and it is a summary of the history of Jacob s twelve sons, the history of Israel, the history of the church, and the individual spiritual history of God s people.
[30]  After the Israelites entered the good land, the tribe of Dan brought in an idol and became one with God s enemy, becoming a serpent in the way, a viper on the path, and bringing in a stumbling block to God s people.
[31]  First, he was blessed with the choicest things of heaven; second, he was blessed with the dew; third, he was blessed with the blessing of the deep that lies beneath; fourth, he was blessed with the choicest of the crops of the sun; fifth, he was blessed with the choicest of the yield of the moons; sixth, he was blessed with receiving the top of the ancient mountains; seventh, he was blessed with the choicest things of the eternal hills; eighth, he was blessed with the choicest things of the earth and its fullness; ninth, he was blessed with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb, which relate to life; tenth, he was blessed with the favor of Him who dwelt in the thornbush.
[32]  THROUGH BALAAM S PARABLES OUTLINE The first parable: The children of Israel being a people who live alone and do not reckon themselves among the nations.
[33]  Who can count the dust of Jacob, / Or number the fourth part of Israel?
[34]  The second parable: God not beholding iniquity in Jacob nor seeing trouble in Israel.
[35]  B. Who Can Count the Dust of Jacob, /
[36]  In verse 10 Balaam went on to say, Who can count the dust of Jacob, / Or number the fourth part of Israel?
[37]  A. How Fair Are Your Tents, O Jacob, /
[38]  AND THE BLESSING OF MOSES 1 OUTLINE The prophecies in the covenant enacted by Moses with the new generation of the children of Israel: The land being cursed, and the children of Israel being plucked off from their land and sent to another land if they forsake the covenant of Jehovah.
[39]  Jehovah God turning the captivity of the children of Israel if they return to Him while living among the nations.
[40]  At that time, Jehovah God set the promised good land before them, and Moses told them to be bold and go up and possess the land as God had spoken to them vv.
[41]  Although the spies sent by the children of Israel brought back word that the land was an exceedingly good land, a land which flowed with milk and honey v. 25; Num 13:27 , they also brought an evil report to the people that caused the whole assembly of the children of Israel to murmur against Moses and Aaron and even to want to appoint a captain and return to Egypt 14:4 . Because of their unbelief at Kadesh-barnea, God caused them to turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea Deut 1:40 . They wandered in the wilderness for thirty-eight years until the entire generation of the unbelieving men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp 2:1-15 .
[42]  Moses was concerned that they would repeat the failure of their forefathers, and so he spoke many words to them, including a review of their past, a warning, exhortations, and charges 1:1 4:43; 27:1 28:68; 31:1-13, 24-29 , so that the new generation of the children of Israel would be encouraged to remember God s marvelous grace and mighty works and to obey His statutes and ordinances.
[43]  the Children of Israel If They Return to Him While Living among the Nations
[44]  Jehovah God would turn, and He would gather them from all the peoples among whom He had scattered them and bring them into the land which their fathers possessed.
[45]  Moses called heaven and earth to witness against the children of Israel because he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse v. 19 . He also exhorted them to choose life that they and their seed might live, in loving Jehovah their God by listening to His voice and holding fast to Him.
[46]  Verses 36 through 43 say that when Jehovah saw that the support of His people was gone, He would vindicate them and have compassion on His servants.
[47]  This indicates that no matter how evil the children of Israel might be and no matter how much God might be provoked in His anger toward them, eventually the result, the issue, would still be good.
[48]  However, God also promised through Moses that if while in captivity the children of Israel would return to Jehovah their God and listen to His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, Jehovah would be compassionate to them and gather them from all the nations.
[49]  Moses also said that Levi would show Jacob Jehovah s ordinances and Israel His law.
[50]  Zebulun Rejoicing for His Going Forth and Issachar for His Tents
[51]  In Deuteronomy 33:22 Moses prophesied, Dan is a lion s whelp / That leaps forth from Bashan.
[52]  Moses said that there is no one like the God of Jeshurun Israel , who rides through the heavens as their help and in His majesty through the skies v. 26 . He also said that the God of old would be their habitation, and underneath would be the eternal arms v. 27 . The children of Israel would dwell in God as their habitation, and His eternal arms would be underneath them.
[53]  Because of the foregoing blessings, Israel would dwell securely, the fountain of Jacob in solitude, on a land of grain and new wine, with the heavens over him dropping their dew v. 28 . Finally, Moses proclaimed, Happy are you, O Israel; who is like you? / A people saved by Jehovah, / The shield of your help / And He who is the sword of your majesty! / So your enemies shall come cringing to you, / And you shall tread upon their high places v. 29 . This was a final blessing on all the children of Israel.
[54]  Joel, on one hand, declared and prophesied the judgment of God and, on the other hand, declared that if Israel would turn to Jehovah with all her heart and have a thorough confession, God would send forth His blessings and would bless His land with rich produce, recovering the rains, the early rain and the late rain at the beginning of the season.
[55]  The ministry of Amos the prophet was during the end of the reign of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, about 787 B.C. The object of Amos s ministry was the northern kingdom of Israel.
[56]  without Prince, without Sacrifice, without Pillar, and without Ephod and Teraphim
[57]  Hosea told Gomer, the woman of adulteries, to abide with him many days without going about as a harlot or being another man s, and he would be the same toward her v. 3 . According to verse 4, this symbolizes that the children of Israel would abide for many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without pillar for worship, and without ephod and teraphim, that is, idols in homes.
[58]  Jeremiah s ministry began from the thirteenth year of Josiah s reign and continued until the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, from about 629 to 588 B.C. During the forty-one years of his ministry, the kingdom of Judah was rapidly declining.
[59]  As a result of the stirring of the hidden God, King Cyrus made a decree, charging the children of Israel who were in captivity to return to Jerusalem and build God s temple Ezra 1:1-4; 2 Chron 36:22-23 .
[60]  At the time of the apostasy and degradation of His people, God raised up many prophets who prophesied concerning Israel s being chastised by God due to their apostasy, their being taken captive to Gentile nations, and their returning to the Holy Land.
[61]  CONCERNING THE GENTILE NATIONS SURROUNDING ISRAEL OUTLINE Israel being the center of God s economy among the human race on earth.
[62]  Although the prophecies in Ezekiel are mainly concerning the house of Israel, this book also contains prophecies concerning God s judgment upon the Gentile nations surrounding Israel.
[63]  In chapters 25 through 32 Ezekiel prophesied that Jehovah would judge the seven nations surrounding Israel because they worshipped idols and ill-treated God s chosen people Israel.
[64]  THE CONDITION OF THE NATIONS A. Ammon and Moab
[65]  The Moabites signify persons who like to bring God s people into an association with the world and who like to make God s people the same as the nations.
[66]  The first result of God s judgment upon the nations was that all the nations, as well as Israel, would come to know that He is the Lord Jehovah.
[67]  When God scattered mankind, He set up the borders of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel in order to make Israel the center of the inhabited earth.
[68]  The prophecy concerning human government: The vision concerning Nebuchadnezzar s dream: The contents of Nebuchadnezzar s dream.
[69]  In Daniel 2 Nebuchadnezzar had a marvelous dream of a great human image v. 1 . That dream should have impressed him deeply, but he forgot the dream because he did not have a heart for God s interest.
[70]  The great human image will be replaced with a great mountain, which signifies the eternal kingdom of God that will fill the whole earth v. 44 . When Christ comes to crush the totality of human government, He will usher in the eternal kingdom of God on earth Rev 11:15 .
[71]  All God s people need to see the controlling vision in the second chapter of Daniel and, in the light of this vision, have a clear view regarding human government.
[72]  However, according to Daniel 2 and 7, in the eyes of God every human government is a beast.
[73]  If God s people see this controlling vision, they will be kept from the world and prepared for Christ s coming.
[74]  As for the first three beasts in Daniel 7, their dominion, that is, their authority and kingdom, was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a season and for a time v. 12 . This indicates that although the dominion and authority of Babylon, Persia, and Greece were taken away, their culture will be extended and remain.
[75]  According to His economy, God is ruling over the world in order to produce a situation for Israel to be His elect, to gain the church to be His mysterious people, and to have all the nations to be the peoples in the eternal kingdom of God.
[76]  The prophecy concerning human government in Daniel shows that the ruling of the heavens by the God of the heavens 2:37, 44 over all human government on earth matches God s eternal economy for Christ to terminate the old creation for the germination of the new creation and to smash and crush the aggregate of human government and establish the eternal kingdom of God.
[77]  THE SEVENTY WEEKS OUTLINE The purpose of the seventy weeks.
[78]  Daniel s vision was in the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, who was king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans in about 538 B.C. v. 1 . When Daniel understood by means of the Scriptures the number of the years, which came as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, that is, seventy years v. 2 , he prayed and confessed his own sins and the sins of the kings, the chief men, and the fathers of Israel, and of all the people of Israel vv.
[79]  THE CONTENTS OF THE SEVEN WEEKS A. Seven Weeks of Forty-nine Years
[80]  The first seven weeks, of forty-nine years, was the time apportioned from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the rebuilding.
[81]  THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL 1 OUTLINE God s promise to restore Israel.
[82]  Prophecies concerning the restoration of Israel in the Old Testament age: Isaiah s prophecy concerning the restoration of Israel: Jehovah causing the children of Israel to return: The remnant of Jacob returning to the mighty God.
[83]  The prophets also prophesied that the captured children of Israel would repent to God and that God would gather them together and bring them back to the good land to receive blessings from Him and to be restored.
[84]  the Children of Israel to Return a. The Remnant of Jacob Returning to the Mighty God
[85]  Verse 20 says, In that day the remnant of Israel and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped will no longer rely upon him who strikes them, but they will rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
[86]  At His return Christ will be raised up as a standard for the gathering of Jehovah s scattered people 62:10 .
[87]  He waters it every moment, and He guards it by night and by day lest anyone visit harm upon it v. 3 . Isaiah also spoke of how Israel will be blessed: In the days to come Jacob will take root; / Israel will blossom and bud; / And they will fill the surface of the world with their produce v. 6 . Verse 9 says that the iniquity of Jacob will be expiated, and the fruit of the removal of their sin is that they will make all the stones of their altars like chalk stones beaten to powder such that the Asherahs and sun images will not stand.
[88]  Jehovah will bless Israel with the blessing of new wine, and they will possess His mountain, Zion, in order to dwell, eat, drink, and rejoice there 65:8-10, 13-16 .
[89]  In the restoration there will be new wine that will cheer God and His people.
[90]  THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL 2 OUTLINE Jeremiah s prophecy concerning the restoration of Israel: Jehovah promising to restore Israel: Jehovah gathering the remnant of His flock out of the lands where He has driven them.
[91]  In His days Judah being saved, Israel dwelling securely, and Christ s name being called Jehovah our righteousness.
[92]  out of the Lands Where He Has Driven Them
[93]  Jehovah said that He would gather the remnant of His flock out of all the lands where He had driven them and would bring them back to their pasture.
[94]  He also said that they would be fruitful and would multiply v. 3 . Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when they will no longer say, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, As Jehovah lives, who brought up and led back the seed of the house of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where I had driven them, that they might dwell in their own land vv.
[95]  and the Palace Being Inhabited after Its Own Manner
[96]  Jehovah will turn the captivity of the tents of Jacob and will have compassion on his dwelling places.
[97]  The first blessing of the new covenant that Israel will receive at the time of the restoration is in the first part of verse 33: This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts.
[98]  The third blessing of the new covenant is that they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah v. 34 . This word indicates that at the time of the restoration, the people of Israel will know God to such an extent that they will not need anyone to teach them.
[99]  Jehovah will establish the good word which He has spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah v. 14 . He will cause to shoot forth a Shoot Christ of righteousness unto David, who will execute justice and righteousness in the land v. 15 . Verse 16 says, In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely; and this is the name by which she will be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
[100]  God also promised Israel that He would make a covenant with them v. 25 . This covenant is an everlasting covenant 37:26 . Since God will make a covenant with them, He will banish evil beasts from the land 34:25 ; that is, the evil persons who disturb God s people will cease.
[101]  God further promised that He will make Israel and the places around His hill a blessing, and that He will cause showers to come down in their season; there will be showers of blessing v. 26 . The trees of the field will yield their fruit, and the earth will yield its increase v. 27 . God will raise up for them a planting place of renown, and the fruit will be for the enjoyment of His people.
[102]  Jehovah made a promise to Israel, saying, I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your filthiness and from all your idols I will cleanse you.
[103]  This new heart enables them to love God and everything of God.
[104]  God will also give them a heart of flesh so that they are soft and sensitive toward God.
[105]  God also promised that He would put His Spirit within them so that His Spirit can always strengthen them in their new spirit, causing them to have the strength to love God and to fellowship with Him.
[106]  Thus, the restored people of Israel in the kingdom age will be able to walk in God s statutes and keep His ordinances.
[107]  THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL 3 OUTLINE Hosea s prophecy concerning the restoration of Israel: Becoming the sons of God.
[108]  In the restoration when the children of Judah and the children of Israel are gathered together, they will appoint for themselves one head, and they will go up from the land of their captivity; great will be the day of Jezreel, meaning God sows or God will sow, the day for the people of Israel to be sown in the Holy Land by God Hosea 1:11; cf.
[109]  Joel said that Jehovah is willing to save Israel by pouring out His Spirit as the early rain upon them vv.
[110]  The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the Spirit of God compounded with Christ s humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension.
[111]  Saviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will be Jehovah s v. 21 .
[112]  These two items were fulfilled at the time of the Maccabees, and they will be further fulfilled in glory at the time of the restoration for the kingdom of God Matt 19:28; Rev 11:15 .
[113]  The prophet Zechariah also prophesied that the nations will come to Israel to entreat the favor, the grace, of Jehovah, and the children of Israel will be priests to them vv.
[114]  They will teach the Gentiles, the nations, to know God s way and God s person, and they will teach them to worship and serve God.
[115]  The nations were formerly idol worshippers or atheists, but they will turn to God, and God will turn to them to be their God.
[116]  God will provide the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with an opened fountain, Christ s pierced side, for sin and for impurity John 19:34, 37 .
[117]  B. The Mystery Spoken by Paul in Romans 11
[118]  In Romans 11:25 Paul says, I do not want you, brothers, to be ignorant of this mystery lest you be wise in yourselves , that hardness has come upon Israel in part, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in. The fullness of the Gentiles refers to the repentant and believing Gentiles.
[119]  When the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, according to Paul s declaration in verse 26, all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
[120]  LESSON THIRTY-FIVE THE PROPHECIES OF THE SEVEN SEALS,
[121]  In Revelation 4 John saw the scene in heaven after Christ s ascension.
[122]  He saw the throne of God as the center and God sitting on the throne ready to execute His universal administration for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.
[123]  They are a record of God s thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.
[124]  Revelation 6:7-8 say, When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.
[125]  When the supernatural calamities begin, the earth s dwellers the kings of the earth, the great men, the generals, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free man will hide in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of Their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?
[126]  Actually, this will not yet be the great day of God s wrath; it will be only a foretaste and a warning to them to repent.
[127]  However, before the sixth seal transpires, God will do two things to preserve His people: He will seal the chosen remnant of Israel, and He will begin the rapture of the redeemed ones of the church.
[128]  In the midst of this solemn scene, Christ appears as another Angel v. 3 to execute God s administration over the earth in the way of ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints.
[129]  THE SEVEN TRUMPETS A. The First Trumpet the Judgment on the Earth
[130]  The first trumpeted, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast to the earth; and the third part of the earth was burned up, and the third part of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up v. 7 . When the angels begin to trumpet, everything in the universe will be turned upside down.
[131]  The fourth angel trumpeted, and the third part of the sun and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them would be darkened and the day would not appear for the third part of it, and the night likewise v. 12 . After the judgment of the earth, the sea, and the rivers, God s judgment will smite the third part of the heavenly hosts, damaging the third part of the sun, the moon, and the stars.
[132]  Verse 11 of chapter 9 says, They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon; and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
[133]  The four angels will use two hundred million horsemen to kill the third part of men v. 16 . The riders on the horses will have breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone v. 17 . The power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they harm men v. 19 . The sixth trumpet must be related to the pouring out of the sixth bowl upon the great river Euphrates to dry up its water so that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared 16:12 . Hence, these troops will move from the east to the west, passing through the Euphrates, to come to the richest region on earth the Middle East and join the war at Armageddon vv.
[134]  Without the seventh trumpet, God s economy and His move cannot be completed.
[135]  Hence, in the days of the seventh trumpet the mystery of God will be finished Rev 10:7 .
[136]  The negative aspect includes 1 the last plagues of the seven bowls, in which the wrath of God is finished 15:1; 16:1-21 , as the last woe to those who dwell on the earth 8:13; 9:12; 11:14 ; and 2 the destruction of the destroyers of the earth immediately upon the Lord s coming back to the earth 17:14; 18:1-2; 19:19 20:3 .
[137]  11-12 ; and 3 the giving of the reward, at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 , to the prophets and the saints after the resurrection and rapture of the saints 1 Cor 15:23, 52; 1 Thes 4:16-17 and the giving of the reward, at the throne of Christ s glory Matt 25:31-34 , to those who fear God s name Rev 14:6-7 .
[138]  The fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire.
[139]  And men were burned with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory vv.
[140]  The men who are burned with great heat, who blaspheme the name of God, and who refuse to repent must be mainly the citizens of the Roman Empire who follow Antichrist to persecute God s people and to rebel against God.
[141]  The fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores; and they did not repent of their works vv.
[142]  Immediately after this word is spoken, there will be lightnings, voices, thunders, and the greatest earthquake that the world has ever seen v. 18 . This earthquake, the same as the one mentioned in verse 19 of chapter 11, will cause the great city, Jerusalem, to be divided into three parts and the cities of the nations to fall 16:19 . Jerusalem will have become as evil as ancient Sodom; hence, God will judge it by means of this earthquake.
[143]  ISRAEL IN THE LAST WEEK 1 OUTLINE Antichrist making a firm covenant with many people.
[144]  The beast out of the sea and his persecution: Being like a leopard, his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like that of a lion.
[145]  John said, The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion v. 2 . The leopard symbolizes the swift and cruel movement of Alexander the Great, the king of Greece; the feet of the bear symbolize the stamping and destroying feet of the monarchy of Medo-Persia; and the mouth of the lion symbolizes the devouring mouth of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.
[146]  This beast will act for forty-two months 13:5 .
[147]  These forty-two months are the three and a half years in verse 14 of chapter 12 and the thousand two hundred and sixty days in verse 3 of chapter 11 and verse 6 of chapter 12, which will be the time of the great tribulation.
[148]  The beast will make war with the saints and overcome them v. 7 . The saints in verse 7 refer to the rest of the woman s seed in verse 17 of chapter 12, which consists of the Jews, who keep God s commandments, and the believers in Christ, who bear the testimony of Jesus on earth at that time.
[149]  G. Antichrist Being the Little Horn in Daniel 8
[150]  Antichrist will not only be the fourth beast in Daniel 7 but also the little horn revealed in Daniel 8:8-12 and 21-25.
[151]  This little horn denotes Antiochus Epiphanes, the king of Syria, who invaded Jerusalem and plundered the temple between 171 and 165 B.C. Antiochus Epiphanes typifies the coming Antichrist.
[152]  The apostle Paul prophesied in 2 Thessalonians 2 that Antichrist will be the man of lawlessness..., who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God...so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth, saying that he is God vv.
[153]  His coming is according to Satan s operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie and in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing vv.
[154]  ISRAEL IN THE LAST WEEK 2 OUTLINE The great red dragon and his persecution: Being cast down from heaven to the earth.
[155]  The dragon, the serpent, will cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current v. 15 . In this verse water signifies the armies that will be sent by Satan to destroy the people of God Isa 8:7-8; 17:12-13; Jer 46:7-9; 47:2-3 . Satan will stir up the kings of the earth to gather their armies to persecute the people of God.
[156]  These unclean spirits will go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty v. 14 . These three spirits will instigate the rebellious kings to send their armies to persecute God s people, which will include the Jews and the believers.
[157]  To the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place v. 14 . The great eagle signifies God, and the two wings signify His strength to rescue Exo 19:4; Deut 32:11-12 . Just as God brought the children of Israel out from Pharaoh s persecution, He will bring His people away from Satan s persecution in the great tribulation.
[158]  E. The Earth Opening Its Mouth and Swallowing the River Cast out of the Dragon s Mouth
[159]  Even though the dragon will cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman Rev 12:15 , verse 16 says, The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
[160]  The earth will open and swallow the armies sent by Satan.
[161]  After the rapture of the man-child, the woman will be left on earth to suffer persecution v. 13 . However, God will prepare a place to nourish her for a time and times and half a time, or a thousand two hundred and sixty days, the three and a half years of the great tribulation, after which, God will bring His people into the millennial kingdom.
[162]  In that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven v. 13 . The city refers to Jerusalem v. 8 . The tenth part of the city of Jerusalem will fall as a result of this earthquake, and the rest of the city of Jerusalem will be divided into three parts at the last earthquake spoken of in 16:19.
[163]  The feet of Christ will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley, so that half of the mountain will remove to the north and half of it to the south v. 4 . The remnant of the besieged Israel will flee into the valley of Jehovah s mountains by the way opened to them by Jehovah v. 5 . In order to save His chosen elect and to judge evil mankind, God will also cause that day to have no light; the shining of the sun, the moon, and the stars will withdraw v. 6 . The people of Israel will see and look upon Christ whom they pierced, they will see Him coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and all the people and tribes will repent and mourn Matt 24:30; Zech 12:10-14; Rev 1:7 . They will also believe and receive Him.
[164]  AND THE FALSE PROPHET OUTLINE Satan s fall and God pronouncing His judgment over Satan.
[165]  The executing of God s judgment over Satan: In the church age: The Lord Jesus being manifested in the flesh to destroy the works of the devil.
[166]  Hence, God s children should have a strong enmity toward Satan, the devil, and should be clear concerning the destiny of Satan ordained by God so that, through their oneness with Christ, they might withstand all the works of the devil.
[167]  However, his heart was lifted up v. 17 . He wanted to exalt himself to be equal with God and to overthrow God s authority and throne Isa 14:13-14 . Thus, he rebelled against God.
[168]  When the Lord was ministering on the earth, He appointed seventy disciples and sent them out two by two into every city and place to spread His ministry.
[169]  In Revelation 12 John saw a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems v. 3 . This great red dragon is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth v. 9 . Before the great tribulation of three and a half years, the man-child, who is composed of the overcomers among God s people throughout the ages, will be resurrected and caught up to heaven v. 5 . Because of the rapture of the man-child, Michael and his angels will begin to war against Satan in heaven.
[170]  The beast and the kings of the earth and their armies will gather together at Armageddon to make war with Him who sits on the white horse and with His army v. 19 . In this war Antichrist and his armies will be defeated, and the beast will be seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence did the signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image.
[171]  In the millennium the overcoming believers and the remnant of Israel will be God s faithful people on earth, standing with God and for God.
[172]  In the end the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever v. 10 . The lake of fire was prepared for the devil and his angels Matt 25:41 . However, the beast and the false prophet, as well as the goats in Matthew 25:32-33 and 41, will be cast into it a thousand years earlier than the devil Rev 19:20 . After the millennium of a thousand years, the devil also will be thrown into it.
[173]  THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM OUTLINE Being the last age in God s old creation.
[174]  Being the realm for Christ and the overcomers to reign over the nations and for the overcomers to be priests of God and of Christ for one thousand years.
[175]  Luke 19:12 and the first part of verse 15 indicate that the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom received by Christ from God the Father.
[176]  It comprises the kingdom of Messiah 2 Sam 7:13 , which is the expectation of many devoted Israelites from the Old Testament to the time when Christ will come back to restore the nation of Israel, and the kingdom of Christ Eph 5:5 , which is the expectation of the seeking believers in the New Testament age.
[177]  Hence, the millennial kingdom will fulfill the desire of God, the desire of the devoted Israelites, and the desire of the seeking believers in the coming age of one thousand years.
[178]  In Revelation 3:12 the Lord says, He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[179]  The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the restored kingdom of Israel the kingdom of David Acts 1:6; Mark 11:10 .
[180]  In the Old Testament the Lord promised the Jewish people that the Messiah, the anointed One, would come to inherit the throne of David and restore the Jewish nation, that is, the nation of Israel Gen 49:10; 2 Sam 7:13, 16; Psa 2:8-9; 72:1-20; 89:4; 110:2-3; Isa 9:6-7; 11:1-5, 10; Jer 23:5-6; 30:9; 33:14-17; Ezek.
[181]  Then the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem will come in. The restored and purified nations will be around the New Jerusalem as the people, and the New Jerusalem will be the eternal kingdom of God for God s manifestation and for the eternal enjoyment and experience of God s people.
[182]  25-26 , and delivers up the kingdom to God the Father, that is, when all the negative things are done away with and the entire purpose of God is fulfilled, the old creation will come to its end. At the end of the millennium, the Lord will deliver up the kingdom to God.
[183]  THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH OUTLINE The first heaven and the first earth being renewed through the judgment of God by the purging of burning fire at the close of the old creation to be the new heaven and the new earth.
[184]  Being the new universe as the realm of God s ruling in eternity.
[185]  Being the issue of God s work of the new creation within the old creation and of God s work of restoration in the old creation: God s work of the new creation in the old creation producing the regenerated, transformed, and perfected saints to be the kings and priests in the center, the New Jerusalem, of the new heaven and the new earth.
[186]  Hence, it will be the realm for God to administrate His government for eternity.
[187]  This divine administration is considered the eternal kingdom of God in which righteousness dwells forever with the New Jerusalem, the composition of all the redeemed of God, as the center.
[188]  Second Peter 3:13 says that there will be a new universe in which righteousness dwells.
[189]  This indicates that everything in the new heaven and new earth will be altogether under God s government.
[190]  Righteousness is the main factor based upon which God s governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His old creation.
[191]  Hence, in Peter s Epistles, which are concerned with God s government, righteousness is stressed repeatedly 1 Pet 2:23-24; 3:12, 14, 18; 4:18; 2 Pet 1:1; 2:5, 7-8, 21; 3:13 .
[192]  The main matter seen in John s writings is God s love expressed in His life; in Paul s writings, God s grace distributed in His economy; and in Peter s writings, God s righteousness maintained in His government.
[193]  This righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth, saturating God s new universe prevailingly and thus maintaining it absolutely under God s righteous order.
[194]  The sons of God in verse 7 are those who have been born of God through regeneration John 1:12-13; 1 Pet 1:3-4, 23; James 1:18 ; they are built together through transformation 1 Cor 3:9-12; Eph 2:20-22; 1 Pet 2:4-6; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23-24 ; and they will be glorified in full to be the corporate expression of the processed Triune God Rom 8:29-30; Heb 2:10; Rev 21:11 .
[195]  Revelation 21:3 says, I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[196]  The peoples in this verse are not the sons of God but the restored nations.
[197]  The glory of God will illumine the New Jerusalem, and its lamp will be the Lamb v. 23 . For this reason, the city will have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will illumine it 22:5 . God Himself will be the light and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city.
