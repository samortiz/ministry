<li>Who Jesus is<br />
<span class="normal">Prove that Jesus is God.</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Who did the ancient people say that Jesus was?<br />
	The Jews said that Jesus was a carpenter from Nazareth. Others said that He was one of the prophets, and still others said that He was a holy man or a religious revolutionary. In other words, they all considered that He was no more than an ordinary man.</li>
	<li>Who does the Bible say Jesus is?<br />
	Chapter one of Matthew points out that Jesus had two names, Jesus and Immanuel (which is, God with us). According to this name (Immanuel), we know that the Lord Jesus is God with man. Jesus is God.</li>
	<li>The facts prove who the Lord Jesus is.<br />
	Church history over the past two thousand years has proved that Jesus is an extraordinary person. There is an extraordinary power in the Christian faith and its gospel has produced an extraordinary effect. This extraordinary One is God Himself.<br />
	<em>This point should be emphasized.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus is God coming as the Savior
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus means Jehovah the Savior. &ldquo;Je&rdquo; means Jehovah. When Jesus was born, an angel declared that His name should be called Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior.</li>
	<li>Jehovah is God.<br />
	He is God incarnated to be the Savior; therefore, this Savior is God become man. He is God as well as man. As God He is able to accomplish salvation for man; as man He can become the substitute for all men.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How did Jesus become man&rsquo;s Savior?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus was crucified. Describe how He bore our sins, shed His blood for us, and suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. Thus, He solved the problem of our sins.</li>
	<li>He was resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens to be the Almighty Savior for all mankind.</li>
	<li>As the Spirit, He entered into man to become man&rsquo;s living Savior, that man might be set free from sin. He was crucified and shed His blood to wash away all man&rsquo;s sins. He entered into us as the Spirit that we might be delivered from the power of sin and from our sinful living.</li>
	<li>By His death and resurrection and His descending as the Life-giving Spirit, He is able to save men from sins. Sin has its punishment, its power, and its living. The shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus makes it possible for man to be free from sin&rsquo;s punishment. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus and His descending as the Spirit enable man to be delivered from the power of sin and from sinful living. Therefore, He is able to save us out of our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How can man receive Jesus as Savior?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>By confessing that we were born in sin, brought up in sin, have lived in sin, and were also under the condemnation of sin.</li>
	<li>By repenting and confessing our sins.</li>
	<li>By confessing that the Lord Jesus died for our sins, that He was resurrected, and that He ascended to the heavens.</li>
	<li>By receiving the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
