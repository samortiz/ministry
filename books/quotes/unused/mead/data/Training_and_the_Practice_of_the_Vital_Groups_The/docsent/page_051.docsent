   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INCREASE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY IN NEW ZEALAND THROUGH THE SAINTS' LABORING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1970 a certain brother came into the Lord's recovery in New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later, he came to Los Angeles to see me purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I told him that the next year, 1971, I would go to New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I went to New Zealand through Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I traveled from Sydney through that large island to Melbourne.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time I did not meet anyone who had a heart for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then I went to New Zealand to see the brother who had visited me in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Previously, a dear saint whom I knew and who loved my books very much had visited that island and had brought with him two of my books, The All-inclusive Christ and The Economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As he was departing at the airport, he gave these two books to another man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While I was visiting New Zealand, I held a small conference there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time the man who had received the two books took a small plane across the island and was forced to stop in the city where I was.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He heard that I was speaking there, and he came to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through that conference he was caught by the Lord, and later his brother, who was a traveling preacher, also took the way of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the beginning of the Lord's recovery in New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, twenty-three years later, there are seven hundred New Zealanders in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, three hundred Chinese saints from Taiwan recently migrated to New Zealand, making a total number of one thousand saints in New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the Lord gave them a large piece of land, and now they have a training center with a full-time training on that land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the result of the saints' labor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a case should encourage us to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not know from where and when the fruit will come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been rejected, opposed, defamed, and criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The opposing ones have tried their best to blockade us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in the 1993 Thanksgiving Conference in Anaheim, the attendance in the last meeting was 3,260 adults plus more than 800 children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of those in the meetings were new faces to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Seemingly, we do not have much increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, that is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Chinese saints who immigrated from Taiwan to New Zealand are on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Recently, one of the couples from there told me that, because of their being there, another church was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They produced not only single believers but a church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not know where the fruit will come from.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 4:37-38 the Lord Jesus told us that others will sow the seed and we will reap what they have sown.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At other times we may sow the seed and others may reap.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 15:58, our labor in the Lord could never be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are lazy, we should not expect the angels to send anyone to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to know nothing but to labor with the full assurance that our labor will never be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LOVE BEING THE MOTIVATING POWER OF OUR LABOR</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our labor should be a labor of love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This love indicates that we love not only the Lord but also the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We love the stronger ones, and we love the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We love sinners; we love our friends; and we love our relatives, our classmates, and our colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We simply love people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Love is the motivating power of our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of this love we prefer to put aside many other things and to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not know who the fruit will be and from where and when it will come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We only know to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>LABORING WITH A VIEW FOR THE LONG RUN</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have been speaking for the Lord since July 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That was the beginning of my speaking to a church, not just to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I thank the Lord that today in a number of places on this earth I can see three generations of the fruit of my labor sitting in front of me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Dear saints, we should not be shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to have a view for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may be concerned because, after practicing the new way for some time, it seems that thus far we have seen little fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the fruit that is quick to come in will also be quick to be absent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The most enduring fruit is the fruit that is borne slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If within one week we gain one as a fruit, we should know that such a fruit may not live long.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if we spend two years to gain one, that one would never forget all the time that we spent laboring on him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was saved through a pastor's visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>My older sister recommended me to that pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then that pastor came to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times he spoke very little to me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He simply invited me to come to his church the next Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After visiting me for a number of months, at the end of the year, in December, he told me, "Mr. Lee, I will not come again until after the new year, because you have many things to do." He stopped coming, but on New Year's Day, I do not know why I had a thought to go to church, but I went.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>From that day I never left the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our labor is altogether not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If everyone will be faithful to labor with endurance, in two years we will see the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the one hand, time passes quickly; on the other hand, it passes very slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But those who labor do not care for the passing of time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They care only for their labor.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They care only to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When they visit people, people always consider their visit as something excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They visit people not in an ordinary way but in a very special way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This does not mean that they speak a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Perhaps they do not speak anything concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They simply go and visit others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This kind of visiting will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we speak too much, that will hinder our work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need further training on how to contact people and on how to speak and even not to speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are a blessed people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Wherever we go, blessing goes with us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whomever we visit will be visited by God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Those whom we visit will never consider our visit as something ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They may not say anything, but within them a deep impression will be sown into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even if we do not say anything, they know what our intention is in visiting them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They know that our intention is to gain them for Christ.</S>
