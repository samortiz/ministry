<h2 class="head2">B. Foolish Men Considering Service<br />to Be a Favor to God</h2><p>There are many people who think that they are granting God a favor by offering themselves to Him. Over the past decades, I have always felt uneasy when preachers pleaded with believers in revival meetings to give themselves to serve God. Many people give a little money to God and think that they are doing Him a special favor. Many people offer themselves to serve God and think that they are doing Him a favor. Some people think that they are bestowing honor upon God when they give up a little position in the world. Their hearts seem to be saying, "I give myself, someone as important as I, to serve God today!" Some give up their little positions and think that they are exalting the Lord. But this is blindness! This is nothing but folly and darkness!</p><h2 class="head2">C. Our Greatest Honor Being to Serve God</h2><p>If God in heaven has called us to be His priests, we should be on our knees before Him to receive His calling. This is our greatest honor. God has elevated us. We do not say that we can give anything to God. We say that our greatest honor lies in God's acceptance of what we offer to Him. What a tremendous honor that persons such as ourselves can serve God. This is pure grace! This surely is the gospel! It is not only a gospel about Jesus' salvation; it is a gospel that even persons such as ourselves can serve God. This is indeed the gospel, a great gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. UPHOLDING THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. There Being No Church<br />without the Universal Priesthood</h2><p>In the church today the priesthood is no longer restricted to only a few people; it has become a universal priesthood. The nation of Israel failed; the church cannot fail again. The nation of Israel failed in that God's people and God's priests became separated. May the Lord have mercy on us. May there be no separation between God's people and His priests in the church today. In the church God's people are His priests. All the people of God are priests of God. There must be as many priests as there are brothers and sisters. Everyone must come to God to offer up spiritual sacrifices and sacrifices of praise. Everyone should take part in spiritual service. This is not a selective ministry. Everyone should come to God to serve Him. A church that comes short of universal and direct access to God is not a church.</p><p>Please bear in mind that there is no church if the priesthood is not universal. The nation of Israel failed; the church should not fail again. During the past two thousand years, the scope of the priesthood has never been recovered to include all the people of God. The two thousand years of church history show us a frequent separation between the people and the ministry of the priests. An intermediary class has time and time again come between God and His people. This is the work and teaching of the Nicolaitans.</p><h2 class="head2">B. No Longer Tolerating the Intermediary Class</h2><p>We can no longer tolerate an intermediary class. We can no longer accept a hierarchy. We can no longer allow priests to stand between God and His children; we can no longer accept an intermediary class. We need to see what the church is. The church is the place where every child of God is a priest. We cannot have one person or a few persons monopolizing spiritual service. They cannot be the only ones through whom God speaks or the only ones through whom we approach God to settle spiritual matters. Such an intermediary class cannot exist in the church.</p><p>Our controversy with denominations is not a matter of outward forms but a matter of inward content. Today there is a hierarchy in the denominations&mdash;one group of people is serving God, while the rest are merely pew members. One group of people is serving God as a profession, while the rest of the pew members, though equally born to be God's children, need to approach Him through them. This hierarchical practice is tolerated by many organizations in Christianity today. But we cannot accept any intermediary class. We cannot set aside the grace given to the church in the New Testament. We cannot forsake it as the Israelites did.</p>
