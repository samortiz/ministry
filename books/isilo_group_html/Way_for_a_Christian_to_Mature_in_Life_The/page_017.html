TO BECOME THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>Starting in the garden of Eden, the God of creation began to work in us to make us pure gold and precious stones. When His work is done, we will be in the New Jerusalem. At that time we will not only be in the New Jerusalem, but we will also be able to say that we are the New Jerusalem. It is God who is working heaven into us, and it is God who is working us into the heavenlies (cf. Eph. 2:6). Heaven and man are becoming one. What is heaven? Heaven is the dwelling place of God. When the New Jerusalem is manifested, this dwelling place of God will be us, and we will be the dwelling place. Heaven is being built into us, and we are being built into heaven. We are not only being joined with God but also with heaven. Thus, God&rsquo;s thought is not merely that man would be saved, have his sins forgiven, and have God&rsquo;s life. God wants man to be transformed, to grow in life unto maturity, to let Christ be formed in him, and to be conformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image. Then man will be built up to become the New Jerusalem, the eternal Paradise.</p>
<p>We all need to see this light today. We have been saved, our sins have been forgiven, and we have God&rsquo;s life, but we still must grow in life and become mature. God would never put a man of clay in the New Jerusalem. Every stone built into the New Jerusalem is a precious stone that has been transformed by God. As soon as the life of God gets into man, transformation begins to take place within him to gradually build him into the New Jerusalem. Therefore, strictly speaking, we do not walk into the New Jerusalem. Rather, God works us into it. However, this requires the growth and maturity in life.</p>
<p>To be in the garden of Eden did not require the growth in life. Once man was created, he was put in the garden of Eden. Entering into the Paradise of Hades also does not require the growth in life. Believers simply enter into it when they die. However, to be in the Paradise of the New Jerusalem requires our whole being&mdash;our spirit and soul with our body&mdash;to be prepared and completely transformed. It requires the growth and maturity in life so that we may participate in God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place. The cleansing of the precious blood delivers us from sins so that we do not perish. However, whether we can be transformed to become building material for the New Jerusalem depends on the extent to which the life of God grows in us and transforms us. Everyone in the New Jerusalem is a precious stone, not a piece of clay. Thus, the goal of our salvation is not merely to believe but to grow. The goal is not to go to heaven but to grow in life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Way for a Christian to Mature in Life &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
