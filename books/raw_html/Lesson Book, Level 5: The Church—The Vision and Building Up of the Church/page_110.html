<p>Matthew 18:18 says, “Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in heaven.’’ Who are the “you’’ here? [They are the church, because in the preceding verse the Lord mentions the church. So that this is a continuation of verse 17. Therefore, the meaning of this verse 18 now before us is: that whatever things you the church shall bind on earth shall be (what has been) bound in heaven, and whatever things you the church shall loose on earth shall be (what has been) loosed in heaven.<p>Here lies a most important principle: God works through the church today; He cannot do whatever He desires to do unless He does it through the church. This is a most sobering principle. Today, God cannot do things by His own Self alone, because there is in existence another free will; without the cooperation of that will God is not able to do anything. The measure of the power of the church today determines the measure of the manifestation of the power of God.]<p>[This whole matter can be likened to the flow of water in one’s house. Though the water tank of the Water Supply Company is huge, its flow is limited to the diameter of the water pipe in one’s house. If a person wishes to have more flow of water, he will need to enlarge his water pipe. Today the degree of the manifestation of God’s power is governed by the capacity of the church. Just as at one time earlier when God manifested Himself in Christ, His manifestation was as large as the capacity of Christ; so now, God’s manifestation in the church is likewise circumscribed—this time by the capacity of the church. The greater the capacity of the church, the greater the manifestation of God, and the fuller the knowledge of God.]<p>[How many are the things which God wants to bind and to loose in heaven! Many are the people and things that are contradictory to Him; and all these God expects to be bound. Many also are those people and things that are spiritual, valuable, profitable, sanctified, and being of God; and these He anticipates to be loosed. But just here a problem arises: Will there be men on earth who will first bind what God wants to bind and loose what He intends to loose? God wills to have the earth govern heaven; He desires His church on earth to govern heaven.<p>This does not imply that God is not all-mighty, for He is indeed the Almighty God. Yet the all-mightiness of God can only be manifested on earth through a channel. We cannot increase God’s power, but we can hinder it. Man is not able to give increase to God’s power, nonetheless he can obstruct it. We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, yet we can restrict Him from doing that which He does want to do. Do we really see this? The church has a power by which to manage the power of God. She can either permit God to do what He wants or else prohibit Him from doing it.<p>Our eyes need to foreglimpse the future. One day God will extend His church to be the New Jerusalem, and at that time His glory will be fully manifested through the church without encountering any difficulty.] Today, God wants the church to loose on earth before He will accomplish on earth what has been loosed in heaven; He wants the church to bind on earth before He will accomplish on earth what has been bound in heaven. Heaven will not initiate things on earth. [Heaven will only follow earth in its working. God will not start first; He in His operation only follows the church. Oh, if this be the case, what a tremendous responsibility the church has!]
