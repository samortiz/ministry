<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>VOLUNTARY POVERTY<br>AND SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (23)</H1><P>Date:April 28, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:21-24</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VOLUNTARY POVERTY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Deliverance from Mammon to Serve God</H2><P>Matthew 6 shows us that if our eye is single, the whole body will be illuminated. Our eye has to be single. After this word, in the next verse the Lord speaks of the matter of serving the Lord. In the matter of serving the Lord, a man has to be single. No one can serve both God and mammon. In the first verse it mentions the eye being single, and in the next verse it mentions the service being single. Mammon is a serious thing. If a man wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from mammon. Those who are not delivered from mammon cannot serve God.</P><P>A single eye means an eye that is delivered from mammon. Only this kind of eye will enable one to see the truth. The truth is absolute; it has nothing to do with man. If a man does not know God, it is because his eyes are defiled and impure. In order for a man to know God, he must have eyes that are delivered from any defilements. An impure person cannot see the truth. In the eyes of a defiled person, everything is defiled. Such persons cannot see God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Voluntary Poverty<br>As a Result of the Lord's Salvation</H2><P>A Christian should consider mammon as a menace, something that needs to be disposed of right away. He should drop it in the same way he would throw away a piece of red-hot coal from his hand. A Christian's poverty should be one that is voluntary. Some become poor through their environment. Others are poor because of their parents or other special circumstances. But there is a certain kind of people who are poor because they have met salvation. They have chosen to become poor. There is a big difference between the last kind of poverty and all the other kinds of poverty. This is like being a soldier in the army: some are drafted, whereas others enlist themselves voluntarily.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>It Being Difficult for the Rich Man<br>to Enter God's Kingdom</H2><P>Why do we have to choose poverty? It is because the Bible says that it is difficult for a rich man to be saved. It is more difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of the heavens than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (Matt. 19:23-24). No rich man can enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Mammon Being an Idol</H2><P>Mammon is an idol. Covetousness is the same as idolatry (Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5). If you work in an office and others pay you with an idol or a golden calf, will you take it? Of course, you will not take it. But today, many people do not realize that mammon is the same as idols. It does not matter what kind of money it is; as long as it is mammon, it belongs to Caesar.</P>
