<h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT OF THE HOLY ONE</h2><p>In verse 17 Peter continues, &ldquo;And if you call upon as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one&rsquo;s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.&rdquo; In this verse Peter comes to the matter of God&rsquo;s government, the particular point that he covers in his Epistles. The judgment of God is for the carrying out of His government.</p><p>The Holy One who has called us as the Father has regenerated us to produce a holy family&mdash;a holy Father with holy children. As holy children, we should walk in a holy manner of life. Otherwise, the Father will become the Judge (4:17) to deal with our unholiness. He begat us with life inwardly that we may have His holy nature. He disciplines us with judgment outwardly that we may partake of His holiness (Heb. 12:9-10). His judgment is according to our work, our conduct, without respect of persons. Hence, we should pass the time of our sojourning in fear. If we call upon Him as our Father, we should also fear Him as our Judge and live a holy life in fear.</p><p>In verse 17 Peter &ldquo;is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul. In that sense &lsquo;the Father does not judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22). The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God&rsquo;s government in this world, exercised with regard to His children. Accordingly it says, &lsquo;the time of your sojourning&rsquo; here&rdquo; (Darby). This is God&rsquo;s judgment on His own household (1 Pet. 4:17).</p><p>Since these two Epistles are concerned with the government of God, the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly (2:23; 4:5-6,17; 2 Pet. 2:3-4, 9; 3:7), as one of the essential items. It began from the angels (2 Pet. 2:3-4) and passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament (2 Pet. 2:5-9). Then in the New Testament age it begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 1:17; 2:23; 4:6, 17) and continues until the coming of the day of the Lord (2 Pet. 3:10), which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium. After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish (1 Pet. 4:5; 2 Pet. 3:7), and the heavens and the earth will be burned up (2 Pet. 3:10b, 12). The results of the varied judgments are not the same. Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition. However, by all these judgments the Lord God will clear up the entire universe and purify it so that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness (2 Pet. 3:13) for His delight.</p><p>God judges according to each one&rsquo;s work without respect of persons. The work in verse 17 refers to conduct, behavior, as in Romans 3:20 and Galatians 2:16.</p><h2 class="head1">PASSING THE TIME OF OUR SOJOURNING IN FEAR</h2><p>In verse 17 Peter urges us to pass the time of our sojourning in fear. This is a holy fear, as in Philippians 2:12. It refers to a healthy, serious caution for us to behave in a holy manner. Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book because its teaching is concerning the government of God.</p> <p>To pass the time of our sojourning in fear means to walk in a holy fear of God all the time. The words &ldquo;pass the time&rdquo; include every minute of our daily life.</p><p>Years ago I visited some saints in Las Vegas. Certain of them suggested that I visit a gambling casino just to see what it is like. I replied, &ldquo;No, I shall not go. If it were not for your invitation, I would never come to this evil city. Because you have invited me, I am now here with you. But I will not go to see a gambling casino.&rdquo; If I had gone to such a place, then a certain amount of time that day would not have been passed in fear.</p><p>Every minute of our sojourning must be in fear. This is related to the holy manner of life. In all our manner of life we need to become holy, separated from the world.</p><p>Verses 18 and 19 explain why we should pass the time of our sojourning in fear: &ldquo;Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.&rdquo; Why should we pass the time of our sojourning in fear? Because we know that we have been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ. It is because we know this that we now pass the time of our sojourning in fear. The point here is that the holy manner of life should issue out from the dear and precious redemption of Christ.</p><p>Paul tells us that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of sin and from this evil age. Peter, however, tells us that Christ has redeemed us from the vain manner of life. It is vain to indulge in worldly entertainments or to purchase worldly clothing. The vain manner of life may also be related to the way we do our shopping. Some sisters very much like to go shopping. Every week they go to the department store at least to look around even if they do not buy anything. Do you not know who you are? You are sons and daughters of the King. As children of the King, you should not go to a department store in a light way. On the contrary, you should be stately and dignified even in your shopping. I use this as an illustration of being redeemed in a practical way from the vain manner of life.</p>
