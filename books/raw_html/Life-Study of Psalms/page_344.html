<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. He Having Restored Jerusalem</H2><P>Jehovah has restored Jerusalem, has strengthened its bars, and has blessed its people with peace and rich provision (vv. 12-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. He Declaring His Word to Jacob,<br>His Statutes and Ordinances to Israel</H2><P>"He declares His word to Jacob,/His statutes and His ordinances to Israel./He has not dealt so with any other nation;/And as for His ordinances, they have not known them" (vv. 19-20). Haggai and Zechariah could compare themselves with the Gentiles, boasting that, unlike them, the Gentiles did not have God's ordinances. Today we, the believers in Christ, do not have the statutes and ordinances but we do have the life-giving Spirit and the divine dispensing. What Haggai and Zechariah had cannot compare to what we have in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. PRAISING JEHOVAH FOR HIS EXALTED NAME<br>AND FOR HIS TRANSCENDING GLORY</H2><P>Psalm 148 is on praising Jehovah for His exalted name and for His transcending majesty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. All the Heavenly Things and Persons<br>to Praise Him from the Heavens</H2><P>In verses 1 through 6 all the heavenly things and persons are charged to praise Jehovah from the heavens. Concerning this, verse 5 says, "Let them praise the name of Jehovah;/For He commanded, and they were created."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. All the Earthly Things and Persons<br>to Praise Him from the Earth</H2><P>Verses 7 through 13 continue by saying that all the earthly things and persons are to praise Jehovah from the earth. Concerning this verse 13 says, "Let them praise the name of Jehovah,/For His name alone is exalted;/His glory is above the earth and the heavens."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. All His People to Praise Him</H2><P>According to verse 14, all His people, His saints, the children of Israel, a people near to Him, are to praise Him.</P>
