   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLY PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that if we would share in the building of God we must first enter into and experience all the items in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the experiences of the outer court deal only with the matter of righteousness; we must still have the experience of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The items which we have covered in the outer court merely establish the boundary line for God's building; they are not the actual building of the tabernacle itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must still experience the tabernacle, God's very building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the outer court are the brass, the silver, and the white linen, depicting God's judgment according to His righteous requirements, God's redemption, and God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But these only prepare us, making us fit initially for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must enter the tabernacle itself, that is, we must enter the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we enter the holy place, we are immediately impressed that everything is of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a lampstand made of pure and solid gold, and all the other items in the holy place are overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gold is everywhere!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Strictly speaking, God's building was built through brass, but not with brass.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was built with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gold typifies God's divine nature, that is, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His building is built through His judgment, but not with His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The material of God's building is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must have God's divine nature in order to be the materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How may we partake of God's divine nature?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By spiritually experiencing the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE SHOWBREAD TABLE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first item of the holy place is the table made of acacia wood overlaid with gold Exo 25:23, 24, 30; 40:22-23 , upon which was the bread, something good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This table spread with bread typifies Christ as our heavenly food; we may feed on Christ and enjoy Him as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Gospel of John portrays Christ as the bread of life, so available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we take Him in the form of food, we share the divine life with the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen that immediately after man was created, God put him before the tree of life that he might freely eat of that tree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that God presented Himself to man in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most of us have a mistaken concept concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We consider that He is so high and mighty and that we must bow and worship, prostrating ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But God wants us to take Him as food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He desires that we partake of Him inwardly more than worship Him outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a youth, I was taught after I was saved that I should be very quiet at the so-called Holy Communion table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was told that we must remember Jesus by concentrating all our thoughts in meditation upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But later, as I read the Scriptures, I discovered that I had not been taught properly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord told us, "Take, eat: this is my body, this do in remembrance of me" 1 Cor 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we take Him by eating of Him, we are really remembering Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The true remembrance of the Lord is not our meditation upon Him but our eating of Him, our partaking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's intention is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must consider Him as our food and partake of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus is our heavenly bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By eating this bread, something of "gold" will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we partake of Christ as food, the divine nature is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this heavenly bread of life are the "vitamins of gold."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Little children are often fooled by the "candy" given them by their mother.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They do not realize that they are actually taking candy-covered vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mother's intention is fulfilled in a pleasant way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our thought is that since we are really hungry, we need the Lord Jesus to satisfy us; so we fulfill our desire by eating the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But God's intention is to impart through the bread the "gold."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we are satisfied with Christ, we will also be full of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can verify this by our experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we are satisfied with the Lord Jesus, we also have the sense that we are full of God, that the divine nature has been imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The measurement of the showbread table is two cubits long and one cubit broad.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The number one stands for a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the table were foursquare, one cubit by one cubit, it would signify a complete unit; but here it is two cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This signifies a double unit, a double portion, that the table may be spread for people to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The height of the showbread table is the same size as that of the ark of testimony, one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that Christ as our food must come up to the standard of the testimony of God.</S>
