<p>In our contact with people we must discern matters. Although we cannot interfere in the matters that do not involve us, we should not neglect the matters that involve us. Hence, we must learn to discern matters. However, our learning should be gradual, not in haste.</p>
<p>In learning to know matters, several points require our attention. First, behind every matter is a person. When the person is right, the matter is often right. For this reason, we should always know who is the source of a matter. We need to know the initiator, the sponsor, of the matter. If there is a problem with the source, there will be problems even if the matter appears right. We need to get to the bottom of every matter.</p>
<p>Second, we need to know the motive behind a matter. A person may donate ten thousand dollars to win the praise of others. Another person may give ten thousand dollars because others rebuked him for not giving. The motive is wrong in both situations. We should pay attention to people&rsquo;s motives. This does not mean that everything is right when the motive is right. We also need to know if the nature is right. For example, a brother who desires something improper may receive help from another brother. Although the helping brother may be motivated by love, the object of his help is something that is improper.</p>
<p>Third, even if the nature is right, we need to know if the way of carrying it out is right. For instance, a brother who wants to make an offering of ten thousand dollars may simply present the money to us. We should help him to understand that this is not the right way. He should put the money in the offering box. We should teach him to pray in order to know the needs in the church. Then he will see that his offering is not for one individual or for one purpose. We teach him by fellowshipping with him. When he goes to the Lord, the church will be built up. On the one hand, we should not simply think that an offering of ten thousand dollars is wonderful; on the other hand, we should not casually reject him. We must learn the best way to take care of this matter and be aware of the result.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must know what the result of a matter will be. The way something is carried out may be good, but the effect might not be good. If the effect is not good, the matter should not be touched. This is only a brief sketch. The administration of the church, the ministry of the word, and the visiting of the saints should be carried out according to these considerations. If we practice this, it will be easy for us to discern matters. When we discern matters in this way, we will build up rather than damage the church. Therefore, we must learn to know the source and nature of a matter so that we can find an appropriate way to handle it for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>If there is a problem with the offering one, we should help him with his person. If he has a wrong motive, we should help him. If there is a problem with the way it is carried out, its result, or its effect, we should neither ignore the problem nor handle it casually, because it impacts the building up of the church. We should help the brother with the appropriate adjustment, help, and teaching. This will build up the church.</p>
<p>If we handle matters carelessly or neglect them, we will miss the opportunity to build up the church. We should understand every matter that comes to us, and we should grasp the opportunity to edify and teach those who are involved. This will build up the church. If the saints can receive the help from us in the matter of material offering, they will be genuinely edified. They will also be built into the church.</p>
<p>In our work and service we must realize that being proud is meaningless and that considering ourselves inferior is even worse. There is no value in thinking that we are always right; neither is there any value in thinking that we are always wrong. Both are incorrect and worthless. Whenever we encounter a person or a matter, we should learn to know the strengths and weaknesses of the person as well as the source and nature of the matters. In this way we will know how to help a person be built up into the church; we will know also how to handle the matter. This is building.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
