   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENTS OF THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What are the contents of the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From God's side the rearing up of the tabernacle begins from the west end where the ark is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But from our side it begins at the east end where the altar is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we come into the sphere of God's dwelling the first thing we have to contact is the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The altar deals with our sin and our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we offer the sin offering to deal with our sinful nature, our indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we offer the trespass offering to deal with our trespasses, transgressions, faults, offenses, and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unless the sin within you and the outward sins are dealt with, you are not allowed to go further to reach God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is at the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First you were wandering out in the world, but one day you heard the gospel and desired to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once you entered into the sphere of God's dwelling place you reached the cross typified by the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You heard the gospel that Jesus the Son of God died for your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You heard that He was the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There at the cross, at the altar, you said, "Lord Jesus, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You died for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You died for me, a sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After such a confession you were saved, you were forgiven, you were redeemed, you were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the altar there is not only the sin offering and the trespass offering but also the burnt offering and the meal offering Exo 40:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The burnt offering was only for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was the food to satisfy God's hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are not the only one who wants to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your hunger should remind you of God's hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You need to serve Him with some food by offering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What does it mean to offer Christ as food to God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, in our Christian experience we have realized this to some extent already.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we repented at the cross of Christ and received Him as our Savior and Redeemer, this was to take Him as our trespass offering and sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Simultaneously, we may realize that we can never please God and satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we would say, "Lord Jesus, You not only died for me and for my sins, but You also died to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have pleased God for me."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is to offer Christ as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe that a good number of newly saved persons had such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exodus 40 doesn't mention all the offerings; it only mentions the burnt offering and the meal offering v. 29 . After the burnt offering there was the meal offering which was food for God and also for the serving priests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After you have been saved you are no more sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, you are priests serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Outside of the outer court we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we got into the outer court and we experienced Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering at the cross, the altar, we got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Right away the sinners became priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So we need to eat the priestly food, not the secular food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is not only for God's satisfaction, but also for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We eat Him, and this is the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although you may not have received this kind of teaching in the past, you surely had the experience to some extent.</S>
