   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S BLOOD ALONE BEING DRINKABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was in the Philippines, a sister asked me, "At the time of the flood, man could not take blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the dispen- sation of the law, man could not take blood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament time of the apostles, man still could not take blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why was man not able to take blood during all three dispensations?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know there are four dispensations in the Bible: The dispensation of the patriarchs and the dispensation of the law have passed, and the dispensation of the kingdom has not arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the dispensation of the patriarchs, God charged Noah not to eat blood Gen 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the dispensation of the law, God also charged Moses not to eat blood Lev 17:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When it comes to the dispensation of the apostles, God also forbade men to take blood Acts 15:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I asked her, "Do you take blood?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She replied, "The Bible says that we should not take it; therefore, I have never taken blood."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I said, "Then next time I dare not break bread with you, because you have not yet been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You deserve to go to the lake of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She said, "Why?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have never taken blood."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I said, "I have taken it."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After I explained how I had taken "blood," she said, "In that case I have taken it as well!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers and sisters, the Bible says that we should not take blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Jesus stood up one day to announce that His blood was true drink John 6:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's intention is for us to only take a certain kind of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the entire universe there is only one kind of blood that we can take.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that in the entire universe there is only one salvation and only one Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only this blood can accomplish redemption before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we reject this blood, there will be no other sacrifice for sins Heb 10:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not take this blood, there is no other blood we can take.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the only Savior, and there is no other salvation under heaven or on earth Acts 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have all taken this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible forbids the taking of other blood so that we would only take this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Please remember that whenever the Bible speaks of blood, it refers directly or indirectly to the righteous requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only the blood of Jesus can accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only His blood can bring about God's redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the blood of Jesus, man's sins before God are taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE RESURRECTION OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BEING FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know that the Father sent the Son to shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the shedding of blood, He could forgive us in a most righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But how do we know that the blood of Jesus cleanses us of all sins?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Two thousand years ago He bore our sins and died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How do we know that God is satisfied with the blood?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How do we know that it can redeem us from our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How do we know that it is trustworthy?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose God said that it was not adequate, what would we do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose God said that one Savior is not enough, and that there needs to be two.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose He said that one shedding of the blood is not enough, and that it needs to be shed again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What would we do then?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know that the blood is God's demand; God's righteous judgment required the Lord to shed His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But how do we know that this judgment is adequate?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How do we know that it has satisfied God's righteous requirements?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise God that He not only caused Christ to die, but He also raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Resurrection is God's response to the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the blood was offered to God, God responded with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The blood is something man sends to God, whereas resurrection is something God sends to man after He has accepted the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord said, "If I be lifted up..."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For whom was the Lord lifted up?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was lifted up to God for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once God was satisfied with His death, He resurrected Him from the dead as a proof for all to believe Acts 17:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible does not ask us to believe in the death of Christ; rather, it asks us to believe in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we read our Bibles a few more times, we will be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Tonight I am sweeping away trash with a broom in my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we tell others to believe in the Lord, we often tell them to believe in the Lord's death and to be saved by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But where in the Bible does it say to believe in the Lord's death?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where does it tell us to believe that the Lord has shed His blood to be the Savior of man?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people are preaching doctrines that are not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of course, we should not spread the word that Mr. Nee is telling people not to believe in the Lord's death and not to believe that the Lord's blood is for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What I mean is that the Bible tells us to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not tell us to believe in the Lord's death but in His resurrection Rom 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we believe in the Lord's resurrection, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Bible charges us to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It does not charge us to believe in His death, but in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Perhaps my words seem confusing to you, but please remember that the blood is a matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is up to God to say whether the blood is sufficient for redemption; we do not need to worry about it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God considered the blood to be sufficient for redemption; therefore, He raised Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once we see that the Lord has been resurrected, we know that the Lord's blood is trustworthy, that it is able to take away our sins, and that we can be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Romans 4:25 shows the relationship of the Lord's death and resurrection to us: Jesus was delivered for our offenses, and He was resurrected for our justification.</S>
