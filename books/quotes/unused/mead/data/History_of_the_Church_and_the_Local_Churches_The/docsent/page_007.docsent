   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16; Phil 3:5-8; Col 1:18-19; 2:2-3, 6-10; 3:10-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope that we can take some time to pray-read the verses in the Scripture reading at the beginning of each chapter especially chapters one and two , so that we can be deeply impressed with them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that these verses are very revealing and enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are deeply impressed with them, we will see what the real church life is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses can convey to us a complete and clear vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>NO HIERARCHY IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 20 and 23, the Lord Jesus told us clearly that among His disciples there should not be any kind of human rule or human position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the Epistles reveal that the elders are the leading ones in the churches Heb 13:7, 17, 24 , they are not taking the lead according to the human, worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elders are not leaders in a positional or hierarchical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They have to be the examples, taking the lead to follow the Lord's way, and they should not exercise any lordship over the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is clearly taught in 1 Peter 5:1-3 and 1 Timothy 3:1-7.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be under the influence of the worldly understanding when we talk about leadership in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the world the leaders have authority over others and rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the churches, the elders are the leading ones, but they are not rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They should be examples, taking the lead to serve and care for the church so that the believers may follow in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The elders also function to take oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We pointed out in chapter one that the Greek word for overseer is episkopos.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Epi means over and skopos means seer, implying view or sight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders should function to look into the situation of the church with an overview.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps some in the church would go astray or would bring in sinful, worldly things that would insult the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the elders have to do something to keep the church in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not consider the elders as worldly rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are only the examples, taking the lead to follow the Lord's way, and the saints should follow their example.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elders are also overseers who take the oversight in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are watching to keep anything sinful or idolatrous from being brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to stress that there should not be any rank or position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any hierarchy in the church is abominable to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a shame that those in the Catholic Church call their priests "father."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 23:9-10 the Lord said, "And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we want to be great, we should be a servant, a bond slave v. 11 . The greatest one among us is our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are we willing to be slaves to the brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be slaves, serving the brothers and sisters and ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 20:25-28 and 23:8-12 are very important portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Based upon these two portions of the Word, there is no ground for any kind of hierarchy or clergy in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said that we are all brothers 23:8 .</S>
