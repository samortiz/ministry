   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The previous five lessons covered the believers' experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Beginning with this lesson we will go on to see the believers' experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the New Testament, grace is what Christ is to us for our enjoyment John 1:16-17 , that is, Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 experienced and enjoyed by us through the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The love of God is the source, the grace of Christ is the course, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission of the course with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, grace issues from God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine love is with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this love comes with the Son, it becomes grace John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, grace is not separate from love; love and grace are one reality in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With the Father we experience and enjoy the divine love; with the Son we experience and enjoy the divine grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I. AS OUR PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace, we enjoy Him as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Colossians 1:12 Paul speaks of Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word for portion here may also be translated "lot."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul used this term with the allotment of the good land among the Israelites in the Old Testament as the background.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among the twelve tribes, every tribe was given a lot, a portion of the good land, as their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, as the New Testament believers, we do not have the physical land as our portion; rather, our portion is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the portion of the saints, Christ becomes our divine inheritance for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is "theirs and ours."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all the believers, for He is the portion given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of such a Christ v. 9 , that is, a fellowship in which we partake of the union with, and participate in, God's Son, Jesus Christ, that we may have Him as our portion.</S>
