 <h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SING AND TO READ THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>Whenever I sing, I come alive. While I take a walk, I sing one hymn after another:</p>
<p class="hbody">Evil ways you are treading,<br />
Traps there are before you,<br />
If you turn not, awaiting ahead<br />
Is the pit of perdition.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn">Chinese <em>Hymns,</em> #715</p>
<p>Sometimes I sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">Hark! the herald angels sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Glory to the new-born King;<br />
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God and sinners reconciled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #84</p>
<p>At other times I sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
Though all things around us be trying,<br />
Though floods of affliction....</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #717</p>
<p>Then I may sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Jesus came into my heart!...</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #309</p>
<p>Sometimes I sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ the Savior is just the One you need,<br />
He&rsquo;s God incarnate, as a man indeed;<br />
In His body....</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #1024</p>
<p>There are so many hymns for us to sing.</p>
<p>If an old person such as me can sing this way, you can do even better. Sing in your daily life. Even the more, sing in the meetings. This kind of singing is surely scriptural; it comes from a walk that is according to the Spirit. Even the more, it is an overflow of being filled with God in spirit. Now let me ask you a question: If I were to say, &ldquo;I am about to get angry,&rdquo; what hymn do you think I should sing? I would take the tune of &ldquo;You Need Jesus&rdquo; and sing it with the words, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, don&rsquo;t be angry.&rdquo; If a couple is arguing, and their child would sing to them this song, the couple would feel very shameful for arguing.</p>
<p>The reasons the home meetings are not living are first a lack of speaking, and second a lack of singing. We all must learn to sing hymns. We should not only read the Bible; we must also read the hymns. I like very much the song:</p>
<p class="hbody">All the way to Calvary He went for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went for me, He went for me;<br />
All the way to Calvary He went for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died to set me free.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #994</p>
<p>Then, there is hymn 986:</p>
<p class="hbody">What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Savior;<br />
What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord!</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #986</p>
<p>There is also hymn 322:</p>
<p class="hbody">Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,<br />
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;<br />
Finding joy and pleasure in abounding measure,<br />
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #322</p>
<p>When I sing in this way, all my worries are gone and all the sicknesses are removed. Praise the Lord for giving us so many good hymns.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, why would you not sing? We all have to repent for not singing and praising. We all want the meetings to be living. Why then do we wait? Why do we not sing some hymns?</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO BRING IN A REVIVAL</h2>
<p>If a brother reads the Bible daily, sings constantly with joy, prays without ceasing, does not quench the Spirit, and does not despise the word of prophecy, do you think he will skip the home meetings? Will he sit at home when it is time for the home meeting? I told you yesterday that I understand that you are all very busy. But we are only asking you to attend three important meetings in a week: the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning truth meeting, the evening table meeting, and one home meeting. You cannot excuse yourself from any of these three meetings.</p>
<p>I would ask all the brothers and sisters to pick up the burden to pray for the evangelization of Taiwan. This will be accomplished through the home meetings and through the producing of the full-timers. The full-timers will be sent to many different places. We must pray for this. Our prayer should be the track for the train to run on. May the Lord remember this move, and may all the saints pick up this burden faithfully for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. If we produce five hundred full-timers each year, the expense will be very great. But without the full-timers we cannot do anything. The move and living of the full-timers must be supported by the church. Prayer plus the faithful supply is the only way we can possibly evangelize Taiwan. Otherwise, even if we have the heart, we will not be able to do it.</p>
<p>Concerning the meeting hall in Lin-Ko, we have not yet done anything outwardly, but much has been planned. The brothers who are mainly responsible for the design are in the United States. It is not a small thing to build a large meeting hall on thirty-seven and a half acres. The main work will be the building itself. We intend to build it ourselves. Some brothers will come from the United States to help. Also, some help will be raised up locally. This will be more economical and practical. I estimate that after we obtain the permits from the government, we will start the construction work immediately, and the project will be completed by 1988. I hope that you brothers and sisters will match this move with your prayers.</p>
<p>If you are led by the Lord to offer materially, I suggest that you not hold back your desire to offer. Do not wait until the last minute to offer a large amount of money. The best way is to give weekly or monthly.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that He has given us such a fellowship this evening. I have presented to you almost everything concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move in the church. I believe we all will be faithful in practicing the home meetings. As I said in the previous message, &ldquo;Heaven may pass away, and the earth may be annulled, but the home meetings must never be forsaken.&rdquo; I believe also that we will all practice one-on-one, making home deliveries, and giving injections at home. At the same time I trust that you will remember the move to produce the full-timers and that you will pray for their needs and training. I trust that you will cooperate with the Lord in love. The more the home meetings develop, the more urgent the need will be for the large meeting hall. If we all realize the present situation, we will put forth our effort and we will pick up the burden for prayer. The Lord will add to us everything we need for the spread of His work here in Taiwan.</p>
