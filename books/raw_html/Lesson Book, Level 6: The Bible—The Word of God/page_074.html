<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>There are five books in the Bible considered to be poetry: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. The book of Lamentations is also poetic in form, but it is considered as a supplement to the book of Jeremiah, even referred to as &ldquo;the Second Book of Jeremiah&rdquo; by some ancient writings; therefore, it is not included among the books of poetry.</p>
<p>The content of the books of poetry is the various spiritual experiences gained by the people of God in their living, expressed through poetry as they were moved by the Holy Spirit; it is the pouring out of their hearts. So, the poetry in the Bible is not abstract, impractical, or unrealistic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. JOB</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: There is great contention about the authorship of the book of Job. [The things recorded in this book took place before the time of Moses and may have been concurrent with Abraham, which is about two thousand years before Christ. Some have said it was written by Elihu, and some have said that Moses was probably the author.] Job lived in Uz, in the southern part of Edom, west of the Arabian plain, at the border of Canaan. Uz belongs to Edom (Lam. 4:21). The events recorded in this book probably took place within one year&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>B. The subject: God&rsquo;s people having deeper and higher visions and experiences of God in spite of Satan&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>C. The background: Job was blameless and upright before God. He was one who feared God and shunned evil. He became a glory to God before Satan. Satan thought that Job loved God because God blessed him with many physical blessings, so he requested and received God&rsquo;s permission to test him by destroying everything he had. Ultimately, God and Job triumphed. Job was proven to love God regardless of his outward situation, and Satan was defeated.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: God allows Satan to attack godly people so that they may have deeper experiences and visions. We may not understand why certain things happen, but we believe &ldquo;that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God&rdquo; (Rom. 8:28).</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: God boasted of Job before Satan. Satan accused Job before God twice. He obtained permission to ruin what Job had and to cause Job to suffer. During Satan&rsquo;s attack, Job&rsquo;s three friends came to visit. They tried to comfort Job during his suffering, but, because they did not know God&rsquo;s will, they could only offer their opinions. Job was somewhat affected by them. Elihu, a young man, having more knowledge of God, spoke something better; however, because he lacked maturity, he also was unable to help Job.</p>
<p>When God appeared and spoke to Job face to face, he understood what was going on. He saw God. He knew God. All his problems were solved. Praise the Lord! What we need is to contact God.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1&mdash;2:10), 2) Job and his three friends (2:11&mdash;31), 3) Job and Elihu (chs. 32&mdash;37), 4) Job talking to God face to face (ch. 38&mdash;42:9), and 5) conclusion (42:10-17).</p>
