   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians know something concerning the cross, but they are not clear concerning the principle of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the principle of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the Scriptures, God has two creations in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is called the old creation, and the second, the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The new creation came into being by putting the old creation to an end and beginning something new.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only by putting the old creation to an end could the Lord bring the new creation into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was through the work of the cross that the old creation was put to an end, and it was through the cross that the new creation began in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE ITEMS OF THE OLD CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What are the constituents of the old creation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first item in the old creation is the angels with the angelic life, and the second is man with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are two kinds of beings with two kinds of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The archangel, the head of the angels, rebelled against God and became Satan Isa 14:12-14; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>28:12-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word satan means adversary, indicating that Satan is the adversary of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan not only rebelled, but he led a rebellion against God in which a good number of angels followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to Revelation 12, one-third of the angels, the heavenly stars, followed Satan v. 4a . These rebellious angels became the spiritual forces of evil the rulers, authorities, and world-rulers in Satan s dark kingdom, as mentioned in Ephesians 1:21; 2:2; and 6:12.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The rebellion of the angelic life produced the third and fourth items of the old creation Satan and his kingdom Matt 12:26; Luke 4:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now let us briefly continue with the other items of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the creation of the human life, the enemy of God also induced man to act against God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This act caused something sin to be injected into the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This sin was the singular, personified sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The very sinful nature and thought of Satan was injected into the human life Gen 3:1-6; Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sin in this universe was invented by the injection of the fallen angelic life into the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin was not created by God but was invented by the illegal union of the satanic life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, sin is the fifth item in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After singular sin came into existence, it brought forth many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, sins as the fruit of sin 6:20-21; 7:5 , including lying, murder, pride, fornication, etc., are the sixth item in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the sins of man were produced from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The world is the seventh item in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The world was not created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God created the earth, but Satan invented the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sin was invented in Genesis 3, but it was not until Genesis 4 that something was added to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This added thing was Satan s invented world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is the world?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The world is the system of all human life under Satan John 12:31; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word for world is kosmos, which means order or arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It denotes an ordered system set up by Satan, the adversary of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God created man for Himself, but now Satan has systematized humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man is no longer for God but is wholly systematized by Satan and for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Another item besides these in the old creation is death, which is the consequence of sin and sins Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The flesh the transmuted body, poisoned and ruined by Satan 7:18; 8:3 is also an item in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The body became the flesh through the corruption of Satan as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The old man 6:6 is another item, which is nothing less than the entire fallen man ruined by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man, who was originally created by God, has been ruined by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The next item in the old creation is the self Luke 9:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The soul of man was created by God Gen 2:7 , but it has become the self, which is threatened and corrupted by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God originally created the body as a good and pure thing, but it was corrupted by Satan s sinful nature and became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The same principle applies to the soul, which was created pure and good but later was influenced by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was threatened and then controlled by the flesh and thereby became the self.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sin corrupted the body, causing it to become the flesh, and the flesh influenced and controlled the soul, making it the self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Finally, the twelfth item in the old creation is the entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The entire creation was damaged and corrupted by the rebellion of the angelic life and by the transgression of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This brought the entire creation under a kind of groaning because of the bondage of corruption Rom 8:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE CENTER OF THE OLD CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The aforementioned twelve items added together are the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The old creation includes many things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But we need to be clear at this point that fallen man became the very center of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is related to each one of the twelve items of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First, Satan entered into man and became one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Included with Satan is the kingdom of Satan; therefore, since Satan is in man, the kingdom of Satan also is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Satan is the ruler of the world; hence, the world too is included in Satan 1 John 5:19b and also is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, embodied in man are sin and sins, which issue in death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The flesh, the old man, and the self also are in man, and man was, and still is, the head of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to Genesis 1:26, man was ordained to be the head of the entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, man is related to the entire creation, and the entire creation is related to man and centralized in man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Man is the very center of the old creation in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man nearly becomes all-inclusive, but not in a good sense.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we want to meet Satan, there is no need for us to go to some special place by going to man, we will meet Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we desire to contact the kingdom of Satan, there is no need for us to go to the moon by going to man, we will contact the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is the same with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Within man, as the representative of the old creation, are Satan, the kingdom of Satan, the world, sin, sins, death, the flesh, the old man, etc. Man is not a small creature.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the contrary, man is great and all-inclusive in a negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The entire creation is now centralized in man.</S>
