<h2 class="head1">PAUL COMPLETING THE REVELATION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:25 Paul says, &ldquo;I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.&rdquo; This means that although God spoke in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, He did not finish speaking. The Lord spoke further in the Gospels, but He did not finish speaking; He did not say everything. Therefore, Paul became a minister to complete the word of God. This can be likened to making a garment; unless the collar is attached, the garment is not yet complete. The Old Testament can be likened to the main body of the garment, and the four Gospels can be likened to the sleeves. However, the garment is still missing a collar. Paul&rsquo;s ministry added a &ldquo;collar&rdquo; to the &ldquo;garment&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s speaking. The word of God, the revelation of God, is complete with the addition of Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Paul completed the word of God by completing the revelation of God.</p>
<p>A person who reads the Old Testament, the Gospels, and Acts but not the Epistles of Paul has not read the complete word of God; he is missing the central revelation. The central revelation is not in the Old Testament, the Gospels, or Acts but in Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. We can say that the fourteen Epistles of Paul completed the revelation of God. God spoke much in the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in Acts, but His word was not completed. Paul became a minister of the church and was entrusted with completing and finishing the word of God.</p>
<p>Concerning completing the word of God, Colossians 1:26-27 says, &ldquo;The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; The mystery is Christ; hence, the completing word is also Christ. Some may question why we say that the word of God was not completed in the Gospels, even though the four Gospels speak of Christ. The Gospels mainly show how the Lord was incarnated, lived on the earth, went to the cross, died to accomplish redemption, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens. The Gospels do not elaborate on this incarnated Christ who died, resurrected, and ascended to the heavens to become the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit. Paul became a minister of the church in order to complete the word of God. This completing word, which was a hidden mystery, is &ldquo;Christ in you.&rdquo; Christ in us is the completion of the word of God and the completion of the revelation of God.</p>
<p>The completing word is not in the Old Testament or in the Gospels or in Acts; the completing word is in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. In the Gospels this completing word is briefly mentioned in John 14 and 15. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo; (14:16-17), and &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (15:4). John did not elaborate on this word. Christ&rsquo;s abiding in us, as well as His incarnation, death, resurrection, and becoming the life-giving Spirit in order to indwell us are particular to Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Paul elaborated on these points. This is Paul&rsquo;s ministry, the &ldquo;collar of the garment,&rdquo; the center of God&rsquo;s revelation. Without Paul&rsquo;s ministry the revelation of God is not complete.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s ministry completed the word of God. Even though God spoke in forty-four books&mdash;thirty-nine books in the Old Testament, four books of the Gospels, and the Acts&mdash;He had not finished speaking. Paul received a particular commission to complete the revelation of God. Hence, Paul&rsquo;s ministry was to complete the word of God.</p>
