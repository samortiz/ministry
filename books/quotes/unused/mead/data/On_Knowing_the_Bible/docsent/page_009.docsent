   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE COMPLETION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today, we will consider how the Bible was completed based on the historical facts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will also consider when it was written and how it was accepted after being written.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although these are only some facts, they are intimately related to us as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. BEFORE THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN A. Without the Written Revelation of God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first 2500 years of human history, there were no written revelations of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were only His verbal instructions, such as His instructions to the forefathers, including Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis we see that before the Bible was written, God often appeared to the forefathers and gave them verbal instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. There Being Instructions Handed Down through Oral Tradition</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the Bible was written, although there were no written revelations of God, there were verbal instructions handed down from generation to generation by the fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This fact can be proved from inscribed stone tablets discovered in Egypt and Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1901, a black pillar was discovered in Persia on which were inscribed some of the laws of the ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of them were similar to the Law of Moses, yet it was inscribed five to six hundred years before the time of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This proves that before the Bible was written, among ancient civilizations, there were verbal instructions of God handed down through their forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. The Ancient Languages</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to know how the Bible was written, we need to know about the alphabets and languages used by the ancient civilizations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Akkadian</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before the flood, it is not known what language man used.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to historical research, the earliest language spoken by man after the flood came from Akkad in the northwest region of ancient Babylon and is called Akkadian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The three terms, "Adam," "Eden," and "Sabbath" in the book of Genesis chapter two are probably Akkadian and not Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Akkadian was originally made of lines.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These lines were drawn into wedge shapes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually the writing developed into the cuneiform script.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This script was used until approximately two thousand years before Christ, about the time of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Babylonian Writing of the Tribe of Shem</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From about two thousand years before Christ, the Babylonian writing of the tribe of Shem replaced Akkadian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We believe that this is the origin of the Aramaic language that came later.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of writing was used until approximately six hundred years before Christ, at the time Nebuchadnezzar ruled in Babylon.</S>
