   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE SERVICE OF THE ELDERS AND DEACONS IN THE CHURCH 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for the service and the leading in the church in Taipei to have a new beginning, we want to have some fellowship and leading for the newly appointed elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will first fellowship concerning the Lord s move in the church in Taipei as well as on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were led by the Lord to come here in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was thirty-six years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the Lord s mercy, we had a very good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though we were hindered in some aspects of the work and have not completely followed the Lord s leading, the Lord has kept us so that His testimony has been maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we began, our scope in the work was not large, but by the Lord s blessing we now have a rich heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Under Brother Nee s ministry we learned a lesson concerning the importance of the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, I received a burden from the Lord for the past eleven years to preserve in printed form all the truth and light and knowledge of the Bible that we have received from the Lord so that these precious messages would not be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Contact with Brother Nee</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before 1950 I co-worked with Brother Nee for nearly twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We had a very close relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever he saw and what grace he received, he would fellowship with me in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have not seen another brother who surpassed Brother Nee in knowing the Lord, spiritual matters, life, and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>None can surpass Brother Nee, and there are none who are within reach of him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I received the Lord s mercy to recognize the treasure within our brother, and I received Brother Nee s leading from the depth of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By his contact with me, he got to know me and was open to me and appreciative of me in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He also trained me and perfected me in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being Sent by Brother Nee to Taiwan</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later I was sent to Taiwan to begin the work and continue the ministry of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eleven years ago, when I was in America, I received a burden to put all the truths that the Lord has shown us into books.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee s knowledge of the truth was very deep and very broad.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He once expressed the desire to write notes to the New Testament, but God never gave him the opportunity to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Nee knew so much, but very little of what he knew was put in writing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He spoke many messages, but not many of his messages were put in print.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What remains with us from our brother are the books that we have today, but they cannot compare to what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Based on this experience, beginning in 1974 I had a burden to hold bi-annual life-study trainings in America.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the past eleven years, I buried myself in the life-studies, ignoring other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since beginning the life-study training, I returned to Taiwan in 1975, in 1977 for a conference, in 1979 on my way to the Philippines, in 1981 after visiting Hong Kong to speak on church history, and again last year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During these visits I was mostly just passing through.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Receiving the Burden to Return to Taiwan</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1979 I began to feel that the development of the church in Taipei had stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1984 I felt that there was a need for me to return, especially to Taipei, to mobilize the work for a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Last fall when I finished writing the Life-study for the last book in the New Testament the book of Acts I was clear inwardly that I should return to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I received a fresh burden for the work in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that I will completely drop the work in America.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From 1949, when I began the work in Taiwan, until I went to America was about thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During those years I spent four months every year in Southeast Asia and eight months in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord allows it, I believe that for the next several years I will spend four to five months every year in Taiwan: two months in the first half of the year and another two months in the second half of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I would like to work together with the brothers to promote the Lord s testimony on this island.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please pray for my traveling between Taiwan and America, because my returning is not merely for a conference or for a visit but that I have received a fresh burden for Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This burden differs from the burden of the work in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time we did not have even one meeting hall on the island, and there were only a few hundred saints here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition, the island of Taiwan was backward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The streets were unpaved, and most of the residents wore wooden clogs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today s situation is different.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With respect to the church, there are already more than forty localities with close to ten thousand saints attending the meetings every week.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In addition, the society, economy, and education in Taiwan have been blessed by the Lord such that Taiwan is suitable to propagate the gospel work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1949 I was pushing a tricycle, but today we are pushing a train.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The responsibility is heavy and great.</S>
