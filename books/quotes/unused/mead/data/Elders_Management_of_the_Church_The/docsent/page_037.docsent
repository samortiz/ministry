   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING ACCOMMODATING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>An elder should have still another item of character, that of accommodating others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have mentioned this point before and have called this character trait one that can be compared to glue; glue may be applied to a horizontal surface, a vertical body, a bump, a hole, or a corner.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It can be accommodated to fit any shape.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether an object is a bump or a hole, crooked or straight, level or slanted, it can be applied to it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>An elder must be able to accommodate others in a similar way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, although we speak of accommodation, this should not be something done artificially.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An elder must have a thorough, diligent, and stable character.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He must be concerned for others and must be accommodating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have these five elements in your character, you will definitely manage a church well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not denying the importance of being spiritual, of which I have already spoken much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you are really spiritual, yet you lack these few character traits, your spirituality is still useless, and it still amounts to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spirituality can be compared to the ingredients, whereas character is the man himself behind the ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's character is composed of his natural disposition plus his habits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The character represents the person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are slow, it is the person who is slow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are fast, it is the person who is fast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are careless, it is the person who is careless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are thorough, it is the person who is thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are such a person because you are constituted with such a character.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person may not necessarily produce something good simply because the ingredients are good; much depends on the worker who works on the ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If your character is poor, even if you have spiritual experiences, there will be no way for them to be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Dear brothers and sisters, this is not a great doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, I have full assurance, and I can lay down my life to guarantee that if an elder is not a thorough, diligent, stable person, and is not concerned for others, neither accommodating others all the time, he will never function well as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To have such elders in a church is like having no elders at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only those elders who are thorough, diligent, stable, concerned for others' affairs, and trying their best to accommodate others will be able to manage a church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we have such elders, we can thank and praise the Lord, for that church will surely have a bright future, and much spiritual blessing will be brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers, the elders among us are not professionals; they serve altogether out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We function as elders because we love the Lord, the church, and every member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if we pour out all the days of our life and our very life itself upon the church, it is worthwhile, and we are still willing to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This matter is bound up with the salvation of millions of souls; it is also bound up with the building up of millions of souls.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How exceedingly glorious a work this is!</S>
