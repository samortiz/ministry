   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BURDEN AND PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO REALIZE THIS GLORIOUS FUTURE Building Up the Home Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What should we do to bring in this glorious future and reach our goal?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the elders in every local church should pick up the burden to build up the meetings in the saints homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every saint should have a meeting in his or her own home.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Last month there were forty-five hundred saints attending the home meetings in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now the number has reached fifty-one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should be encouraged to continue advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, we are not for numbers only.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our emphasis is to build up the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The home is a steady and stabilizing unit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who are saved in the homes grow up in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since they are built up in the homes, it is not easy to lose them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past the church life was like a social club.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a person was saved, he was frequently ignored because of lack of care and concern.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the church must be built up in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person is saved and baptized, he will not be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, the fruit will remain and be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that the elders will see this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have no intention to build up the big meetings centered on the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are for building up the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The home is the base for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the basic building unit of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean that we will give up the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The halls are a means and a bridge for us to take advantage of and cross over.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our real goal is to build up the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there are one thousand saints, there should be one thousand active homes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there are ten thousand saints, there should be ten thousand active homes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there are ten thousand homes in Taipei, and if every home brings in one person a month, in one year we will bring in one hundred twenty thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we take the old way, how many elders and co-workers will we need to appoint to take care of one hundred twenty thousand people?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the new way no such appointments are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the homes can take care of these people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we speak, the clearer we are concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the life pulse of the new system, and it must succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With this in view, we should pay much attention to the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A plan has already been drafted with the trainers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the future the full-time training will be carried out in the Full-time Training Center in hall three of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the trainees must reside in the center.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some churches may not be very happy about sending all these good young people to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may ask, What about our own locality?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers, we need to have proper foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not let localism blind us from seeing the overall future of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These young people are being trained here temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the long run they will serve in all the localities according to the need.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For the sake of the overall enterprise of the Lord s recovery, the elders and responsible brothers in all the churches should do their best to encourage the young people to attend the training and to send them on their way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to meet the need of the full-time training and of the gospelization of Taiwan, there is a great need of financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The need for the full-time training alone presents a great burden to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From the beginning, I fellowshipped that in the churches one out of every twenty saints should be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The other nineteen should support his living and training.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the churches should strive toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the same time we should do our best to be faithful in material giving.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may say that the training and giving should be up to the Spirit s leading and stirring and that there should not be any human arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But we need to understand that even though our personal walk should follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, the move of the entire church should issue from the leading of the Holy Spirit through the apostles and elders instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Paul s Epistles, he directed Timothy and arranged for the movements of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord willing, we should even specify the way we should dress and the way furniture should be arranged in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every time we meet, we are before God; therefore, we need to be serious about our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we act loosely and carelessly, as we have in the past, we will be selling the Lord s recovery too cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the previous chapter I mentioned a heretical group in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In their meetings everyone dresses properly and puts on proper attire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason high-class people are attracted to them and even pride themselves in being members.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should pay attention to this and reexamine ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some may say that if we do this, we will be like those in James 2, who respect persons and prefer the rich to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My response to this is from 1 Corinthians 11.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the time of the apostle Paul, when believers frequently gathered together for meals, the rich would bring better and finer food while the poor would bring little, yet everything was for mutual enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This was called a love feast Jude 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Corinthians, however, did not properly take care of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They did not wait for one another 1 Cor 11:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the contrary, because each ate his own food, the rich became drunk while the poor starved v. 21 . This led to division and parties among them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For this reason, Paul rebuked them for despising the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the same way, if some saints are not able to dress properly, the rich ones should offer money to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am not speaking this lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>My point is that we cannot despise the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot sell the Lord s recovery cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord Jesus was not a wanton person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At the cross the soldiers cast lots for His garment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This proves that the Lord s garment was quite dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If He had dressed like a pauper, the soldiers would have thrown His garment away; they would not have fought over it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since we changed the system in October of 1984, there was a great turn within me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I did not want to initiate this change in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In 1949 the Lord sent me to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Just as I began from Taiwan and brought in the present situation, in the same way I want to begin from Taiwan and spread outward from here, gradually bringing in a new situation everywhere.</S>
