   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are four steps in the practice of the new way: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and building up.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every proper believer should always have two or three new believers under his care year-round.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two or three new believers would come from your visiting people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To "knock on doors" means that you go to contact people or you get people to contact you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To make a telephone call for the gospel is to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To ask your cousin to give you the name, address, and telephone number of one of his friends or relatives is also an aspect of knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To contact people is to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through knocking on doors, you are able to gain some new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Gradually, as you take care of two or three of these believers, one will be raised up and brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you lose these two or three under your care, you should go out again to gain another group of two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If some of the saints practice this way year-round, I have the assurance that they will bring two remaining fruit into the church life every year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have also encouraged the elders to take the lead in caring for people, leaving the direct care of the business affairs of the churches to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To not bear fruit for four or five years is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be "spiritual" and not bear fruit is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some elders have not borne fruit in ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some would take the excuse that they are busy with the business affairs of the church and do not have time to care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not the proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first thing in our Christian life should be begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the average, one new believer should be begotten of you, by you, through you, and with you every year.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not begetting new believers, we have to ask ourselves, "What kind of spirit are we of?" and "Do we think that we have the Spirit of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The new way, the God-ordained way, has been welcomed by most of the saints since 1988, but there are not many who really practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most saints consider that they are too busy and do not have enough time to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, I have encouraged the saints to budget their time, spending at least two or three hours a week for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not waste our time during the week with long and unnecessary telephone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Often when we have long telephone conversations, it is hard to avoid gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not have the intention of gossiping, but when our conversation continues for a long time, we may be tempted to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever you waste time, you have the wrong spirit and you do not have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Ephesians 5, redeeming the time v. 16 goes together with being filled in spirit v. 18 . Redeeming the time is closely related to having the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we need to learn to ask ourselves, "What kind of spirit are you of?" and "Do you think that you have the Spirit of God?"</S>
