<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE STEPS<br />
OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD<br />
IN SEEKING AND GAINING THE FALLEN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>My burden in this message is that we have to learn of the apostles, the elders, and even of the Triune God. We have to follow the steps of the processed Triune God in His seeking and gaining fallen people. Luke 15 records that the Pharisees and scribes criticized the Lord by saying, &ldquo;This man welcomes sinners and eats with them&rdquo; (v. 2). Then the Lord told three wonderful parables, which unveil the saving love of the Triune God toward sinners. (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> p. 39)</p>

<p>We often condemn others, exposing their failures and defects. We must admit that to speak well of ourselves and to expose others&rsquo; defects is our natural disposition. Our disposition is like this by birth. There is no need for us to speak about others&rsquo; defects, but we may simply like to do it. Many times the brothers come together and speak about others&rsquo; weak points, defects, and failures. I have learned the lesson to be fearful and trembling about speaking of others&rsquo; defects. In the world the legal term for this is <em>defamation.</em> Why do we need to speak in a defaming way? However, nearly all of us do this. Because by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace I have learned the lesson, it is very hard for you to hear me speak of anyone&rsquo;s defects. Whenever I speak of others&rsquo; shortages, I am condemned, saying to myself, &ldquo;Do you not have shortages?&rdquo; The Pharisees and scribes brought a sinful woman to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do You say?&rdquo; (John 8:5). First, the Lord stooped down. This was to show them humility. He did not stand, saying, &ldquo;What! Do you come to Me? Let Me tell you something!&rdquo; The Lord stooped down to write on the ground. According to my study of the Bible, I believe that what the Lord wrote was, &ldquo;Who is without sin?&rdquo; It is as if He said, &ldquo;There is no doubt that she is sinful, and she got caught. But are you without sin?&rdquo; They charged the Lord to say something, so He said, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (v. 7). Their conscience was caught. Everyone, beginning from the older ones, the experienced ones, was smitten. Who is without sin? When you speak of others&rsquo; shortages, do you not have shortages? Yet according to our disposition by birth, to speak about others&rsquo; defects is our &ldquo;hobby.&rdquo; Do you like to expose your own shortages? You do not; you like to cover them.

<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE LOVING AND FORGIVING HEART<br />
OF OUR FATHER GOD AND<br />
THE SHEPHERDING AND SEEKING SPIRIT<br />
OF OUR SAVIOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>I love Luke 15. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.&rdquo; The gentlemen and righteous men were not joined to Him, but the tax collectors and sinners were. Therefore, the Pharisees murmured and complained again. Then the Lord spoke three parables. The first is concerning a shepherd seeking the one, unique, lost sheep. Of one hundred, this one was a lost one, so the shepherd came purposely for him. Why did the Lord go to a house full of sinners and tax collectors? It was because among them there was one lost sheep of His, whom He had come to seek. The second parable is concerning a woman who lit a lamp and swept the house to seek her lost coin. The third parable is about the prodigal son. The shepherd is the Son, the woman is the Spirit, and in the parable of the prodigal son there is the Father. As the prodigal son was returning, he was preparing and considering what to speak to his father. He prepared himself to say, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). While he was walking and thinking like this, the father saw him. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.&rdquo; That the father saw the son a long way off was not an accident. From the time the son left home, the father must have gone out to look and wait for his coming back every day. We do not know how many days he watched and waited. When the father saw him, he ran to him. This is the Father&rsquo;s heart. The father interrupted the son while he was speaking his prepared word. The son wanted to speak the word he had prepared, but the father told his servants to bring the robe, the ring, and the sandals and to prepare the fattened calf. A teacher among the Brethren told me that in the whole Bible we can see God run only one time, in Luke 15, where the father sees the returning prodigal son. He ran; he could not wait. This is the Father&rsquo;s heart. </p>
<p>To speak truthfully, we have lost this spirit among the co-workers, elders, and vital groups. We do not have such a loving spirit that loves the world, the worst people. We classify people, choosing who are the good ones. Throughout my years I have seen many good ones. Eventually, very few of the good ones remain in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Rather, so many bad ones remain. In the beginning I also was one who classified them as bad, but today many bad ones are still here. If it were according to our concept, where would God&rsquo;s choosing be? Our choosing depends upon God, who chose His people before the foundation of the world. The Bible says that God hated Esau and loved Jacob. If we were there, none of us would have selected Jacob. This man was too bad. We would have selected Esau, the gentleman. From his mother&rsquo;s womb, Jacob was fighting, and when he was born, he grabbed his brother&rsquo;s heel. Eventually, he did everything that caused Esau to want to kill him. His mother Rebecca knew this, so she sent him away to his uncle&rsquo;s house, but when he went there, he did the same thing; he cheated his uncle by getting four wives from him. This is to live like a gangster. None of us would have chosen Jacob. It is not up to our choosing, our selection. It is based upon God&rsquo;s eternal selection.</p>
<p>If we lose this spirit, whether we are elders, co-workers, or serving ones, we are finished. This is the main reason why we are so barren, bearing no fruit for so many years. Recently, a brother went to care for a couple, but he did not have this spirit. He visited them no more than ten times and became disappointed. Since the couple had no heart for this brother, he reported that it was useless to visit them further. When Pastor Yu visited me, I did not care for him, but he continued to come for three or four months, week after week. We need to have this spirit. We all have to change our concept. Therefore, we need discipling. We have too much of the natural thought. We need to be discipled to have the divine concept, the concept of the Father&rsquo;s heart and the heart of the Lord Jesus, who came to save sinners.</p>
<p>Once we condemn anyone, we lose the position to take care of that one. Condemnation does not stir up our care for others. Who among the human race is loveable? In the eyes of God, everyone is not loveable in themselves, yet God still loves them; that is, He loves the world.

<p>As I have said before, the spirit of not shepherding and seeking others and being without love and forgiveness is spreading in the recovery everywhere. I believe that not having the Father&rsquo;s loving and forgiving heart and not having the Savior&rsquo;s shepherding and seeking spirit is the reason for our barrenness. I realize that you all work hard, but there is almost no fruit. The Lord says, &ldquo;By the fruit the tree is known&rdquo; (Matt. 12:33), but we are a tree without any fruit. Everywhere among us barrenness is very prevailing. A good, gentle pastor may not have a particular gift, such as the gift of speaking; he may simply visit people and welcome them when they come to his meeting, but according to statistics, he will have a ten-percent yearly increase. We, however, do not have even a ten-percent increase. Can you see how barren we are? Many of you are good speakers, knowing the higher truths. The truths we hold are much higher than those in Christianity. However, we do not have fruit because we are lacking in the Father&rsquo;s loving and forgiving heart and the Son&rsquo;s shepherding and seeking spirit. We condemn and regulate others rather than shepherd and seek them. We are short of love and shepherding. These are the vital factors for us to bear fruit, that is, to gain people. I am very concerned for our full-time training. Do we train the young ones to gain people or to regulate people? We have to reconsider our ways, as Haggai said (Hag. 1:5). Our way is not right; something is wrong. (<em>A Word of Love to the Co-workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord,</em> pp. 40-41)</p>
