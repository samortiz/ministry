<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FIGHTING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Num. 22:41&#151;23:26</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Balaam's Prophesying in Parables</H2><P>In the foregoing message we saw Balak's evil intention. In this message we will begin to consider Balaam's prophesying in parables (22:41&#151;24:25). The Hebrew word translated "parable" in 23:7, 18; 24:3, 15, 20, 21 may also be rendered "proverb." Here we prefer to use the word parable. Balaam's prophecies were not proverbs; they were parables.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Parable</H2><P>Balaam's first parable is in 22:41&#151;23:12.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Balak Bringing Balaam<br>Up to the High Places of Baal</H2><P>"In the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal; and from there he saw the extremities of the people" (22:41). In the Old Testament the high places were places where people worshipped idols. "Baal" was the name of an idol. Therefore, the high places of Baal were places where people worshipped the idol of Baal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Balaam Asking Balak<br>to Build for Him Seven Altars<br>and Provide for Him Seven Bulls and Seven Rams</H2><P>"Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and provide for me here seven bulls and seven rams. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken" (23:1-2a). Balaam's word indicates that the worship in which he was involved was a mixture. It is according to God's way to build an altar. However, here Balaam mixed the worship of God with the worship of Baal.</P><P>"Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram" (v. 2b). To whom did they offer&#151;to Jehovah or to Baal? Because of the mixture of the worship of God and the worship of Baal, it is difficult to determine to whom Balak and Balaam offered these offerings.</P><P>Such a mixture in worship can also be found in Catholicism. In the Catholic Church offerings are offered, but it is not clear to whom they are offered. Apparently, the offerings in the Catholic Church are offered to God; actually, these offerings are offered to different idols and images. Thus, the Catholic religion has mixed the worship of God with the worship of idols. In actuality, this worship is not even a mixture, for it is the worship of idols.</P>
