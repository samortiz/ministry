<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE SITUATION BETWEEN ISRAEL<br>AND THE PHILISTINES</H2><P>First Samuel 13:15b-23 tells us about the situation between Israel and the Philistines.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. On the Side of Israel</H2><P>On the side of Israel (vv. 15b-16a), Saul mustered the people who were with him, about 600 men. Saul, Jonathan, and the people dwelt in Geba of Benjamin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. On the Side of the Philistines</H2><P>On the side of the Philistines (vv. 16b-18, 23), raiders came out from the camp in three companies toward three directions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Israel Being Short of Swords and Spears</H2><P>Israel was short of sword and spears (vv. 19-22). There was no smith throughout all the land of Israel. At that time, Israel was under the strict control of the Philistines, who did not allow them to make swords or spears. On the day of battle, only Saul and Jonathan his son had a sword and a spear.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. ISRAEL'S CONQUEST OF THE PHILISTINES</H2><P>In 14:1-23 we have an account of Israel's conquest of the Philistines. Their situation was that they had no weapons. In such a poor situation, God was their unique weapon. Saul, Jonathan, and the people of Israel fought the battle by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Under Jonathan</H2><P>Verses 1 through 15 describe the conquest under Jonathan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jonathan Not Letting<br>His Father and the People Know<br>That He Was Going to Attack the Philistines</H2><P>Jonathan did not let his father and the people know that he was going to attack the Philistines (vv. 1-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Trusting in Jehovah for His Victory</H2><P>Jonathan trusted in Jehovah for his victory (vv. 6-10), believing that there was no constraint on Jehovah to save by many or by few. Jonathan was assured that Jehovah would deliver the Philistines into his hand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jehovah Delivering the Philistines<br>into the Hand of Israel</H2><P>Jehovah delivered the Philistines into the hand of Israel (vv. 11-15). Jonathan and his helper, a young man, killed the Philistines. There was panic among the Philistines in their camp, in their field, and among all the people. Even their garrison and their raiders were in a panic, and the earth quaked.</P>
