   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 19 says, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the second "do you not know."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first "do you not know" v. 15 refers to "the body is...for the Lord." The second "do you not know" refers to "the Lord is also for the body." In 1 Corinthians 3:16 the apostle already told us that "you are the temple of God." But now he specifically says, "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit." This means that the residence of the Holy Spirit expands from the spirit to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It would be wrong to assume that the Holy Spirit first settles in our body as His residence; the Holy Spirit initially dwells in our spirit and only communicates directly with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But there is nothing to restrict Him from issuing His life from the spirit and giving life to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we think that the Holy Spirit comes first to our body, we will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we limit the Holy Spirit only to our spirit, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We ought to know that our body has a place in God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ wants to sanctify our body and fill it with the Holy Spirit so that it can be a vessel for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because His body has passed through death, resurrection, and glorification, He can supply the Holy Spirit to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as our soul-life saturated our body, His Holy Spirit will saturate our body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wants to flow into every member and supply us with life and strength beyond what we can think.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is an established fact and something that we can experience in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many believers, like those in Corinth, seem to have forgotten this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the Holy Spirit is indwelling them, they appear as if He is not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need faith to believe, acknowledge, and receive God's facts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we claim them by faith, we will see the Holy Spirit not only put Christ's holiness, joy, righteousness, and love in our soul, but also put His life, power, health, and vigor into our weak, weary, and sick bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will bring to our body the life of Christ Himself and the element of His glorified body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When our body is willing to obey Him completely, when we are willing to reject all self-will and independent action, and when we seek nothing other than to be a temple for the Lord, in short, if we have really died in Christ, the Holy Spirit will surely manifest the life of the resurrected Christ in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How wonderful it would be if we saw that the Lord, through His Spirit dwelling in us, heals us, strengthens us, and becomes our health and life!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we believe that our own body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, we will follow the Spirit in awe and joy with much holiness and love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 6:20 says, "For you have been bought with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So then glorify God in your body."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last part of verse 19 is a continuation of the question in the same verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Do you not know...you are not your own?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You are not your own; you have been bought with a heavy price by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All that is yours, especially your body, belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is joined to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sealing of the Holy Spirit dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All this proves that your body belongs particularly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"So then glorify God in your body."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers, God wants us to glorify Him in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He wants us to glorify Him through a consecration in which "the body is...for the Lord," He wants us also to glorify Him through the grace in which "the Lord is for the body."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let us be sober and watchful, not allowing ourselves to employ our body for our own use, neither allowing our body to fall into a state as if the Lord is not for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then will we be able to glorify God, and only then will He be able to freely manifest His power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then, on the one hand, we will be freed from selfishness, self-love, and sin, and on the other hand, we will be freed from weakness, sickness, and pain.</S>
