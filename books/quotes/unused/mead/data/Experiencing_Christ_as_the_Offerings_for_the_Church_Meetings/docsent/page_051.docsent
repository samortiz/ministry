   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MUTUAL ABIDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter fifteen He went on to tell His disciples that they should abide in Him, and that He would abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They should make Him their home, and He would make them His home.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a mutual abiding, a mutual home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are His home, and He is your home.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You take Him as your home, and He takes you as His home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe we can all testify according to our daily experiences that we have the realization we are in the Lord, and the Lord is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many times I have had this kind of sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes when I was on an airplane I realized I was not just on the plane, I was in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While I was in Christ, He was in me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of sensation comes spontaneously after you offer Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spontaneously you would sense that you are in Him, and He is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, you realize that Christ is not only your sin offering and your trespass offering, but also your abiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He becomes your abode.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you realize that He is your abode, you also realize that you are His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a kind of mutual abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in chapter sixteen the Lord Jesus went on to say, All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you v. 15 . This means that whatever the Father has is embodied in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever the Son is, is realized through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And whatever the Spirit is, is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the Son is the embodiment of the Father, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, and we are the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is in us and we are His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ENTERING BY WAY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter fourteen tells us that there are many abodes and one Father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That means you and I can enter in and abide there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter fourteen He also told us that He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this way is a life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why He is the way, and He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Lord Jesus is not your life, you don t have a way to enter into God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way for you to enter into God the Father is the Lord Jesus as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you have the life, you have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But we can illustrate by the food you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the food and the nourishment you eat does not enter into you as lifeless matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you eat a small rock, it simply passes through you without giving any nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nourishment is something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is something that can enter into your cells and even into your fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once you take food in, it is digested and assimilated into your blood and into your cells and even into your fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, what has been assimilated by you becomes you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you eat a lot of fish, you become a composition of fish, or a constitution of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is how we can say that the Triune God becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You are what you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So in chapter fourteen you have the abode, and you have the way to enter in. The abode is the Triune God, and the way to enter in is life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you don t have Christ as the life, you could never enter into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when you take Christ as your life, this life becomes the way for you to enter into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So the Father becomes your abode, and eventually in chapter fifteen there is the mutual abiding with the mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE INCENSE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After these three chapters we come to chapter seventeen where the Lord Jesus prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we get into His prayer, I must point out that chapter seventeen is the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen are the actual tabernacle which 1:14 mentions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But where is this tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The laver is in chapter thirteen and following this are three chapters which are a full description and a full portrait of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we are in the Triune God, which means we are in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have passed by the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we have arrived at our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our destination within the tabernacle is the incense altar.</S>
