   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX A TIMELY WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE PRESENT NEED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26; Eph 4:11-16</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning the vision of the Lord s move today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As I mentioned in the previous chapter, a burden came to me in October of 1984 concerning the situation in the Lord s recovery at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was burdened to go to Taiwan to study our way of meeting and service, and to experiment with a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At first I was not clear what the Lord would lead us into, but I was burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to my observation, the recovery had fallen into a situation of oldness and had become stale.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I spent time to research the statistics concerning Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through those statistics I came to the conclusion that all of Christianity, including Catholicism, the Protestant denominations, and the free groups, had come to a standstill in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the last century and the first part of this century, many good expositions of the holy Word, messages on life, and messages on the principles of the Lord s death and resurrection were published.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, since the end of World War II, very few books of spiritual value have been published in Europe and America.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although a number of word studies and dictionaries have been published, there have been hardly any books with a definite revelation of the divine truths and a rich supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Andrew Murray, Jesse Penn-Lewis, and T. Austin-Sparks may be considered to be the last three writers in the line of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After their writings, almost nothing new has come out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With regard to gospel preaching for the increase, the situation in Christianity in the United States has also been going down.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I came to this country in the early 1960s and have watched the situation in Christianity for over a quarter of a century.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Recently a number of large denominations came together to study how to cover the entire earth with the gospel of Christ by the year 2000.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The conclusion they arrived at was that they are short of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, they are not short of persons because there are millions among them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One denomination alone numbers eleven million in the United States and three million abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the practice of the clergy-laity system has annulled so many of them, they say that they are short of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many of the major denominations have been decreasing in number for the past fifteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the matter of increase, Christianity has come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By 1984 there were at least seven to eight hundred local churches in the Lord s recovery around the earth on six continents, but we also had nearly come to a standstill in our increase.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That caused me to be burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though I was occupied with the revision of the Recovery Version of the New Testament, I never forgot this burden for a single day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been seeking a new way for a new start for the Lord s interest on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I reconsidered the teaching of the Bible, especially of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I reconsidered church history and the different practices of Christians in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I also paid much attention to the present situation of all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOSPEL PREACHING AS THE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In October of 1984, I did not fully know how the Lord would lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, I had the full assurance that the new way must begin strongly with gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gospel has to be spread, preached, and announced, not by inviting people to come to us, but by going to them where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I knew that this way for the gospel was biblical, and I knew that we must experiment with it at any cost to our resources.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before any new thing is developed, it must be tested many times, and the Full-time Training in Taipei was the laboratory for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During this time of experimenting, I suffered more criticism than ever in my over fifty years of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, I did not care about the criticism because I had the assurance in what I was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was assured that not only we in the Lord s recovery but also all of Christianity needed a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without a new start, there could be no way for the Lord to complete the building up of His Body as a preparation for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no use in maintaining something old and unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything must be up-to-date and scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Something that is out-of-date and unscriptural will not only decline but will come to an end. We must learn what the Lord s will is for the present time and how He desires to go on.</S>
