You are the life-giving Spirit, the consummated Spirit, the Spirit who is with us and who is now right among us!
In the Bible there is a genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1, which speaks of Christ as the son of Abraham and the son of David
Jesus' divinity is the Spirit of holiness, having the divine power and the divine element to transform Jesus' humanity, making it divine
In that big resurrection, which is the processed and consummated Triune God, the human part of Christ was made divine to be sonized
In His resurrection, all these human believers were made divine through the regeneration to be the many sons of God
Jesus Christ became the firstborn Son of God in resurrection, with His God-created humanity uplifted, having both divinity and humanity
The regenerated believers, having both humanity and divinity, are to be conformed to the image of this firstborn Son of God
In His humanity He is a human being, but this human being is not that pleasant to us because in His humanity He belonged to the old creation
His being in the likeness of the flesh of sin is typified by the bronze serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness
That serpent, as a type of Christ, uplifted by Moses in the wilderness was only in the likeness of a serpent, not in its nature
God became such a person for the purpose of terminating all these things, to get rid of them for our redemption
Suddenly, God inserted time into eternity, and time divides eternity into two parts-eternity in the past and eternity in the future
To God's understanding this was something planned by Him in His economy before the foundation of the world, in eternity past
We do not know how long He remained in eternity, but we do know that about two thousand years ago, He came out of eternity into time
He consummated His all-inclusive death, and He carried out the life-imparting and new-creation-germinating resurrection
He did a work to accomplish His all-inclusive death to deal with all the negative things in the whole universe
His death was the termination of everything negative, and His resurrection was the release of the divine life from the shell
Christ was born, designated, sonized, in the power of His divinity to be the firstborn Son of God in resurrection
To be in the heavenlies is to be in the atmosphere of the heavens, the realm of the heavens, and with the heavens' flavor, taste
We are in the United States, in the state of California, in the county of Orange, and in the city of Anaheim on Ball Road
We do not realize exactly how Christ prays for us, but all the real seeking Christians are always groaning-'O, Lord
Throughout the past twenty centuries, Jewish scholars and Christian teachers have studied and argued about who died on the cross
The flesh had been poisoned by Satan, corrupted with sin, Satan's nature, and usurped by the world, Satan's cosmos
When He died on the cross, all six items-the old creation, the old man, the flesh, Satan, sin, and the world-were crucified on the cross
Many actually came to the United States a few centuries ago when their forefathers came, because they came in them
The One who died on the cross also judged the world, the satanic cosmos, the evil system, which systematizes all the descendants of Adam
Also, Christ's flesh, His humanity, was the incarnation of God, so when this humanity was dying on the cross, God was also there
Colossians 2 tells us that when Christ was dying on the cross with God, Satan sent his evil angels to frustrate Him
They did not see that Satan had sent his evil angels to disturb Christ in His death and that God was stripping them off
As the only begotten Son of God, He is merely divine and is self-existing and ever-existing, eternal, without beginning or ending
His being the firstborn Son of God involves much more because the firstborn Son of God is a composition of His divinity plus His humanity
His divinity is exactly the same as the divinity of the only begotten Son of God, but His humanity was added by His being incarnated
From His incarnation to His death He still was the only begotten Son and this only begotten Son is the divine part of Christ as the Godman
In these many years, through a deep study of the Bible, the Lord has shown us the crystallization of this word designate
In His resurrection, all His believers were born, regenerated, with Him as His millions of 'twins' to make all these twins the same as He is
These millions of God-men are the mass reproduction who are exactly the same as the wonderful person Jesus Christ
In His resurrection He put the uplifted humanity into His divinity, and this One in resurrection became the life-giving Spirit
By this we can see that the person of Christ involves the entire New Testament from the first page of Matthew to the last page of Revelation
The first page of Matthew speaks of the genealogy of Christ , and the last page of Revelation speaks of the Spirit and the bride
Whoever believes, whether he is a Jew, a Gentile, a gentleman, or a bank robber, will be saved by this dynamic salvation
Even such a one as this Samaritan woman was saved by the powerful gospel in drinking the living water of Christ
In Luke 19 there is another story of the Lord's contact with a great sinner, Zaccheus, who was an evil chief tax collector
God also redeemed us from His righteous judgment, wrath, and condemnation and from eternal perdition in the lake of fire
We were also redeemed by the blood of Christ through the reconciliation of the believing sinners to God from their enmity toward God
We were redeemed through the justification of the believing sinners by God and the making of peace between the believing sinners and God
Through Christ's redemption, we have been forgiven, washed, reconciled, and justified, so peace has been made between God and us
Such a redemption lays the foundation of God's dynamic salvation for the consummation of God's dynamic salvation
We sinners need judicial redemption by the blood of Christ and also the organic salvation by the life of Christ
Not only are we sinful in the sins in our conduct, but also we are constituted to be sinners in the sin that is in our nature
In a wedding meeting a pastor may ask the husband to promise before God that he will love his wife for his whole life
On the one hand, it is a blessing to have children, but on the other hand, the more children you have, the more troubles you have
It is wonderful to have nothing, be nothing, see nothing, and care for nothing but Christ's interest here on earth
Also, because of Satan's rebellion and man's fall, the entire universe has become a vanity under the slavery of corruption
In God's salvation, we need to be sanctified, not by the blood of Christ, but by the indwelling Spirit of life
Now that we have seen the center and the content of God's gospel, we want to see the structure of the gospel of God
In eternity past, no doubt, there was a time when in God's heart, in God's love, He considered how to exercise His salvation
The source of God's salvation is love, but this salvation should be substantial, with some substance, and this substance is the element
The righteousness of God is related to God's laws, regulations, and principles; hence, it is a judicial matter
Recently, a brother among us visited a scholar and theologian who said that his view of salvation is more organic than judicial
Righteousness is revealed in the gospel of God as its foundation, solid and steadfast as the foundation of God's throne
God justifying us, on the one hand, is according to His righteousness, and on the other hand, is by His free grace
The book of Romans stresses further that God's grace is given freely to the New Testament believers unto life in reigning as kings like God
After the first four chapters, in chapter five, Paul's tone changes, going forth from God's righteousness to God's grace
Without God's righteousness, even if God is willing to give Himself to us as grace, He cannot do it because that is illegal, unlawful
The first stanza of Hymns, 295 says, 'God's Christ, who is my righteousness, / My beauty is, my glorious dress'
Right away God gave Christ to us as a glorious dress to cover us, so we are acceptable to God righteously, outwardly
Also, when Christ was given to us to be put on us, He entered into us to be our life and life supply to live Himself out of us
In Luke 15 when the prodigal son came back to the father, the father told his slaves to bring out the best robe and put it on his son
Immediately following this, the father said, 'And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry'
These two aspects of Christ as righteousness are also typified by the two garments of the queen in Psalm 45:13-14
We were crucified with Christ, buried with Christ, and raised up with Christ to simply walk in newness of life
The first one is the righteousness of God; the second, the life of Christ; and the third, the faith of the believers
The righteousness of God is judicial, the life of Christ is organic, and the faith of the believers is practical
If the righteousness of God plus the life of Christ were without the faith of the believers, nothing would happen
The righteousness of God and the life of Christ to us need not our own faith, but the faith of the believers to make them practical
We need to be those who receive the abundance of two things: the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness
Also, Romans 3:24 says that we are justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus
We believers have received two things in abundance: the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness
Objective righteousness is Christ given to us, grace is Christ enjoyed by us, and subjective righteousness is Christ lived out of us
If we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, will we be edified, taught, or perfected?
After that we need something organic in God's dynamic salvation, and this organic thing is the saving in the life of Christ
Verse 17 says that those who receive the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness will reign in life
If we walk in newness of life, the Spirit of life as a law will release us, set us free, from the law, the bondage, of sin and death
Such a life will then be continually given to us by being dispensed into all the parts of our being through the indwelling Spirit
The first is the section of foundation by the redemption of Christ judicially as the initiation of God's salvation
The indwelling Christ moves in the believers by the Spirit of life that they may enjoy Christ's life with its peace
Such a life glorifies us through the redemption of our body that we may enter into the freedom of glory and our full sonship
Isaiah 40:31 says, 'Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew their strength; / They will mount up with wings like eagles'
For many years the Lord has not prepared the environment with the proper people for this kind of gathering until today
If you have the opportunity, it would be very good to preach the gospel according to this crystallization of Romans
Tell people about Christ in His divinity and humanity, in His being the only begotten Son of God and the firstborn Son of God
Try in your vital group to go out to touch people by presenting Christ in the way that you have heard in these messages
When the proper preaching of the gospel is going on, the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, accompanies that preaching
That preaching speaks Christ outside of you, but the pneumatic Christ right away accompanies that preaching and works within you
The end of Romans 9 tells us that the lawkeepers are trying to build up their own righteousness by their work to keep the law
The beginning of chapter ten says, 'For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes'
Eventually, all three, the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers, become the all-inclusive Christ
Peter 4:16 uses the title Christian, saying, 'But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name'
The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
One who worshipped the emperor the Caesar or Kaisar was called Kaisarianos which means an adherent of Kaisar a person who belongs to Kaisar
When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their Kaisar
At Antioch they began to call the followers of Christ Christianoi , adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach
At the end of the chapter, the Jews said to Him, 'You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham'?
If a husband realized that only God is and he is not, then he would not love his wife by himself and in himself
Sisters, when you go shopping, if you realized that in the whole universe only God is, would you buy anything you want?
Why did John write the book of Revelation and declare, 'Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming' ?
We trust in this cleansing that we might be kept in the fellowship with You, dear Lord-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
We may have a car, a house, and other material possessions, but we are not for these things, because we care only for things not seen
We know by faith that these things are coming, because faith is the conviction of things not seen and the substance of things hoped for
When we hear that the Lord Jesus will come again and that we will be raptured and glorified, there is a question mark within us
When the serpent tempted Eve, probably he lifted up his head and was himself in the shape of a question mark as he asked, 'Has God said
When people read the promises in the Bible, the snake, the question mark, is within them to cause them to doubt God
When the word of the Bible is spoken to us and heard by us, right away the written word becomes the living word
Faith comes from the hearing of this applied word by the Spirit through the living Christ out of the written Bible
When you call on Him and pray-read the word, right away you have the deep sensation that Christ is living within you
God's written word in the Bible becomes Christ as the living word, who is applied into us as the Spirit, the word of the Spirit
We are related to God through these three aspects of His word: the written word, the living word, and the applied word
We believe in the word, and the word has three stages: the written word, the living word, and the applied word
Over two thousand years ago, there was only the written word, not the living word, because Christ was not here yet
Today we have the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit indwelling us all the time
In just thirty-three and a half years, from Christ's incarnation to His resurrection, great things were accomplished in the universe
Whatever took place in these thirty-three and a half years as great things has been written in the New Testament
Out of this consummation of the Triune God, the church came into being, and the church as the house of God is the Body of Christ
The New Jerusalem will remain in the new heaven and new earth as a city expressing God for eternity in divinity mingled with humanity
Lord, here we can see something marvelous, something excellent, something that will surprise us to the uttermost
He is satisfied and joyful because His righteousness has judicially fulfilled all the legal requirements of the divine law
It was as if Paul were saying I live Christ not by my faith but by the faith of Jesus the Son of God that is not my faith but His faith
When you call on Him in this way, He becomes the faith imparted into you so that you spontaneously live Him by this faith
He Himself as the faith becomes your faith, and this is the linking organ that links you to the unlimited, infinite Christ
The infusing of Christ in you causes you to have Him in you as your faith, which is the linking organ that links you with Him
From 1951 to 1961, this brother passed on a large sum of money each year to cover all the needs of the work in Taiwan
Some of the young people may be burdened to serve the Lord full-time, but they may wonder how they can be supported
Also, within a short time, millions of dollars of offerings came in from different churches for the support of the Lord's move to Russia
If you are going to follow the Lord, you have to walk by faith, not being threatened by any kind of opposition
When some of the young people came to the full-time training, they may have had their own thought about how wonderful the training was
When Paul wrote 2 Timothy, he told his young co-worker, Timothy, that all the churches in Asia had abandoned his ministry
In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul charged Timothy to pursue after righteousness first, with the ones who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
Genesis 15:6 says concerning Abraham, 'And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness'
In this message we want to see six more crucial points related to the crystallization of the faith of the believers
In the first section of our crystallization-study on faith, we saw that faith comes from the hearing of the word
When we were sinners, one day under God's sovereignty we heard the preaching of the gospel, that is, the word of Christ
Romans 1:17 is Paul's quotation of Habakkuk 2:4, which is also referred to by Paul in Galatians 3:11 and Hebrews 10:38
The electricity in a building links the building with the power plant, even though the power plant may be a hundred miles away
If you do not pray for two days, you feel you are not only cut off from God but also cut off from all the saints
In the Old Testament, when the children of Israel entered into the good land, Joshua allotted the good land under God's leading
We can have the linking faith not just by hearing the word but by contacting the very Triune God who is faith to us
Because God became a man and died on the cross to be our Savior judicially, He can allot Himself into our being as the linking faith
To think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think without a sober mind is to annul the proper order of the Body life
If you are not sober-minded, God would not increase His apportioning of faith to you, and He probably would even decrease it
Ephesians 2:8 says, 'By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God'
In Romans 1:12 Paul said, 'I with you may be encouraged among you through the faith which is in one another, both yours and mine'
Christianity has made itself in every way and in every thing a religion without the real contact with the Lord
If we only see this high peak and do not touch the very God, the Triune, as the consummated Spirit, we are in doctrine
Day and night, every day, we have to contact the consummated Triune God as the compound, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit
The religious people like to maintain their formality with everything in good order, but everyone who meets God becomes 'crazy'
When the Lord Jesus entered into Jerusalem for the last time the people became crazy in their praising saying Hosanna to the Son of David!
In this message we would like to fellowship three more points in our crystallization-study of the essence of the faith of the believers
Just about two days ago, the Triune God suddenly came into the womb of a virgin, and eventually God was born of her to be a man
He also passed through an all-inclusive death and an all-surpassing resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
These verses tell us that those who receive the abundance of grace will reign in life and that grace can reign
We may say that we enjoy Christ and enjoy the Divine Trinity, but what kind of indication can people see in us of this enjoyment?
Their work of faith became such a strong factor in their lives that people everywhere were talking about their faith
Their faith became such an indicator of their life in the enjoyment of Christ that they became a pattern to all the believing ones
The person may say that he is a Christian from a Christian family but that he is not like a Christian because he does not have faith
Strictly speaking, with us, the believing ones, faith is not for us to accomplish careers, to accomplish a big work
If it took a doctors degree to serve the Lord in His ministry of life then Peter Paul and even Jesus Himself would have been disqualified
Eventually, within one winter, they turned more than forty Swedish China Inland Mission churches to the recovery
When people contact you, they should see that there is a strong factor indicating that you are linked with God
You have to learn of someone how to live God, how to live Christ, how to magnify Christ, and how to minister Christ to others
Wherever we go and wherever we are, we should bear an indication that we are nothing, but God in Christ is everything to us
Where is faith today among not only the Gentiles the pagans but also among the Jews the Catholics the Protestants and the Pentecostal people
Eventually, the Lord will find some, a small number of overcomers, who are living by the linking faith when He returns
Those who live by faith today will eventually receive the end of their faith, that is, the salvation of their souls
If we live by the linking faith in the progressing stage to be transformed, we will be kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom
To make ourselves ready is to become an overcomer, who is always linked by the living faith with the Triune God
The overcomers will be rewarded by Christ with the co-kingship and the top enjoyment of the divine life with Him in the millennium
We were loving the world, which lies wholly in the evil one and of which Satan, the evil one, the enemy of God, is the ruler
Whatever you love outside of and apart from Christ-whether good or bad, high or low, moral or immoral- belongs to the world
We are regenerated in Christ in resurrection ; in this rebirth the divine transfer takes place and transfers us out of Adam into Christ
We were chosen by God the Father to be holy to partake of His holy nature and predestinated unto sonship to possess His divine life
We are organically regenerated to be the many sons of God the many brothers of Christ for the constitution of the church the Body of Christ
We have received the divine nature, but the divine nature has to work within us by the Spirit of life to sanctify us into God's holiness
God's divine nature is the element of sanctification, and this element is wrought into our being by the Spirit
Nothing in the entire Bible is so important, yet this wonderful Spirit has nearly been put aside by today's Christians
Afterward, the first Epistle is Romans and the last one is Revelation, with the epistles to the seven churches
The Spirit of God as the Holy Spirit was there to accomplish the wonderful incarnation through which God became man
When we come to John 7, during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified
Many have been bound, frustrated, limited, covered, and blinded by their kind of traditional, fundamental teaching
In the last part of the Bible, the Spirit is unveiled as the Spirit of life who has both divinity and humanity
After Christ's resurrection, when Christ had uplifted His humanity into His divinity, the Spirit became something more
The Bible says that the Spirit of Jesus Christ has a bountiful supply because He is the Spirit of both God and of the man Jesus
We would like to quote from chapter five, concerning the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, of his masterpiece entitled The Spirit of Christ
The Son, who had from eternity been with the Father, entered upon a new stage of existence when He became flesh
To bring human nature itself again into the fellowship of the Divine life, to make us partakers of the Divine nature
The Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man-most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man
He can now come down to witness of the perfect union of the Divine and the human, and in becoming our life, to make us partakers of it
The Holy Spirit descends as a Person to dwell in believers, and to make the glorified Jesus a Present Reality within them
The one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God and the four spices signify man as the head of the creatures
Within Him are these six things-God and man, Christ's death and its effectiveness, and Christ's resurrection and its power
The Spirit of life is a particular, extraordinary title given to the Spirit of God in the New Testament economy
Regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation are the five major steps of God's dynamic salvation
Such an all-inclusive Spirit, as the Spirit of life, becomes the seven Spirits of God in the dark age of the church in its degradation
Paul said that although he could not find anything wrong with himself, he could not justify himself until the Lord comes
We have to realize that we always need the blood of Christ and that it is by the sevenfold intensified Spirit that we become overcomers
The Nicene Creed does not mention John 7:39, which says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified
The Nicene Creed does not point out that 'the Lord is the Spirit,' the transforming Spirit, as mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17-18
Now we can see that in the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, the Spirit of God is unveiled in stage after stage
The first mention of the Spirit of God is in Genesis 1:2, which says that the Spirit was brooding over the dark waters
In the New Testament, there are the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The title the Spirit is mentioned the first time in John 739 which says The Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified
Concerning the Spirit of God as revealed in the holy Scripture, 'the Spirit of God' is at the beginning, and 'the Spirit' is at the end
He is also the reality of Christ, the application of the pneumatized Christ, and the very pneumatic Christ in our experience of Christ
God, man, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, and the sevenfold intensified Spirit are one thing
God's economy is to gain man and make man the same as He is for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ
What God wants, what God desires, is only the organic Body of Christ in which God has constituted Himself with humanity
Whoever reads 1 Timothy 1:3-4 should ask what the economy of God is, because this is the top thing concerning which Paul exhorted Timothy
We need to realize that Satan hates the high peak of the divine revelation concerning the ultimate goal of God's economy
Zechariah 12:1 and Isaiah 42:5 indicate that the spirit of man should be ranked with the heavens and the earth
For God's fulfillment of His eternal economy, three things are the greatest: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man
Man was created with a spirit, not made but produced of the breath of the life of God breathed into the nostrils of man
The spirit of man is the innermost part of man as the reality of man, highly ranked with the heavens and the earth in God's creation
Man's spirit is the inner organ of man for him to contact God, to receive God, and to contain God for God's expression in man
The spirit of man is not only for contacting and receiving God but also for containing God that God may be expressed through man
The spirit of man is the lamp of God to contact, receive, and contain God as the light for God to shine through man
The soul was meant to be under man's spirit as its subordinate to carry out the desires and purposes of the spirit of man
According to the order of God's creation, the spirit is the 'boss,' whereas the soul is the body's direct 'boss'
After we were regenerated, it became sweet to cry, 'Abba, Father,' because our spirit has become a spirit of sonship
In 3:5 he said that the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church was revealed to the apostles and prophets in their spirit
We have the Spirit of God as the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, but not in our mind, so we must set our mind on the spirit
The Spirit of God within our spirit will come to fill up our mind, and we will enjoy the indwelling Christ as our life and our peace
The first four books of the New Testament, the four Gospels, are on Christ the all-inclusive One, who was God becoming a man, the God-man
The church begins in Acts and then occupies twenty-one books of the New Testament, twenty-one Epistles, from Romans to Jude
The last great person in the New Testament is the New Jerusalem, which is seen in the last book of the Bible, Revelation
The four verses in Revelation that show that John was in spirit to see these visions are 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; and 21:10
The divine Spirit needs the human spirit to match Him, to be His counterpart, that they could be mingled together as one entity
The fallen man pays attention mainly to his soul plus his body to take care of his physical and psychological needs
Regretfully, very few Christians know that they have a spirit, so for them there is no need to have any discernment
Our person today is the spirit, and this person has two organs, the soul as the inward organ and the body as the outward organ
The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 16:24-25, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
God's living word pierces to the dividing of the believers' soul and spirit, as their joints and marrow are divided
They should pray-read the Word of God until it pierces into their spirit that they may be able to discern their spirit from their soul
When we go shopping, we may see many things that we would like to buy, but we do not buy them, because we do not have the money
If a young brother is choosing a university to go to for his further education, he should choose it by exercising his spirit
Since the day you were transferred from the old creation to the new creation through regeneration, your spirit became your person
We want to see the most marvelous excellent mysterious and allinclusive transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a man
He lived a human life, yet He lived not by His human life but by His divine life to express the divine attributes in His human virtues
It is difficult to imagine that one day God in His incarnation became a serpent, as typified by the bronze serpent
The old man is the representative, the center, of the old creation, so by destroying the old man He terminated the old creation
All the different tribes, races, and peoples have their different customs and ways of living and worshipping God
The Chinese have their way of eating with chopsticks, and the Indonesians have their way of eating with their fingers
The transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a man are for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy
The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh-which He received through His incarnation -not in His Spirit as His divinity
Lord, in these days while we are seeking You, grant us to experience You every day as the reality of all the revelations You have shown us
The first marvelous and excellent thing which transpired in Christ's resurrection was the designation of His humanity
In His incarnation He brought divinity into humanity, and in His resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity
In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus Himself said, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
God made Him sin to die for us sinners in the form, the likeness, of the serpent, without the poison of the serpent
By that one death, that one crucifixion on the cross, four things were cleared up: the flesh , sin, Satan, and the world
To say that God is the Holy Spirit is right, but John 4:24 does not refer to the Holy Spirit of the Divine Trinity
He came to be a man in His divinity, and that divinity is the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 1:4 and John 4:24
Peter 3:18 says that when Christ was being put to death on the cross, His flesh was being put to death, not His Spirit
In the same principle, while Christ was on this earth before His resurrection, a part of Him, His humanity, was not divine
In Christ's resurrection, His divinity as the Spirit was made strong to impart Himself into His humanity to make it divine
The Son of God in resurrection is both divine and human, so this Son of God is not the Only Begotten but the Firstborn among many brothers
We may say that Christ in His humanity was the first one regenerated, so He became our firstborn Brother, and we became His many brothers
The phrase inpower corresponds with 1 Peter 3:18, which says that Christ's flesh was put to death, but His Spirit was made alive
On the cross Christ was made alive by God to accomplish God's purpose and even to proclaim God's victory over Satan
Peter 318 shows that in Christs resurrection His divine part was made alive to impart divinity into His humanity making His humanity divine
Christ's humanity was designated into His divinity out of resurrection, which is the Triune God embodied in Christ
He was born of God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among His many brothers, the many sons of God
Peter 1:3 and Ephesians 2:6 reveal that Christ's redeemed believers were regenerated with Him in the same resurrection
In Matthew 26:64 the high priest asked the Lord Jesus if He was the Son of God, but He answered with 'the Son of Man'
They would agree that Christ is both God and man, but they might feel that Christ was no longer a man after His resurrection and ascension
Unconsciously, they may think that Christ was a man only for the thirty-three and a half years from His incarnation to His resurrection
Joseph from Arimathea took the body of Jesus and he and Nicodemus bound it in linen cloths and laid it in a new tomb
Christ's body was gone because His body had been resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity
His body was resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity, and that transformation was God's begetting
There is a hymn which says, 'Count your blessings, name them one by one; / Count your blessings, see what God hath done'
John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, not full of blessing, but full of grace and reality
According to the entire Bible, God does not want us to do anything for our salvation, to do something to please Him
The principle of the Sabbath is for us to stop ourselves, not do anything, and let God be everything to us and do everything for us
In His old creation, God created man in His image, but this man did not have God's life, nature, or intrinsic constitution
He passed through human living, an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems and redeem us, and an all-conquering resurrection
Through this thirtythreeandahalfyear process and consummation He is now compounded with human nature human living death and resurrection
On the one hand He is God on the other hand He is man with the experiences of human life a wonderful death and an allconquering resurrection
The source of grace, the element of grace, and the application of grace are of the three Persons of the Divine Trinity to be our everything
In this dispensing of God, the grace is called the grace of God , the grace of Christ , and the grace of which the Spirit is
In the New Testament, phrases such as the grace of God, the love of God, or the light of God may be considered as appositional
Grace is the Triune God by the Father as the source, by the Son as the element, and by the Spirit as the application
