<h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM WENCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</h2><p>To my dear brother in the Lord, Yueh Chiao:</p><p>I received your letter on the evening of the eleventh and learned of your charge to me to preach the gospel to Mr. Chin Tao Pen. That evening I gave the brothers and sisters the responsibility to pray and ask the Lord concerning His leading. After the prayer meeting on the nineteenth, the brothers decided to go to preach the gospel to him that evening. Thank the Lord, before we got up to leave, he came into our meeting place. He said that he had received a letter from Sister Chin (Mr. Chin's aunt) at 6:00 p.m. that evening, asking him to come. He left his house at 6:20 p.m. and did not find the place until 8:00 p.m. A few brothers and I preached the gospel to him. Thank and praise the Lord, His Spirit began to work in him immediately. He confessed his sins and received the Lord. He came to the Lord's Day afternoon meeting the next day and to the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening meetings. Last Lord's Day afternoon he also came to hear the gospel. After the meeting, two brothers and I went to his place to talk to him. He declared that he was saved by grace. We see that he has really gained life. He has honestly repented and believed. He said that in August and September of last year, he went out every night to gamble, drink, and do all sorts of evil things. He even spent the entire night out. Although he went to the denominational chapels to listen to the messages last year he did not feel that they were interesting; therefore, he stopped going. Now that he has heard the gospel, he spends every evening in his room reading the Bible and praying, except when he comes to the meetings. He is very joyful. This is really a special blessing from the Father. Please thank the Lord with us and tell Sister Chin about this. I will not say anything more now. I will write later. May the Lord's Spirit be with you all!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />P'an Huo Ling</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM TSINGTAO, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</h2><p>Peace to my brother in the Lord, You Yen:</p><p>I received and read your letter. We go to Mr. Hsu Hsiao Feng's home every Lord's Day. Sister Hsu has become much better recently. We can say that the Lord's work has a beginning in Tsingtao. We have seen the Lord save some. Brother Ching Ch'ing and I are too weak. He is very busy, and he told me tonight that his stomach illness was acting up. I am too pressured. My brother's illness has already turned for the better. We really want the brothers to cry out to God in one accord for us! (Parts omitted.) May the Lord bless you with peace and goodness. Please greet Brother Lin and Brother Tu for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Tze Chieh<br />January 8, 1935</p><p>Can Brother Nee pass through Tsingtao on his way to Manchuria? We hope he can stay here for a night or two.</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM CHIA HSIN, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</h2><p>Peace to my brothers in the Lord, Brother Tu, Brother Lin, and Brother Wu:</p><p>I received your letter. You really were right. We began the Lord's table today. Six people came to the meeting, three brothers and three sisters. We believe the Lord's promise is eternally faithful. He will remember our weaknesses, care for our immaturity, increase our strength, give us wisdom, not leave us orphans, lead us, and keep us. We only have to believe and trust in the Lord and stand firm in this place. As long as we thank and praise Him for His victory, we will be in peace.</p><p>Please pray and ask the Lord for the following:</p><p>(1) That a door for the gospel would be opened so the number of those who testify for the kingdom would increase.</p><p>(2) That those who are already saved would have more heart to love the Lord.</p><p>(3) That gifted ones and responsible ones would be raised up.</p><p>(4) That He would keep those walking in the way.</p><p>(5) That everything of the enemy would be destroyed.</p><p>May you have peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Lo Yung Tien, Chang Yu Chih<br />January 27, evening</p>
