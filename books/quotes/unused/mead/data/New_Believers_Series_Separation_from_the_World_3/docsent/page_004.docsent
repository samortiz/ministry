   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Things Which the World Considers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Improper for Christians to Do</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should refrain from anything that the world considers improper for Christians to do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our Christian life at the minimum should meet the standard of the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone in the world has set up a yardstick and a standard for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you do not meet this standard, you have failed them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you do something, you should not give the Gentiles any ground to ask, "Do Christians do this?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If others say this, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as you are rebuked, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose you are caught visiting certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gentiles may say, "Do Christians come to places such as this?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many places Gentiles like to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you tell them that it is wrong to visit those places, they may insist and argue with you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if you visit those places yourself, they will ask, "How can you also go to these places?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some matters are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Gentiles do them, they keep quiet about it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if you do the same things, they will speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we must refrain from things that the Gentiles consider improper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a minimum requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a Gentile says, "Christians should not do such a thing," we should turn away from it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some young people are saved, but their parents are still unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes these children ask for something from the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The parents may say, "Do you Christians want these things as well?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is most shameful for a Christian to find himself adjusted by the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham lied and was rebuked by Abimelech.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a most shameful thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must refrain from things that are considered improper by the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must stay away from things that the worldly people, the Egyptians, consider inappropriate for Christians to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be separated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. Things Incompatible with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anything that is incompatible with the Lord must also be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since the Lord suffered humiliation on the earth, we should not seek glory here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the Lord was crucified like a robber, we should not seek to be welcomed everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When our Lord was walking on the earth, He was accused of demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot allow people to say that we have the best mind, that we are smart, or that we are very intellectual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to pass through what the Lord passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everything that is incompatible with the Lord must go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord said that a slave is not greater than his master and a disciple is not greater than his teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the world treated our Master one way, we should not expect it to treat us another way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it treated our Teacher one way, we should not expect it to treat us another way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are not treated the same as our Master, something is wrong with us, and something is definitely wrong in our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever our Lord experienced on the earth should be our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To follow Jesus of Nazareth, one must be ready to suffer humiliation; this is not a thing of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To follow Jesus of Nazareth means to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When others first came to the Lord, the Lord told them that they had to bear the cross in order to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Lord, this is the main entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not wait until a person is in the room before He tells him this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we go in, the Lord makes it clear that we must bear the cross in order to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has called us to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way we are taking, and we can only follow the Lord according to this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord's relationship with the world should be our relationship with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our relationship with the world must be compatible with our Lord's relationship with the world; we cannot take a different way.</S>
