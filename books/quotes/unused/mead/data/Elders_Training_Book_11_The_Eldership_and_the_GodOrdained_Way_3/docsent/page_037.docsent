   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The most crucial and key point in leading a sinner to be regenerated and saved is to lead him to exercise his spirit in prayer to contact the Lord Jesus as the Spirit that he may be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The one we contact may say that he does not know how to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can tell him that it is to speak a little louder in prayer and speak from the depths of his being, and we may also demonstrate the exercise of the spirit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It makes a great difference whether or not the ones we contact exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is true that whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved, but many have only called on the Lord shallowly and not from their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord is the Spirit, and we must worship Him and contact Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the principle established in John 4:24, and we must stress this point.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may help them by using the illustration of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot use a piece of wood to contact electricity; we must use metal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Touching electricity with metal is like contacting the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today Christ is our God, and He is the life-giving Spirit waiting for us to receive Him.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot hear a voice with our eyes or see colors with our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must use the right organ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should spend several minutes to stress this to the one we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we can ask him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He may have prayed many times without touching the Lord, but we must help him to pray again until we sense that he has touched the Lord and he senses that he has been touched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is very crucial, and this is the key point in leading a sinner to be regenerated and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without touching the Lord the Spirit by exercising one's spirit, no one can be properly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Electricity may be installed in a building, but we still need the proper connection in order to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Too often we try to install the "electricity" in people without leading them to make the proper "connection."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must help people to exercise their spirit, and we ourselves must learn how to be properly connected to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must realize that He is the Spirit, that we have a human spirit, and that we should exercise our spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we pray with someone, we should use some Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should present to him some golden verses concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When it is time to pray, it is better to teach the person how to pray-read and digest one of those verses, to assimilate it by exercising his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this he will contact the Lord, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is also crucial to lead a person to have the assurance of salvation Mark 16:16; 1 John 5:13 .</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should help the new ones to have two copies of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One should be a copy without any notes, to be used for morning watch.</S>
