First, He cares for Himself, His divine Person. Second, He cares for humanity. Man was made by Him in His own image for His expression. Third, God cares for His Christ, His Son Jesus Christ. Finally, God cares for the Body of Christ.<p>God will not tolerate anything that is a blasphemy or insult to Himself. God refuses any idolatry or anyone who worships idols. He never allows any man to have another God. God also cares so much for the man He made to express Himself. Anything that damages humanity such as fornication, extortion, or things like this, God will never allow. Then anything that insults the Person of Christ, or the redemptive work of Christ, including His incarnation, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His ascension, His Lordship, or His coming back, God will never tolerate. The Body of Christ, the church, is uniquely one; nothing should divide it or damage it. Anything that damages it, God will never allow. This is why the apostle said to admonish a person that is sectarian once, at the most twice, but if he would not listen, reject him (Titus 3:10). God is so strong regarding this point because to be sectarian damages the Body of Christ. God basically cares for these four things.<p>Some Christians, however, believe and teach that God cares so much for what they call the &#8220;great commission,&#8221; that is, to go preach the gospel and then baptize people by immersion. Others believe and teach that God cares so much for the speaking in tongues. Among these people some teach that if you do not speak in tongues, you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. However, God has reacted to these kinds of teachings. Many good saints have never been baptized by immersion. Also, thousands have been saved who never spoke in tongues. Even so many became spiritual giants. During the last half century, almost no one was as prevailing as Brother Watchman Nee, but he never spoke in tongues. A number of others who were used by the Lord such as Charles H. Spurgeon, D. L. Moody, R. A. Torrey, and George Mueller, the king of faith, did not speak in tongues.<p>However, this does not mean that tongue-speaking is wrong. Neither does it mean that immersion is wrong. I am for immersion. My point is that God does not care as much for the different teachings and practices as some Christians do.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING A BASIC LESSON</h2><p>We all must learn a basic lesson. If a person is an idol worshipper, he could never be used by God. Rather, God refuses anyone who worships an idol. God also refuses a fornicator. He could never use such a one. However, you cannot say that God will refuse someone who does not agree with immersion. You may be through with him, but God is not through with him.<p>Also, we cannot say God could use a Modernist, one who says that Christ is not the Son of God or says that Christ did not die on the cross for our sins, but only suffered martyrdom. Neither can God use one who is sectarian. God refuses such persons. But you cannot say that if one does not speak in tongues, God is through with him. You may be through with him, but God is not through with him.<p>God&#8217;s primary consideration is that as long as you love and worship Him as your unique God, as long as you love humanity and do nothing to damage it in any manner, such as fornication, extortion, etc., as long as you honor Christ, respect Him, receive Him, follow Him, love Him, and take Him as your Redeemer, as your life, as your Lord, and as your everything, and as long as you love the Body of Christ, the church, and live for it, you will be a person whom God will use very much.<p>All the other things are minor. If you like to wear a head covering, you can cover your head for the Lord&#8217;s sake. If you like foot-washing, you may practice it. If you like to take small pieces of leavened bread for the Lord&#8217;s table, you do it. If you like to take unleavened bread, prepare some. We should not oppose any teachings and practices like these. However, if I am asked to prepare the bread, I would prepare something unleavened. I do not insist on unleavened bread; yet, I practice it. If I were a sister, surely I would wear a head covering. According to my conscience, I would have to cover my head. I would practice these things in this manner; yet, I do not insist on any way. God&#8217;s basic consideration and caring is only for Himself, for humanity, for Christ, and for the Body of Christ, the church.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
