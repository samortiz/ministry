   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEARING OUT SAMSON'S CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Samson's failure was not as serious as the loss of his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He could not afford to lose his testimony of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once he lost his consecration, he lost his power; once he lost his testimony, he lost God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Samson was a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan knew that the source of Samson's power was in his consecration; therefore, he focused his efforts on this very crucial thing he tried to take away Samson's consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How did Satan do it?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He used Delilah, who pressed Samson daily with her words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, Samson's soul was vexed unto death, and he told her all that was in his heart, revealing the source of his power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result was that he fell into Satan's snare; he lost his consecration, his power, his testimony of sanctification, and God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This daily, pressing work is the work of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that Satan uses many methods to wear man out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He can wear us out physically, circumstantially, or spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does not attack fiercely; rather, he wears out slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we have to be aware of his wearing out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must not allow him to continue his wearing-out work; we must oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BEING DISGUSTED WITH SATAN'S WEARING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul was preaching in Macedonia, he met a girl possessed by a spirit, who followed him, crying out, "These men are slaves of the Most High God, who announce to you a way of salvation" Acts 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She cried out this way for many days, until Paul felt disgusted at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He turned to the spirit and said, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her" v. 18 . The spirit came out that very hour.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spiritually, we need such a feeling of disgust.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be disgusted not with men but with the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul was truly disgusted with the spirit; he was not disgusted with the girl.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Paul charged the spirit to come out of the girl, he was treating the girl as a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the devil tries to wear us out, we should have the same feeling of disgust as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you know that Satan is wearing you out, you have to pray for God to give you a feeling of disgust, that is, a feeling of disgust and anger with Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people can get angry at men, but they cannot get angry at the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If others offend them, they break out in a fit of anger, but when the devil wears them out, they do not feel a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul was worn out by Satan to the extent that he became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once he opened his mouth to rebuke the spirit, the spirit went away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we must not keep our mouth shut all the time; we have to declare something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It would be wonderful if God's children would become angry with Satan and rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If anyone becomes angry with Satan, we will say, "Hallelujah, this is wonderful!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some people are very weak; they allow Satan to wear them out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's children should become angry with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They need to be disgusted with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once they become angry and disgusted, everything will be set right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We often keep silent and endure while Satan is wearing us out; we try to suffer silently.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But at a certain point, we become disgusted and angry, saying, "I do not agree with this!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not want this!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This speaking and anger will deliver us and stop the wearing-out work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's children should stand up to reject Satan in disgust; they should rebuke Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people have never experienced deliverance or release because they still have the "strength" to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A man who endures Satan's wearing out and allows Satan to waste his energy, joy, and spirit has fallen into Satan's trap.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not saying that we should be angry with those men whom Satan has used; we must be patient with them and still love them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we should oppose and reject the strategies and methods of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we oppose Satan's work, we will be freed and liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The power to reject Satan comes from realizing his pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some believers have been deceived and attacked by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They withstand it and oppose it, yet they do not feel that they have any strength.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because they have not seen the pressure of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We often oppose and reject him, yet we do not have any energy to raise our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because we have not seen Satan's pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not we can reject Satan depends on whether we are disgusted with him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not sufficiently disgusted with him, our speaking to him will be like speaking to the air; it will not produce any effect.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But when we truly become disgusted and angry with him, the anger will become our strength, and the minute we open our mouth, he will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a feeling of disgust comes from revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once we see that Satan is wearing us out, we must oppose him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we see this, Satan cannot do anything more; he will realize his hopelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we see Satan's wearing-out work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as we tolerate and endure him, his work will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the minute we feel disgusted and become angry with him, Satan will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must realize that no other kind of withstanding will work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Satan will withdraw only when we withstand him with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not see this and allow him to go on, he will not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we see that Satan is doing the work and plotting everything, we must say, "I do not want this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I oppose this."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God will then bless our withstanding, and it will become effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Finally, let us read Ephesians 6:13.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul said, "Having done all, to stand."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must stand and not allow Satan to continue wearing us out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May the Lord open our eyes to see Satan's wearing-out work on God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to reject this, and we have to speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to say, "I reject this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I oppose this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I do not accept this wearing out."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must not accept any kind of wearing out from Satan; we should oppose it and reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we do this, we will witness the Lord's deliverance and release, and we will be freed from Satan's wearing-out work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Such words require the covering of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>May God cover us with the blood.</S>
