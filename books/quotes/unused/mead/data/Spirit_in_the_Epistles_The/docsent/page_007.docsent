   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KEY TO THE BOOK OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans is a book that particularly gives an outline of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It speaks clearly concerning three great matters to which every Christian must pay attention.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first great matter concerns our salvation or, we may say, justification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second great matter is on how we should live in the Spirit after we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The third matter is on how, by such a living, we may become living members to live the church life, the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It speaks first about our salvation, then about our living in the Spirit, and then about our service and coordination in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our salvation is for us to live in the Spirit, and by living in the Spirit we become living members coordinating in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, living in the Spirit is the key to the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Formerly we were sinners and also enemies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We offended Him and had a problem with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus, however, reconciled us to God by dying for us sinners and solving the problems between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, today when we believe in the Lord, we are justified and have no more problems with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what the Lord's death has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After we have been saved, we have the life of the Lord Jesus in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, this life sets us free from all kinds of bondage, such as the world, the flesh, the law of sin, and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, this life is saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With regard to our bondage, we need to be freed; with regard to our fallen condition, we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus is doing the work not only of setting us free to deliver us from all kinds of bondage but also of saving us day by day and moment by moment so that we may come out of our fallen situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, He is doing the work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fourth, He is doing the work of sanctification to set us apart and make us holy so that we may be separated from all things and all worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fifth, eventually He will glorify us to make us as glorious as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dear brothers and sisters, all these items are included in our being saved in the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our salvation through the death of the Lord Jesus resolves the problems we had with God in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our being saved in the life of the Lord allows Him to work in us to set us free, to save us, to transform us, to sanctify us, and to glorify us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How does the Lord Jesus carry out all these works in us?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It all hinges on His being a living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the first section of Romans shows us that the Lord Jesus died for us on the cross, and the second section shows us that He is in us living instead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Previously Christ died on the cross, but now He is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The clause in the beginning of Romans 8:10, "Christ is in you," is a great word; it is the key to the entire book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God works to such an extent that Christ is wrought into us, and this Christ who is in us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Romans this Spirit has four different titles: first, the Spirit of life; second, the Spirit of sonship; third, the Spirit of firstfruits; and fourth, the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have a clear view of these few points, then you have grasped the key to Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Over the years, among the children of God many books were written concerning Romans, but the key to this book was never clearly pointed out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At this time I hope to impress you with this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The key to this book is "Christ in you," and this Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some may ask, "How can Christ be this Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a mystery that is hard to explain thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says that "the Lord is the Spirit"; then it goes on to refer to "the Spirit of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, it says that "the Lord is the Spirit"; hence, the Lord and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, it mentions "the Spirit of the Lord"; hence, the Lord and the Spirit are two.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the two aspects are mentioned together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When it says that the Word was with God, it means that the Word and God are two.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet it also says that the Word was God, meaning that They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, They are two yet one and one yet two.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although we do not understand this doctrine, we still need to accept this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Christ who dwells in us is the Spirit.</S>
