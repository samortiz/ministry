JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT AND JUDGMENT<br>UPON KEDAR AND THE KINGDOMS OF HAZOR</H2><P>In Jeremiah 49:28-33 we are told of Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor<br>Being Arabia, Which Typifies the World<br>That Mixes with the People of God</H2><P>Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor are Arabia (Ezek. 27:21). The people of Kedar were the descendants of Ishmael (Gen. 25:13), and they were nomadic (Psa. 120:5; S.S. 1:5; Isa. 60:7). Hazor was very much involved with Israel (Josh. 11:10-13; Judg. 4:2-3; 1 Sam. 12:9). Arabia typifies the world that mixes with the people of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B.

Nebuchadnezzar had taken counsel against them and had devised a plan against them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Hazor Becoming a Habitation of Jackals,<br>an Eternal Desolation</H2><P>Verse 33 declares that Hazor, which once was a good place for flocks, would become a habitation of jackals, an eternal desolation. No one would dwell there; neither would a son of man sojourn in it (cf. Isa. 21:13-17).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_164.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_166.html">Next</a> </body></html>
