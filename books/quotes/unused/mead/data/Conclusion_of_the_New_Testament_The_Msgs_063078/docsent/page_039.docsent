   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO CHRIST HIS WORK 10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of Christ's work in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we shall go on to consider His work in His burial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>18.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Tasting Death on Behalf of Everything</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 2:9 says that the Lord Jesus tasted death on behalf of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He tasted death not only for human beings but also for every creature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that Christ's redemption was accomplished not only for people but for everything created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus God could reconcile all things to Himself by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Colossians 1:20 says that God has reconciled all things to Himself through the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is clearly typified by the redemption of Noah's ark, in which not only eight persons but all other living things created by God were saved Gen 7:13-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ark is a type, a picture, of Christ in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Hebrews 2:9 we have the profound revelation that Christ tasted death not only for man but also for all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Due to the sin of Adam, the head of the old creation, everything is under death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His work on the cross Christ tasted this death, a death on behalf of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason we say that Christ's death was an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nullifying Death</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 Timothy 1:10 Paul tells us that through His work in His death Christ nullified death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word translated "nullified" also means make of none effect, bring to naught, do away with, abolish, annul, discard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through His Devil-destroying death, Christ nullified death, making it of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To nullify death does not mean to remove death but to make it of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death will not be removed until it is cast into the lake of fire after the millennium Rev 20:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Death will be the last enemy destroyed by the Lord 1 Cor 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although death has not yet been removed, it is none the less a fact that it has been nullified through Christ's death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Causing the Rulers and Authorities to Be Stripped Off, to Be Made a Display of Openly, and to Be Triumphed Over in the Cross by God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Colossians 2:15 says, "Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see that in His work on the cross Christ caused the rulers and authorities to be stripped off, to be made a display of openly, and to be triumphed over in the cross by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The rulers and authorities spoken of in this verse are the angelic rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek word for "stripping off" can also be rendered "putting off."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek word for "make a display" means show or exhibit in the sense of putting to an open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God openly shamed the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Greek words translated "in it" refer to the cross, but they can also be rendered "in Him," referring to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a very real sense the cross of Christ is the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items in the universe, an archangel rebelled and many angels followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This archangel became Satan, and his followers became the evil rulers, powers, and authorities in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, the man created by God fell and became sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, Christ, God incarnate, went to the cross to work for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While Christ was on the cross, many things took place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time the cross was the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Savior, sin, Satan, we, and God were all there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While God was judging sin, the evil rulers and authorities were present and were very active, swarming around the crucified Christ, pressing in very closely.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they had not pressed in closely, God could not have stripped them off.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words "stripping off" indicate that the rulers and authorities were very close, as close as our garments are to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By stripping off the rulers and authorities God made a display of them openly, putting them to shame and triumphing over them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Colossians 2:15 portrays the warfare that took place at the time of Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In His crucifixion Christ was working to accomplish redemption, and God the Father was working to judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time the rulers and authorities were busy in the attempt to frustrate the work of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reference to triumph in Colossians 2:15 implies fighting; it indicates that a war was raging.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While Christ was working to accomplish redemption, the rulers and authorities came to interfere, pressing in close to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But at that very juncture God stripped them off, triumphed over them, and made a display of them openly, putting them to an open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ's work in His death caused all this to take place.</S>
