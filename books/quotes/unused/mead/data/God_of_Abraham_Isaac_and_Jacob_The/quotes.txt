[3]  Watchman Nee gave a series of studies on the characters of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the early part of 1940.
[4]  These messages were published in Chinese in 1955 by the Taiwan Gospel Bookroom under the title, The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[5]  In order to bring a group of people to come under His name, and in order to make them His people, God did a special work in three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, respectively, and gave each one of them particular experiences.
[6]  May God bless this book and its readers and guide us to a full knowledge of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob so that we can become vessels of God's testimony.
[7]  CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Exo 3:6, 15-16; Matt 22:31-32 ONE
[8]  First Corinthians 10:11 says, "Now these things happened to them as an example..."
[9]  Without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be the nation of Israel, and without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be a people of God.
[10]  Why do Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob occupy such a special place in the Bible?
[11]  It is because God wants to select a group of people to come under His name and to make them His people.
[12]  Beginning with Abraham, God began to gain a people.
[13]  God had a spiritual beginning with Abraham, and He did something in Abraham for the purpose of showing us the necessary experience that God's people have to go through.
[14]  Hence, God has worked not only in Abraham, but also in Isaac, giving him some particular experiences, and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people as well.
[15]  Later God changed his name to Abraham Gen 17:5 .
[16]  Abraham was a father himself, and the lesson he learned was to know God as the Father.
[17]  Galatians 4 says that Isaac is the promised son v. 23 . In Isaac we see that everything comes from the Father.
[18]  The history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in Genesis 11 through 50 shows us that Isaac was an ordinary and unexceptional man.
[19]  The outstanding characteristic of Jacob's natural constitution was his cleverness.
[20]  We have mentioned previously that God desires to gain a group of men who are called by His name and who are His people.
[21]  He wants to gain a group of people who can say that they belong to God and that they are God's people.
[22]  In order to achieve this goal, He first worked on Abraham, then on Isaac, and finally on Jacob.
[23]  In other words, although many people can be called by God's name and outwardly be known as God's people, they are not qualified to become God's people unless they see that everything they have is from God, that everything is received, and that everything of the natural life has to be laid aside by God.
[24]  We must see that Abraham is different from all the other men.
[25]  From the time that Adam sinned, there has been a line of sin.
[26]  Although Abel was a good man, he could not deal with the line of sin; although Enoch was a good man, he could not deal with the tide of sin either; and although Noah was a good man, he could not change the sinful situation.
[27]  God's purpose in calling Abraham was to recover man from the sinful situation.
[28]  Abraham's being chosen by God was for the purpose of recovering man from his sinful situation.
[29]  God called Abraham not only for the purpose of bringing him to the land that He would show him but also for the purpose of making a great nation out of him.
[30]  God called Abraham with the purpose of making him and his descendants His people.
[31]  In the Old Testament there was a nation, Israel, because God wanted a people on this earth, that is, He wanted a group of people who were separated unto God, who were for His glory, and who belonged to Him.
[32]  God also said to Abraham, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed" Gen 12:3 .
[33]  Now we will consider how Abraham was called to follow God.
[34]  In reading Joshua 24, we find that Abraham was born into a family that served idols.
[35]  This shows us that "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" Rom 9:16 .
[36]  CHAPTER THREE ABRAHAM AND THE LAND OF CANAAN Scripture Reading: Acts 7:2; Gen 12:4 13:18; 14:11-23
[37]  After Abraham arrived in Canaan, the Bible tells us that the first place he went to was Sichem or Shechem .
[38]  Bethel the House of God the Body of Christ
[39]  "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord" Gen 12:8 .
[40]  One characteristic of Canaan is that God's people are the temple of God and the house of God.
[41]  "Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord" Gen 13:18 .
[42]  After Abraham arrived in Canaan, the Bible shows us that he was tested three times concerning the land of Canaan.
[43]  After Abraham returned to Canaan, he encountered the second test.
[44]  God showed Abraham that although he had obeyed half of God's commandment to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house, he had not yet obeyed the other half; he had not parted with Lot.
[45]  CHAPTER FOUR ABRAHAM AND HIS SON 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 4:3, 17-22; Gal 4:23-26, 28; Gen 15 16:4a, 15-16 GOD'S PROMISE AND ABRAHAM'S FAITH
[46]  The matter of Canaan was settled for Abraham, but from Genesis 15, we see the matter of his son.
[47]  Verses 4 through 6 say, "And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
[48]  Abraham "divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another...behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
[49]  God showed Abraham that his inheritance of the land was based on the work of the cross, and that his seed was able to stand in this land through the death of the cross.
[50]  Genesis 15:5 says, "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
[51]  But when God was telling Abraham of the multiplicity of his descendants, He used the word "seed" in the singular.
[52]  It is not a simple thing to usher in Isaac.
[53]  The Bible specifically says that "Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan" v. 3 . When Abraham first arrived in Canaan, God promised, "Unto thy seed will I give this land" 12:7 . Just before these events God promised him again, "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir." By the time he was eighty-five years old, however, he still had no son.
[54]  It was not a question of whether Abraham should have a son.
[55]  Genesis 16 says that Abraham begot Ishmael when he was eighty-six years old.
[56]  Genesis 21 tells us that by the time Abraham begot Isaac, he was already a hundred years old v. 5 . Romans 4 tells us that when he was about a hundred years old, Abraham considered his own body as already dead and Sarah's womb as being deadened v. 19 . In other words, his fleshly energy and natural strength were gone.
[57]  This means that God wanted Abraham to consider himself as a dying, and even dead, person so that he could trust in the God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.
[58]  Romans 4:19-22 says, "And not weakening in his faith, he considered his own body as already dead, being about a hundred years old, as well as the deadening of Sarah's womb; but with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able also to do.
[59]  We should note that Abraham's justification by faith in these verses is different in time from that spoken of in Romans 4:3, which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness."
[60]  CHAPTER FIVE ABRAHAM AND HIS SON 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 16:16 18; 20:1-2, 10-13, 17-18; 21:1-3, 10; Col 2:11; Phil 3:3 Abraham's Circumcision
[61]  God promised Abraham a son, but Abraham did not wait on God for his son; he married a concubine and gave birth to a son Ishmael.
[62]  After he begot Ishmael, there was a thirteen-year period in which God did not speak to him Gen 16:16 17:1 .
[63]  After thirteen years, Abraham was ninety-nine years of age and was becoming old.
[64]  The name Almighty God in the original language can be translated as "all-sufficient God."
[65]  Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."
[66]  Philippians 3:3 says, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."
[67]  The greatest problem with God's children is that their flesh is not dealt with before the Lord.
[68]  They believe in the flesh and put their trust in the flesh.
[69]  After being dealt with by God for so many years, what kind of person did Abraham become?
[70]  Then God said to him, "As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
[71]  In chapter eighteen, after Abraham believed and was circumcised, his fellowship with God became more intimate.
[72]  This shows that he was indeed a friend of God.
[73]  The women in the house of Abimelech could not bear children.
[74]  Why did they bear children again when Abraham prayed and God healed them?
[75]  After Abraham realized that God is the Father through his intercession for the women in Abimelech's house, Sarah bore him a son at God's appointed time.
[76]  The day Isaac was weaned, God spoke a word through Sarah: "Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac" v. 10 . This was not Sarah's jealousy.
[77]  There was no question about Isaac; he was indeed given by God and indeed a son according to His promise.
[78]  The deep lesson that we have to learn before the Lord is that we cannot get ourselves directly involved with any of the things that God has given to us.
[79]  This still has not touched the crux of the matter.
[80]  Whether Isaac represents a gift or an experience, this application merely touches our fleshly life.
[81]  There is another important thing: Isaac represents God's will, which God had spoken to Abraham.
[82]  But the lesson that God is really teaching us is to give up our own will so that we will do what God wants us to do and not do what He does not want us to do.
[83]  When he heard that God wanted him to offer up Isaac, he did not feel that this was a difficult thing to do.
[84]  Everything was for God, and he did not argue with God.
[85]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ISAAC Scripture Reading: Gen 25:5-6, 11a; 26:1-5, 23-24
[86]  In reading the history of Abraham, we have to realize that it is not only a description of Abraham's experience in being dealt with by the Lord, but it is also a description of the standard by which God deals with all of His people.
[87]  We have seen the meaning of the God of Abraham.
[88]  On the one hand, God led him to realize that He is the Father.
[89]  We have to pay attention to two things in Isaac's life.
[90]  The first is Isaac's relationship with Abraham, and the second is Isaac's relationship with God.
[91]  From these two relationships, we can see Isaac's characteristics.
[92]  Knowing the God of Isaac means only one thing: knowing God as the Supplier and that everything comes from Him.
[93]  There are things that they do not want to do, but they realize that God wants them to do these things.
[94]  Isaac shows us the riches of the resurrection life of Christ which God has given to His children, while Jacob shows us how God deals with the natural life, the soulish life, and the fleshly energy until one day the root is cut off, and the hollow of the thigh is touched.
[95]  We need a vision before God like Abraham had, we need a life like Isaac had, and we need the discipline of the Holy Spirit like Jacob had.
[96]  If we know the God of Isaac, we will have the confidence to say, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ" 2 Cor 2:14 .
[97]  Just as God revealed Himself to Abraham and became the God of Abraham, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God.
[98]  GOD'S PROVISIONS IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 3:26-29; 4:6-7, 28, 31; 5:1; John 15:4a; Rom 6:5-7, 11; Eph 2:4-6; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a; 1 Cor 1:30 THE INHERITANCE GOD HAS PREPARED IN CHRIST
[99]  We have to realize that all of God's provisions in Christ are our inheritance.
[100]  If we want to understand the extent of God's inheritance for us and if we want to know the extent of the enjoyment of our inheritance, we must see that we are in Christ and that Christ is in us.
[101]  If we only know that we are in Christ, but do not know that Christ is in us, we will be weak and empty, and everything will be theoretical.
[102]  When we are in Christ, our past is terminated and we are ushered into the present, in which God has given us another part to our inheritance in Christ.
[103]  God has given us Christ for only one purpose: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" Gal 2:20 .
[104]  Let us read 1 Corinthians 1:30 again: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."
[105]  If we want to go on, we have to commit ourselves to the Almighty God and allow Him to reveal Himself to us as the Father at the proper time.
[106]  We have to see that nothing from ourselves will satisfy His heart and that everything must be of Him, because only God is the Father.
[107]  THE DISCIPLINE HE RECEIVED Scripture Reading: Gen 25:19-34; 27 30
[108]  Every careful reader of the Word of God cannot fail to find a great difference between the history of Isaac and the history of Jacob.
[109]  Let us consider the way that God accomplished His work in Jacob how God disciplined him, dealt with his natural life, and weakened him, how God caused Christ to be formed in him through the constitution of the Holy Spirit, and how he bore the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[110]  Let us begin with the first section of Jacob's history.
[111]  One day Esau came back from his hunting in the field and was fainting.
[112]  Genesis 28:10-11 says, "And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
[113]  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
[114]  And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
[115]  Then Jacob said, "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.
[116]  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" vv.
[117]  "And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first" v. 19 . Then Jacob vowed, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" vv.
[118]  Genesis 29 tells us that Jacob went to the land of the people of the east and saw the shepherds who came from Haran.
[119]  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
[120]  When he arrived at his uncle Laban's house, his uncle said to him, "Surely thou art my bone and my flesh," and Jacob abode with him for a month v. 14 . After being a guest of his uncle for a month, his uncle said in a seemingly polite way, "Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?" v. 15 . From this word we see that Laban's mind was also the mind of a businessman.
[121]  But thank the Lord that this was God's hand upon him.
[122]  OF JACOB'S NATURAL LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 31 35
[123]  The night before he caught up with Jacob, God spoke to Laban in a dream: "Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad" v. 24 . God would not allow Laban to say anything, because He was leading Jacob out of the place of trial and was taking him home.
[124]  Genesis 32:1-2 says, "And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
[125]  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
[126]  Formerly, God had sought after him, now he sought after God.
[127]  "And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
[128]  He called God the "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac."
[129]  When we do not trust in God and when we contrive by ourselves and are satisfied with ourselves, we have to admit that God cannot prevail over us.
[130]  It is true that Jacob was very capable and that his fleshly life and natural energy were stronger than anyone else's. But in the end God prevailed over him.
[131]  If God had wrestled with him according to the usual way, the wrestling might have lasted for twenty years.
[132]  In order for a Christian to take God's way, he must receive everything from Christ.
[133]  We need God to touch the hollow of our thigh, to weaken us, and to put us out of joint.
[134]  Some may ask, "What is the meaning of Peniel?
[135]  Jacob was touched by God in the hollow of his thigh at Peniel, and his leg was crippled.
[136]  Jacob's thigh hollow was put out of joint when he wrestled with God.
[137]  Jacob became crippled after Peniel, but he still did not know what he had experienced.
[138]  They think that Jacob should have stopped his activities because he had been touched by God.
[139]  Esau returned to Seir, and Jacob set off to Succoth.
[140]  "And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city" v. 18 .
[141]  God wanted Jacob to go back to his father's land, but he remained in Shechem.
[142]  Genesis 35:1 says, "And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
[143]  Bethel was a place that particularly touched Jacob's heart because he dreamed and God appeared to him there.
[144]  After God spoke this, He went up from him v. 13 . When Jacob met God previously, he erected a stone to be a pillar, poured oil on it, and called the name of the place the house of God.
[145]  Verse 16 says, "And they journeyed from Bethel."
[146]  Verse 27 says, "And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
[147]  This means that we need to know Bethel as the house of God just as we need to know Shechem as the power of God.
[148]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MATURITY OF JACOB Scripture Reading: Gen 37; 42 49
[149]  After Jacob was dealt with by God at Peniel, he began to recognize his own weakness and was gradually changed.
[150]  However, this does not mean that Jacob needed no further dealings from God after Peniel.
[151]  At this point we have completed our study of the third stage of Jacob's history.
[152]  In the first stage of his history, we saw his disposition.
[153]  In the third stage of his history, we saw that God not only disciplined him, but also dealt with his being and his natural life.
[154]  Even after his natural life had been thoroughly dealt with, we see that the discipline of God was still upon him.
[155]  God dealt with him in this way for the purpose of creating in him a character that he did not possess before.
[156]  All the above is not enough to reveal Jacob's shining brightness.
[157]  Later when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, his spirit revived, and "Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die" v. 28 . We need to note when the Bible calls him Jacob and when it calls him Israel.
[158]  He came to Egypt, saw Joseph, and settled in the land of Goshen.
[159]  Genesis 47:7 says, "And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
[160]  His days on earth were coming to an end. During the time he lived in the land of Goshen, not much happened to him; he just lived a simple life.
[161]  In chapter forty-eight he became sick, and Joseph brought his two sons to visit him.
[162]  Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession" vv.
[163]  He did not remember how he competed with his brother, how he gained the birthright, or how he took his brother's blessing, etc. All he remembered was his relationship with God.
[164]  We only need to consider one thing to find out the great difference between this person and the Jacob of the past.
[165]  When Simeon and Levi slew all the males in the city because of the incident with Dinah, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house" Gen 34:30 .
[166]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Heb 12:5-7, 9-11; Gal 5:22-23; 4:19; 1 Cor 3:12, 14; Gen 2:12; Phil 4:11-12
[167]  The title "the God of Jacob" implies how the Holy Spirit disciplined Jacob, how He dealt with Jacob's natural life, how He constituted Christ into Jacob, and how He bore the fruit of the Spirit in Jacob.
[168]  If we want to know the God of Jacob, we have to know the constitution by the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit.
[169]  If we want to know the God of Jacob, we need to allow the Spirit to perform His work in us, to deal with our natural life, to constitute Christ into our inward being, and to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit in us so that we can become the vessels of God's testimony.
[170]  God deals with our natural life for the purpose of ushering us into the carving work of the Spirit, the processing by the Spirit, and the constituting of the Spirit.
[171]  Galatians 5:22-23 says, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control."
[172]  This shows us that "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control" are not virtues given to us by the Holy Spirit, but are fruit borne by the Holy Spirit in us.
[173]  We need to pay special attention to three portions of the Scripture.
