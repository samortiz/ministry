<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Father's House</H2><P>The Father's house for His dwelling (John 14:2) refers to the divine family with the children born of God (1:12-13) and to Bethel (the house of God) as the place for the heavenly ladder to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven (1:51). The Father's house is also the temple of God as the house of God, which was Christ Himself before His resurrection and was enlarged with His believers through His resurrection (2:16-22). Furthermore, the Father's house is a mutual abode for the Triune God and the believers built up by the Father and the Son (14:23), consummating in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21). The Spirit indwells this abode with the Father and the Son for the mutual dwelling place of the Triune God and His transformed elect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Son's Vine</H2><P>This constitution is also expressed as the Son's vine tree for His spreading to express the Father (John 15:1-16). The Father needs a dwelling place, a house, and the Son needs the spreading, which is an organic union of the Son as the tree with His believers as the branches (vv. 1-5). We are branches of the Triune God in the Son! A pine tree can be very tall, but a vine tree spreads along the earth. Years ago when I was in England, someone took me to see the Queen's vine. I told them that I had seen a bigger vine which spreads around the globe. That is not the Queen's vine but the King's vine. The Son is the vine and we are the branches to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father, that is, the expression, spreading, and multiplication of the Father as its source and Husbandman (vv. 1, 4-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Spirit's Child</H2><P>The Father needs a house for His dwelling, the Son needs a vine for His spreading, and the Spirit needs a child for His moving (16:20-22). This child is the new babe growing up into the new man. The new man is Christ. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members (Col. 3:10-11).</P><P>This new child was created by Christ on the cross by abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15). Christ abolished the ordinances of the law that separated people from one another. Through that He created the Jews and the Gentiles together into one new man. In one sense, the one new man was created; in another sense, he was born by the Spirit as a new child. His members were regenerated by the Father in Christ's resurrection to be God's children, who are the constituents of the house of God (1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12-13). First Peter 1:3 says that we all were regenerated by God the Father through the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>The new child was also born by the Spirit in the believers' spirit (John 3:6b). God's elect are the suffering, delivering woman (16:20-21). On the one hand, we are the child born; on the other hand, we are the delivering woman. We are the mother and the child as well. This is a mystery. Furthermore, this child as the returning Christ left the disciples by His death. In John 16:22 the Lord told the disciples, "Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you." That newborn child was Christ coming back. Thus, God's elect are the mother as well as the child, and the child is Christ. Now He is the new man (Col. 3:10-11). In the new man there is no room for any natural person. There is only room for Christ. He is all the members, and He is in all the members. This new man is put on by the believers through the renewing in the spirit of their mind (Eph. 4:23-24) and consummates the Body of Christ.</P>
