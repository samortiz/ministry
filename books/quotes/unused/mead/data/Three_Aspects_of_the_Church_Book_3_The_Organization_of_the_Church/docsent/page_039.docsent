   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING SPIRITUAL Resurrection and the Holy Spirit Being Inseparable</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is something entirely in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone who has experienced resurrection and the Holy Spirit knows that resurrection and the Holy Spirit cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Doctrinally, resurrection is resurrection, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit; however, experientially, the two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be in resurrection is to be in the Holy Spirit, and to be in the Holy Spirit is to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus entered into His glory when He resurrected Luke 24:26 ; hence, the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In incarnation God became a man, the Lord Jesus, and in resurrection the Lord Jesus became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what John 14 reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God became the Lord Jesus through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus then became the Spirit through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the Spirit cannot be separated from resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the evening of the day of the Lord s resurrection, He came and stood in the midst of the disciples and breathed into them, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit 20:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit whom the disciples received was the Spirit anticipated in John 7:39.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, to be in resurrection is to be in the Holy Spirit; to say it in reverse, to be in the Holy Spirit is to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Church Existing Only in the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a brother s feelings are stirred up when he is criticized or praised, this indicates that his feelings are not in resurrection and not in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if he allows his feelings to be condemned, rejected, and judged, and they rise up again, they will be in resurrection and in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, in our experience resurrection and the Holy Spirit cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To live in one s self is to live in the natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To live in the Holy Spirit is to live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The two the Holy Spirit and resurrection are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a brother is having problems, it is common to suggest that he be visited by a brother who has a friendly relationship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this suggestion from the Spirit or from the mind?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Undoubtedly, it is from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, is this suggestion of resurrection or is it natural?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely, it is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have seen this principle, we will realize that our good intentions are outside of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are in our self and not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church life people often suggest certain methods to help the brothers and sisters who live together pass through certain dealings so that they will become well behaved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are these dealings in the Spirit or outside the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, it is difficult for us to discern what is of the Spirit and what is natural, but on the other hand, deep within we are able to discern and know whether something is in our self or in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is marvelous that although it is not easy for us to distinguish what is of the Spirit and what is of the self, deep within we are able to know what is of the Spirit and what is of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is entirely a matter of being in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is not a matter of being truthful or being false.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt, there is no falsehood in the church, but neither is the church a matter merely of truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The problem is that man pays more attention to such matters as good or evil and truthfulness or falsehood than to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, there is not much manifestation of the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to God s design, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, the Lord Jesus, including all that He is and has accomplished, has become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the church is the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Apart from the Spirit, there is no Christ, and apart from the Spirit, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, apart from the Spirit, the riches of Christ cannot be expressed among us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man s positive attributes, goodness, and virtues are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church can be expressed only when we reject these things and live in the Holy Spirit.</S>
