<h1 class="title">CHANGING THE CONCEPT IN OUR SERVICE&mdash;<br />
TEACHING AND PERFECTING OTHERS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">STUDYING THE FACTORS<br />
THAT HINDER THE INCREASE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to study the factors that have hindered our increase. In the beginning of the work in Taiwan there was a rapid increase in numbers, but after a period of time we seemed to have come to a stop, and no matter what we did, there was not much increase.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doing Things Ourselves and<br />
Being Unable to Teach Others</h2>
<p>After spending time with the Lord and analyzing our situation, we are clearer concerning our situation. A primary problem has been that the co-workers do things themselves and have not been able to teach others. Suppose three brothers go to a new locality to serve. Since they have a heart for the Lord, new ones are gained. If the co-workers teach these new ones, raise them up, perfect them, and bring them into the service, the co-workers will gain some &ldquo;apprentices.&rdquo; It is regrettable, however, that we have neither learned to bring the saints into the service nor learned to perfect the saints. Instead, we do everything by ourselves and thus unconsciously replace the saints. As a result, the saints do not know how to function, and the responsible ones do everything.</p>
<p>The scope of what two or three people can do is limited. Hence, if we cannot teach and lead others, the work will come to a standstill. Then the Lord will have to lead the co-workers to another place where there are no saints, where the work has not reached. The co-workers can then gain new believers and labor until the work again comes to a standstill. At that time, they will have to move to yet another place.</p>
<p>If the co-workers do not move to a new location, there will be no possibility for increase, because the co-workers always work by themselves and do not bring others into function. A person can do only a limited amount of work. Although the other saints can also do a limited amount of work, it will be difficult for them if their function is not manifested. If we continue in this way, there is no way for the church in a locality to spread. Since we do not teach the new ones how to bring others into function, they will repeat our pattern of doing everything by themselves. After a period of time any work in their hands will also come to a standstill, and the church will not spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Teaching Others and<br />
Not Coordinating with Others</h2>
<p>If we cannot bring others into the things that we do, we cannot teach them. If we cannot teach others, we cannot coordinate with others. These are the two main factors that frustrate the spread. Our inability to coordinate with others is not related to being at odds with them; rather, it is the consequence of not having a disposition and habit to coordinate. It is wrong to think that we can do everything and that we have no need of others. If the work assigns a second co-worker to serve in a local church, but the first co-worker still does all the work, the second co-worker will not be able to enter into the work. This deficiency is not the result of unwillingness on the part of the new co-worker. Nor is it related to any resentment toward the first co-worker. Rather, it is because the first co-worker cannot coordinate with another person; hence, the two cannot work together. In this case, each co-worker is a separate cord, and they cannot be twined into a twofold cord, much less a threefold cord (Eccl. 4:12). This limits the increase in a local church.</p>
<p>This is an example of not being able to teach others, not being able to work with others, and not being able to coordinate with others. As co-workers, we should be able to teach others and also to coordinate with them. A co-worker serving in a local church should be able to serve and also to teach others to serve. A skillful carpenter can produce something useful out of any type of wood. Similarly, a co-worker should be able to use any saint, no matter what their situation is in life. At the same time, he should be able to work with many other co-workers without any conflict. In his coordination with others, everyone should be able to function according to their portion.</p>
<p>If the Lord can open our eyes to see this matter and to have a fundamental turn, it will not be difficult for the churches to increase twofold in two years. However, if we cannot turn, we will not increase. We will only maintain the status quo because we will limit the work. Hence, we must have a radical and thorough turn. We must be able to teach others and coordinate with others. Whether or not we are capable, we must coordinate with others and serve together with the saints. If some are not capable, we need to learn how to teach the saints and coordinate with them. If we are capable, there is an even greater need to teach others and coordinate with them.</p>
<p>The co-workers who are limited in capacity should not give up. They should never give up. The co-workers who have some capacity must not look down on others. Even the most capable co-worker cannot bear up the entire work. We need to coordinate with others. Regardless of how capable a person is, he is unable to bear a church or even a district. In order to uphold a church, we must coordinate with others.</p>
<p>All the co-workers must change their concept and realize that everyone has some capacity. The co-workers who think that they are incapable must endeavor. If they cannot teach the saints, they should follow and learn from other co-workers. Those who are capable should teach the saints instead of doing the work alone. The co-workers should also perfect the saints, regardless of the saints&rsquo; ability. It is better for the saints to make mistakes than for them to be idle. In this way everyone will be given an opportunity to serve, and we will learn more. We learn when we do things, but we learn more when we teach others. If we do not teach others, our learning is incomplete. When we teach others, we are forced to consider things thoroughly. We may think that we know how to arrange the chairs, but it is not easy to teach another person to arrange the chairs. Teaching requires skill. We may be able to do something but be unable to teach another person to do it. When we are able to do something and are also able to teach others, we will be truly skilled. Teaching others will also cause us to be dealt with. If we have a strong personality or are peculiar, we will be dealt with when we teach others. It is difficult to successfully teach others without being dealt with. We must never say that a saint cannot be taught because he has no capacity.</p>
