   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subdividing the Groups to Produce Increase</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past month the number of saints meeting in the small groups, that is, in the home meetings, has increased by one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have said that once a small group has more than twelve people, it should be subdivided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this time some groups have exceeded twenty-four people, yet they are still reluctant to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I understand this feeling, because I too am human.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A certain hall has a very good small group that has brought in more than a hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I attended their meeting once, and it was bustling with people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The saints in that small group told me that they did not want to be subdivided because they like that small group.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I dared not touch them lest some would stop meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are like plants in a green house that would die if they are moved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, human beings are sociable by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a group of people are always together, they build up a feeling for one another and like to be close and intimate with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we must see that if we do not subdivide the groups and the homes, the increase will stop, and the edification of the brothers and sisters will be greatly limited.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that the group we mentioned earlier has stopped increasing and is now at a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see this situation in other places as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The biological principle is that it is difficult for anything old to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spiritual principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose a family migrates to a new place to spread the Lord s gospel and preach God s truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within a year this family may be able to bring in fifteen people, and then they may increase to thirty or fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once they reach fifty, however, their rate of increase will slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is similar to an old person being unable to bear children and an old tree not bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For a tree to bear fruit, it must have new branches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If these fifty people want to bear fruit, they must be subdivided into different homes and into small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this may be difficult for them emotionally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, people usually love crowds.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is truly enjoyable to have many gathered together to sing and pray when the content and speaking of the meeting is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they are subdivided into different homes, they are concerned about losing this kind of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they remain together, however, it will be difficult for them to gain an increase.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For instance, when planting trees and grass, if we do not scatter the seeds, they will end up clustered together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we scatter the seeds, they may initially appear uncomely, but a year or even half a year later they will spread all over the land and look beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that the elders will change their concept to see that subdividing the small groups is a tremendous matter and that they need to work on this carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there are presently six people in a home meeting, there would be one thousand small groups in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These small groups might be very weak, but as long as the elders are willing to take the lead and aggressively take care of the saints, eventually the small groups will be strong, and the numbers will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not a matter of whether the small groups will be weak or strong; it is a matter of whether or not the elders are willing to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the elders are willing to take the lead, there will certainly be a result.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past month the number of saints meeting in the small groups in Taipei increased by one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the result of the labor and endeavor of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This also proves that as long as the elders are willing to take the lead, the saints will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our brothers and sisters have many relatives, friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the elders are aggressive to take the lead, it will not be difficult for every home to gain one person a month.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If every home gains a person each month, the church in Taipei will gain a thousand people in a month and twelve thousand in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a twofold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, the new ones gained in this way are more likely to be remaining fruit, because they were not compelled to come from off the streets and be saved and baptized; neither were they invited through gospel tracts or telephone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, they are the relatives and intimate friends of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, it will be easy for them to be kept and to receive edification.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This kind of increase is the most effective and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are the two steps, or two ways, to practice the changing of the system.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first step is to recover the non-meeting saints by delivering meetings to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we cannot do it once a week, we can at least do it once every two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, we need to be steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The second step is to subdivide the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once a small group has over twelve people, it should be subdivided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This will stir up the spirit of the saints to spread the gospel among their relatives, friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>BEING ABSOLUTE AND SERIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>IN PRACTICING THE NEW WAY Serving Faithfully and Diligently</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are those who belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the Lord in whom we believe is not false, and if He is worthy of our believing in Him, we need to be serious, absolute, and faithful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have seven days in a week.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Besides the Lord s Day, which we set apart for the Lord, we should consecrate at least one evening to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The practice of the new way does not require the brothers and sisters to give a whole day to the Lord; it requires only one evening from 7:00 to 11:00 P.M. Moreover, this is a demonstration of our service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way our friends, relatives, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues will know that every week we have a definite evening, from 7:00 to 11:00, when we meet in a small group to preach the gospel and study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This period of time should be very free.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>People can come at any time and stay as long as they want.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They can come to have a meal, drink some tea, or eat some fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, the door of grace will be wide open for the spreading of the gospel and the genuine edification and exercise of the saints.</S>
