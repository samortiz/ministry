A Watcher, a Holy One,<br>Coming Down from Heaven and Saying<br>That the Tree Should Be Cut Down</H2><P>In his dream Nebuchadnezzar saw "a watcher, indeed, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, Cut down the tree and destroy it; yet leave its stump of roots in the earth, but with an iron and bronze band around it, in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him" (v. 23). In his interpretation Daniel explained that this signifies that the Most High God had decreed that Nebuchadnezzar would be driven out from among mankind, dwell with the beasts of the field, be made to eat grass as bulls, and lose his reasoning for a period of seven times, until he came to know that the Most High is the Ruler over the kingdom of men (vv. 24-25). Verse 26 goes on to say, "In that it was commanded that the stump of roots of the tree be left, your kingdom will be assured to you after you have come to know that the heavens do rule."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. DANIEL'S COUNSEL TO NEBUCHADNEZZAR</H2><P>After interpreting the dream, Daniel offered counsel to Nebuchadnezzar. He advised him, saying, "Break off your sins by doing righteousness and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, if there is a prolonging of your prosperity" (v. 27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V.

Nebuchadnezzar's Word as He Walked<br>upon the Roof of the Royal Palace of Babylon</H2><P>After Daniel exhorted Nebuchadnezzar, God gave him twelve months to repent. However, there was no repentance and no change. One day while the king was walking upon the roof of the royal palace in Babylon, he looked at the great city and was filled with pride, saying, "Is this not Babylon the great, which I have built up as a royal house by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?" (v. 30).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
