   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 1:"In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"In that hour" can be translated "at the same time."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is connected with the fishing in the preceding portion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fishing there indicates that the Lord covers His own glory and manifests His own grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first section of chapter eighteen indicates how the believers in the present life should imitate the Lord in hiding their own glory, manifesting grace, and giving up their privileges.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The disciples argued concerning this matter several times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was truly an unsolvable problem to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even on the night the Lord was betrayed, they were still arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On this occasion the disciples were arguing because: 1 nine people had been left at the foot of the mountain 17:1 ; 2 Peter was called Petros 16:18 , the rock for the building; 3 the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were placed in Peter's hands 16:19 ; and 4 the Lord had paid the temple tax for Peter 17:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All men like to be great; no one likes to be small.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Men aspire to great achievements within their limits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is not one person who does not desire to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 2:"And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord used not only parables but also demonstrations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He called a little child to stand among the disciples, to make a comparison with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One can know a child by a glance; there is no need to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning many matters, there is no need to ask; one only needs to look.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 3:"And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Turn" indicates regeneration; it is to begin a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Become like little children."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that we should behave like children, but that we should become children; it is not to be childish like a child.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One who can pretend to be a child is surely not a child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only a wise man can pretend to be a fool.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone who lives in this world must pass through the stage of being a child.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, everyone who enters into the kingdom of the heavens must pass through the stage of being a child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are three explanations concerning the kingdom of the heavens: it is 1 the realm of Christianity, 2 the church, and 3 the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here it refers to the second.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This does not mean that to enter into the kingdom of the heavens one must be a child physically; it means that one must become like such.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The actual child is only used as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, Nicodemus could not have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One who is not regenerated cannot understand the matter of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Become like little children."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means to be selfless, dependent, and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 4:"He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 3 deals with the problem of entering in. Verse 4 deals with the problem of being great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After regeneration, if a person remains humble and always like a little child, this one is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unfortunately, the conditions are here, yet most men reject them and do not care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are some infants who act too much like an adult.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They think that they have been pastors for sixty years or have been elders for twenty years, yet in reality they are still infants 1 Cor 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Become like little children" is the condition for entering into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If one can always keep this condition, he will become great.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord was paying the temple tax, He was humble like a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is right for believers to progress in knowledge and to teach and help other people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The humility here refers to the attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One should have a humble attitude like a little child who does not look at himself and who does not try to compare himself with others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The worst thing is to compare in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul considered himself the least of the apostles 1 Cor 15:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not come to this conclusion by comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the salvation of Israel, he would rather be separated from Christ Rom 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was altogether selfless, not looking at himself; he was the best child.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul ran the race and did not look at Peter or John; he cared only for the things that were before that he might gain the prize from above not from below Phil 3:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be humble is to be without pride.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not mean that one should not conduct revival meetings or preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even a little child can have pride.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is only when one is humble and "becomes" a little child that he can be without pride.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"He who humbles himself shall be exalted" Luke 18:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 5:"And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Because of My name" is deeper than "for my sake."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To receive "one such little child" is to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With him there is the glory and honor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, to receive him is to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The saints should love not only Christ but all the saints as well see Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>5 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, he who humbles himself should at the same time regard others highly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Verse 6:"And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe in Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In dealing with people, a believer either receives them or stumbles them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To cause others to stumble is worse spiritually than to become a murderer in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A person who stumbles others shakes their faith in Christ and affords them the opportunity to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ paid the temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the one hand, He was humble, and on the other hand, He did not want to offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a person does not want to offend others, he must be humble and must lower himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 7:"Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There are many offenses in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"Woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes," especially if he is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although he will not lose eternal life, he will suffer much loss in the millennium.</S>
