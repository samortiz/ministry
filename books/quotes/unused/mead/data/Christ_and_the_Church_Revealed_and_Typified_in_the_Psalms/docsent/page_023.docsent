   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FROM THE LAW TO CHRIST AND THE HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must go on.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The main point of the first book, Psalms 1 41, is that God's intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that by now we have all turned to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have covered twenty-four Psalms already; now in this chapter we will cover the remaining seventeen Psalms of the first book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us look specifically at Psalms 25 to 41.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The main purpose here is to show how the saints experience and enjoy God through Christ, especially in the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The subject of the first Psalm is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But immediately in the second Psalm, the subject is changed from the law to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Beginning with Psalm 2 we have seen six Psalms of Christ, ending with Psalm 24.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But however much we appreciate the preciousness of Christ, we must realize that Christ is not the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is for the house; Christ is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 16, when Peter saw Christ by the Father's revelation, the Lord immediately directed his attention to the church: "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church" v. 18 . Here in the Psalms we firstly have the law, according to the human, natural, religious concept of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But God turned the saints to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we have Christ revealed, portrayed, and detailed in Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23 and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must repeat again and again these Psalms about the preciousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in this section, from Psalm 2 to Psalm 24, we have very little mentioned of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Indeed, the house is mentioned in these Psalms see 5:7, 11:4, and 18:6 , but it is not emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These few references to the house speak only of such matters as coming into His house, praising God in His temple, and prayer being heard in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But following Psalm 24, from Psalms 25 to 41, the house is set forth in a richer way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In all these seventeen Psalms, Christ is not often mentioned, but the house is repeatedly emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The main thing in this section is the house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is reference after reference to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, the house, the house, for the enjoyment of God!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is in this section that the wonderful verse is found, "O taste and see that the Lord is good" 34:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But where may we taste Him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the house!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can only taste God in His house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Psalm 1 the law is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But immediately the Spirit changes the subject to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, from Psalms 2 to 24, Christ is richly and strongly presented.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet, even in these Psalms, the law is still not absolutely abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when we come to Psalms 25 to 41, it is rather difficult to find a single verse concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I cannot find one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The law is in Psalm 1, but in Psalms 2 to 24 Christ becomes the main figure, and the law is on its way out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then, in Psalms 25 to 41, the law is over, and the house of God becomes the main figure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have turned from the law to Christ, and Christ has brought us to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, the house!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah for God's house!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalms 25 to 41 show us how the saints experience and enjoy God through Christ, especially in the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In these Psalms the sufferings of the saints are identical to the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are a number of verses which indicate the various aspects of Christ's suffering and His attitude in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His life was spent with grief; He was a reproach among the people; He was slandered and threatened; and the people took counsel together against Him and devised to take away His life Psa 31:10-13, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Isa 53:3; John 7:44; 8:59; 11:56-57; Matt 26:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The wicked watched Him and sought to slay Him Psa 37:32, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Luke 11:54 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He trusted in God Psa 31:14, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Heb 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His times were in God's hand Psa 31:15, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John 7:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He committed His spirit into God's hand Psa 31:5, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these verses in the Psalms are the words of the suffering saints, but their sufferings were identical to the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In these Psalms there are also several prophecies concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He considered Himself as a sacrifice and an offering to God, and He delighted to do the will of God Psa 40:6-8, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Heb 10:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The people hated Him without a cause Psa 35:19, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>John 15:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One of His disciples betrayed Him Psa 41:9, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John 13:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not one of His bones were broken Psa 34:20, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>John 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these are prophecies of His suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These Psalms also indicate how, through Christ, the saints experience and enjoy God as their light, their salvation, their strength, and their shield Psa 27:1; 28:7 , and they taste God Himself Psa 34:8 .</S>
