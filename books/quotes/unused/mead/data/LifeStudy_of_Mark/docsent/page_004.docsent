   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE TWO A WORD OF INTRODUCTION 2 Scripture Reading: Isa 42:1-4, 6-7; 49:5-7; 50:4-7; 52:13 53:12; Mark 10:45</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This message is a continuation of the introductory word in our Life-study of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that this Gospel portrays the excellency of Christ s virtues in His humanity as a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospel of John presents Christ as the God-Savior, the Gospel of Matthew presents Him as the King-Savior, and the Gospel of Luke presents Him as the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Gospel of Mark presents Christ as the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the subject of this Gospel is the Slave of God as the Slave-Savior of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First we shall see the Lord as a Slave of God and then as the Slave-Savior of sinners 10:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A SLAVE OF GOD As Prophesied in Isaiah</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we shall concentrate on Isaiah s prophecy concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s Choice and His Delight</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaiah 42:1 says, Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus Christ, the Slave of God, was God s choice from among billions of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because He was God s choice, God delighted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, He became the delight of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Growing Up before God as a Tender Plant</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah 53:2 and 3 say, For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you read chapter two of the Gospel of Luke, you will see Christ growing up like a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised province of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was the fulfillment of the dry ground in Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord had no form or comeliness, no physical beauty, that He should be desired.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, who was acquainted with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s life was a life of sorrows and of grief.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His Visage Marred More Than Any Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning the Lord Jesus, Isaiah 52:14 prophesies, As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the Lord s appearance, His countenance, was marred.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word marred is a strong word and indicates that the Lord s visage was somewhat damaged or disfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many years ago a certain artist painted a portrait in which the Lord is depicted as a handsome man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That portrayal is altogether false.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, a great many Christians have a copy of that portrait in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While I was traveling in central China in 1936 doing the work of preaching the gospel, I encountered a case of demon possession related to this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A young woman had become demon possessed, and those who were trying to help her referred the case to me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I told them that, for the most part, demon possession is due to the worship of idols, and I asked if there were any idols in her home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They told me that there were no idols.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, there was a copy of that well-known picture of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I told them that the picture was an idol and that they should take it down and burn it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the portrait was burned, the demon left that young woman.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have such a picture of Jesus is altogether contrary to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My purpose in relating this story is to point out this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the Bible, the Lord Jesus did not have a handsome face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, His visage was marred, disfigured.</S>
