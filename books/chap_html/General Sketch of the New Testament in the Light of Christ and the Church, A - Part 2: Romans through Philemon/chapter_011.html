<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>SANCTIFICATION, GLORIFICATION, SELECTION, AND THE BODY LIFE IN ROMANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:6, 4, 14, 28-30, 32, 35, 38-39; 9:16; 11:5; 12:1-2, 11, 4-5</h1><h2 class=head1>SANCTIFICATION</h2><h2 class=head2>Three Parties with Three Wills, Three Lives, and Three Laws</h2><p>As we saw in the previous chapter, Romans 7 and 8 speak of three lives and four laws. The law of God, that is, the law of letters, is outside of man, demanding us to do good and to do the will of God according to what God is. The other three laws are within us subjectively. In each part of man as a tripartite being there is a law. In our body is the law of sin, in our soul is the law of good, and in our spirit is the law of life. Our thought may be that the goal is merely to do good. However, God’s intention for man is not merely that we do good but that we live by His life, that is, by Him as life.<p>We must remember well that in this universe there are three parties—God, Satan, and man. With these three parties there are three wills—the divine will of God, the devilish will of Satan, and the human will of man. From the Scriptures it is easy to realize that the devilish will is always struggling to frustrate the divine will; Satan’s will always tries to damage and hinder God’s will. Therefore, in the universe there is a battle raging. Even science tells us that there is something contradictory in the universe, like a battle, a warfare. This is because there are two wills—the divine will and the satanic will—contradicting one another and fighting against one another.<p>In addition, God created a third will, that is, the human will. God created this will with the intention that this will would stand with Him. However, God did not force the human will to stand with Him; God gave man a free choice, his own volition. Therefore, this will can choose either side. If man so desires, he can choose God. However, if he likes, he can also choose to stand with Satan. If man chooses God and stands with God’s will, God can then accomplish His purpose. However, if man chooses to stand with Satan, then Satan can do something to frustrate God’s will. Therefore, there are three parties and three wills.<p>With each will there is a particular life. Just as there is the divine life with the divine will and the satanic life with the devilish will, there is the human life with the human will. Moreover, with each life there is an accompanying law. We do not say that a life is a law; rather, with any kind of life there is a law. According to biologists, it is a scientific fact that with any kind of physical life, there are principles and laws. With the divine life there is also the divine law, with the satanic life there is the satanic law, and with the human life there is the human law. In short, there are three wills with their respective lives, and each of these lives has its own law. Always remember these three things.
