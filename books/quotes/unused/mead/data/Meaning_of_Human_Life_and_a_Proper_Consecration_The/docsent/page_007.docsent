   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meaning of human life is the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although there are other planets in our solar system besides the earth, no human beings or organisms have been found on other planets.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scientists are still looking for life on other planets.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the Bible, the place where God put life is earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The earth is the center of God s attention because man, who was created by God, is on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the center, the focus, of the universe is man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there were no human beings on earth, the earth would have absolutely no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The lions and the tigers are powerful, but they are unable to accomplish anything meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything that is meaningful on the earth is accomplished by man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man is the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The meaning of human life is the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On a smaller scale let us use Taiwan as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Taiwan would have no meaning if no one were living on it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Taipei would have no meaning if no one were living in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A school would have no meaning if there were no students in it, and of course, a family would have no meaning if there was not even one person in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOD ENTERING INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The meaning of the universe is the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The meaning of the universe is centered on man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that if human life is void of meaning, the universe is also void of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason we must know the meaning of human life, which is God entering into man so that He may be expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The meaning of human life is for man to express God and to represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not express or represent God, our human life is void of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some young people feel that as long as they study, their future is secure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, what will they do after they finish their studies?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some young people may say that they will make money.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Money is not a good thing; it is an evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The young people need to consider what they will do with the money they make.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Will they spend it on eating, drinking, and being merry, as the rich man did in Luke 12:19?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If this is their intention, they are studying in order to become slaves to eating, drinking, and being merry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are getting a college education in order to make money so that they can eat, drink, and be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that they will become slaves to eating, drinking, and being merry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Higher the Education,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>the Stronger the Sense of Emptiness</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Within every person there is a sense of vanity and emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While they are in school, they feel empty, and when they begin working, they still feel empty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe that every young person has had this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you were in elementary school, you studied diligently, and your parents supported you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You might have felt that entering junior high school was an achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you continued to study in order to enter high school.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you were in high school, you probably began to feel a sense of vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You continued to study diligently in order to finish high school and enter a university.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you entered the university, the sense of vanity within you might have deepened.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before entering the university, you thought that passing the entrance examination was something wonderful; hence, you worked hard.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After you achieved this goal, you felt only vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this time onward, young people experience the vanity of human life again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After graduating, some young people continue with graduate school and earn a master s degree or even become a doctor of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have met many people with a Ph.D. who told me that their degree gave them a sense of vanity, of emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If they did not have their degree, they would not feel as empty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they obtained their degree, their sense of emptiness increased.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more education a person receives, the emptier he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, when he graduates from the university and begins to work, the sense of emptiness within him becomes stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Marriage and Careers</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Being Unable to Satisfy Man</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some young people look forward to getting married.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They think that once they are married, they will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They do not know that every married person says that marriage is vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people wonder why they are married.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What can they do when they are married?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They can do nothing but taste emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is the same with those who are successful in their careers and become wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The higher their position, the emptier they feel, and the more money they make, the emptier they feel.</S>
