First, they can move by flying because they have the wings of an eagle. They can also move by walking on the calf&rsquo;s hoofs. These two ways of moving are an ordinary move. But when they need to move in a special way, they move by a wheel.</p><p>On your job you need to move daily by the eagle&rsquo;s wings and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs. If you move in this way, your co-workers will see that with you there is something powerful. You can suffer things which others cannot suffer and you can endure things which others cannot endure because you have the eagle&rsquo;s wings. They can also realize that in your character and behavior you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness. They will see the eagle&rsquo;s wings and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs upon you, and thus they will be convicted by you in their conscience.</p><p>In addition to this kind of move with you on your job, there should also be another kind of move&mdash;an extraordinary move, the move of a wheel. Eventually, because the move of the wheel is with you, some of your co-workers may be gained by the Lord.</p><p>If you should work at a job for several years and nothing happens for the Lord&rsquo;s interests, this indicates that with you there is no move of the Lord. You may consider yourself spiritual and heavenly, but you are lacking the wheel. If there is no move of the Lord with you, it is questionable whether you have the eagle&rsquo;s wings, the man&rsquo;s hands, and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs. This may indicate that while you are at work, you are somewhat worldly and that you are not a proper human being; therefore, the move of the Lord is not with you. But if you have the eagle&rsquo;s wings, the man&rsquo;s hands, and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs, there will surely be a wheel beside you. The move of the Lord will be with you.</p><p>Wherever we go, there should be a high and dreadful wheel by us. If we move to a certain city, there should be a wheel in that city. If we move to a particular country, there should be a wheel in that country. The presence of the wheel will prove that we are proper, that is, that we have the eagle&rsquo;s wings, the man&rsquo;s hands, and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs. As we have pointed out, if we do not have the eagle&rsquo;s wings, the man&rsquo;s hands, and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs, we are not qualified to have a wheel standing beside us.</p><p>If we would have the wheel, we need to be the proper living creatures. This means that we need to experience the blowing of the wind, the overshadowing of the Spirit, and the burning of the Spirit in order to gain much electrum. We also need to have the four faces expressing Christ in an adequate way and the eagle&rsquo;s wings by which we can move and behave in a divine way. Furthermore, we need the calf&rsquo;s hoofs in order to walk in a straight and sincere way, in a way that convinces others and commends us to their conscience. If this is our situation, then certainly there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us. This wheel is the move of the Lord.</p><p>Consider the apostle Paul. By reading his Epistles and the book of Acts, we can realize that Paul regarded himself as less than the least of all saints (Eph. 3:8). Even his name, Paul, means &ldquo;little.&rdquo; Paul was a little man, yet with him there were the eagle&rsquo;s wings, the man&rsquo;s hands, and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs. Thus, wherever he went, there was a great, high, and dreadful wheel. The situation should be the same with us today. We should have the eagle&rsquo;s wings, the man&rsquo;s hands, and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs, and thereby have a great wheel for the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Ezekiel &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
