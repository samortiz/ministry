<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. TWO PRINCIPLES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Two Ways Constituting the Two Principles</H2><P>The two ways, the way of life and the way of death and of good and evil, constitute the two controlling, ruling, and regulating principles by which men have their relationship with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Principle Being the Principle of Life</H2><P>The first principle is the principle of life, according to which all men in the way of life keep their contact with God, and by which they seek God, gain God, possess God, and enjoy God, step by step, until they reach the fullest extent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Principle<br>Being the Principle of Death and of Good and Evil</H2><P>The second principle is the principle of death and of good and evil, in which all men in the way of death follow Satan either consciously or unconsciously, and through which they reject God and His way of life to be Satan's companions unto death and eternal perdition.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Purpose in Dealing with Job Severely</H2><P>God's purpose in dealing with Job severely was to adjust his logic concerning his relationship with God from the principle of good and evil according to ethics to the principle of life according to God, that he might be one who gained God and participated in God for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy.</P>
