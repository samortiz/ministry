<h2 class="head1">THE GIFTS GIVEN BY THE HEAD<br />
WHO FILLS ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>After Christ&rsquo;s ascension, He gave many gifts to the church. These gifts are a group of people. They are the gifted persons. Among them there are some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. These are people such as Peter and Paul. They were formerly fallen sinners and sons of Adam, captives who were captured, dominated, and bound by Satan. In spite of their struggling, they had no way of escape. Then one day the Triune God became flesh and entered into these hopeless ones. He even became one of these hopeless ones and was made one with them. He lived in such a hopeless man for thirty-three and a half years and brought this hopeless man to the cross, terminating the hopeless one. Then He destroyed Satan on the cross and crushed the Devil, even Satan, who has the power of death. After this, He captured these ones from the hands of Satan, and in His resurrection, He resurrected them all and uplifted and transformed these fallen ones. In His ascension, He led these captives to the heavens and offered them to the Father. The Father gave these captives as gifts to the ascended Head who, in His position of ascension, gave in turn these gifts to the church.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the Lord gave these people as gifts to the Body, the church. The leading one among them was Peter. From that day on, gifts have been given to the church continually. One of these gifts was Saul of Tarsus. Formerly, he was one who was against God, against the Lord Jesus, persecuting the churches, and murdering the saints. While he was on the way to Damascus to persecute the saints, the Lord, who captured him out of the hand of Satan, appeared to him. Immediately he fell to the ground, and he heard a voice that spoke to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting&rdquo; (Acts 9:4b-5). Saul thought that Jesus was in the grave; he never imagined that Jesus was in heaven. He thought that he was persecuting men on earth; he never realized that he was persecuting the Lord in heaven. That day Paul was saved. Later the Lord led him away to a quiet place and showed him the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It became the content of his fourteen Epistles, which are the deepest books of the New Testament. Tonight we read a portion from Ephesians chapter four. Had it not been for Paul&rsquo;s seeing, and his writing it down in the Bible, no one would have ever known this matter concerning the ascended Head giving the gifts. Without the revelation and exposition from the Lord, we would not be able to understand this portion even if we were to read it more than a thousand times. The reason for this is that these words are deep words in God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, died on the cross, entered into Hades, and resurrected from the dead. Through this process of descending and ascending, He captured us, the captives of Satan. He put His life into us to regenerate us, and He put His nature into us that our humanity would be uplifted and transformed.</p>
<p>I believe that whether you have been saved for a long time or a short time, you will discover that you are transformed and have been uplifted higher than before. This does not mean an outward uplifting; rather, it means an uplifting in the inward nature. This uplifting in nature grows higher and higher day by day until we become the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL BELIEVERS CAN BECOME THE APOSTLES,<br />
THE PROPHETS, THE EVANGELISTS,<br />
THE SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</h2>
<p>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus and have been saved, many of us have preached the gospel to others. After we preached the gospel, we began shepherding and teaching in the home meetings and group meetings. If we have ever begotten, nourished, and taught, we are the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers. A prophet in the sense of the original Greek language is a spokesman of the Lord. He is one who speaks for God, speaks forth God, and speaks and supplies God into men. Everyone who speaks for the Lord in this way is a prophet.</p>
<p>I came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in 1932. We have been studying this matter of the apostles for over fifty years to find out who are the apostles and what are their qualifications and status. I received tremendous help from Brother Watchman Nee. Based on our further study the last thirty or so years, we can now say that the light is very clear. Last week at the elders and co-workers&rsquo; training, my first message covered the basic qualifications of an apostle: first, he must have the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church (Matt. 16:16-18; Gal. 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph. 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32); second, he must be able to preach the gospel of Christ and lead the chosen and called sinners to Him (Gal. 1:16a; Eph. 3:8; 2 Cor. 11:2); third, he must be able to raise up local churches and to appoint elders to lead, shepherd, teach, and oversee these churches (Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:2); fourth, he must be able to define doctrines, open up the truth, perfect the saints, and build up the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 2:7; Eph. 4:11-12). These four items are the works that an apostle should do. They are also his qualifications to be an apostle.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have the possibility of becoming an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, or a shepherd and teacher. This is the reason why we felt that we must change the system during the past four years. In the old system, we listened to messages week after week. Yet in the end, we were still unable to be the apostles, prophets, shepherds and teachers. We were not even able to preach the gospel. When we tried to help a friend or a relative to be saved, we had to bring him to the gospel meeting to listen to a gospel message. Others had to preach the gospel for us. This was the damage of the old system. I am so happy that since we began practicing the new system last November, many have learned to preach the gospel, to shepherd, and to prophesy. I hope that in two or three years, many of you will become apostles. There is much hope for this.</p>
