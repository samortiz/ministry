<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(6) Realizing that God Had Shepherded Him<br>All His Life Long</H2><P>In 48:15 Jacob spoke of God as the One who "shepherded me all my life long unto this day" (Heb.). I hope that all of us will be able to say at the time of our departure that our life was under God's shepherding. May we be able to say, "I was not a sheep without a Shepherd. The Lord has been my Shepherd my whole life long. Now as I am about to die, I am still under His shepherding. I do not choose my own way. He is leading me, and I am under His shepherding."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(7) Prophesying concerning His Twelve Sons</H2><P>As Jacob was dying, he prophesied concerning his twelve sons (49:1-2). Jacob did not prophesy by saying, "Thus saith the Lord." Rather, he prophesied by being one with God to speak for God. Whatever Jacob spoke became God's word. Jacob was God's mouthpiece. This is the kind of prophecy we find in the New Testament. For example, in 1 Corinthians 7 Paul said that he had no commandment of the Lord, yet he would give his opinion as one who had received the mercy of the Lord to be faithful. Nevertheless, what he spoke was the word of God, for Paul was absolutely one with God, and what he said was God's word. The fact that Jacob could prophesy in such a way was a strong sign and manifestation that he was matured in life. Because he had become one with God, he was mature in life. Therefore, whatever he uttered was God's speaking. He did not claim that God told him to say certain things; neither did he declare, "Thus saith the Lord." He simply spoke, and whatever he said was God's word. God honored it and fulfilled it. God has certainly fulfilled the prophetic blessing pronounced by Jacob upon his twelve sons. This proves that he departed in the maturity of life. His departure reveals his maturity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(8) Buried with High Honor</H2><P>In 50:1-13 we have the record of Jacob's burial, which was more grand than a state funeral. When Joseph went to bury his father, "with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt...And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company" (50:7, 9). This indicates that Jacob was buried in a stately manner, full of honor. Because Jacob was full of hope, expecting to be resurrected, he charged his son Joseph to carry out his burial in a way corresponding to God's promise. Only unbelievers, those who have no faith in God, neglect the matter of their burial. If we have faith in resurrection, we should make a good arrangement for our burial, an arrangement that will show others that we are not without hope. We expect to be resurrected in a glorious manner to meet the Lord.</P><P>The departure of the Apostle Paul was triumphant. However, the departure of Paul was that of a martyr, whereas that of Jacob was normal. Martyrdom does not reveal the normal departure of a man who loved God. We see such a normal departure in the record of Jacob. For this reason, although I appreciate the departure of Paul as a martyr, I love Jacob's departure more because it provides a picture of a normal departure of one of God's children. Regarding Jacob's departure, there is nothing sad or unpleasant. On the contrary, everything is encouraging and edifying. Whenever I read these chapters describing Jacob's departure, I am edified and say, "Lord, grant me the grace never to fear death. When death comes under Your arrangement, I want to take it just as Jacob did." This attitude, however, requires the maturity in life. Jacob, who had become Israel, was mature in life. Therefore, he could depart in such an excellent way.</P>
