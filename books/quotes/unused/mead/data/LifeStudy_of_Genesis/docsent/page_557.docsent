   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-NINE BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY 4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to 49:8-15, the most difficult section of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to understand these verses, we need a strong spirit and a clear mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As I pointed out in the last message, the twelve sons of Jacob are divided into four groups of three.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not according to my opinion; it is absolutely according to the arrangement of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The books of Moses reveal that the twelve sons of Jacob are arranged in three different orders: the order according to birth, the order according to blessing, and the order according to encampment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us first consider the order according to birth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jacob's twelve sons were born of four mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first was Leah, Jacob's proper wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first four sons, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, were born of Leah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second mother was a maid named Bilhah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jacob's fifth son, Dan, and his sixth, Naphtali, were born of her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob's seventh and eighth sons, Gad and Asher, were born of another maid, Zilpah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ninth and the tenth, Issachar and Zebulun, were also born of Leah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Finally, Joseph, the eleventh, and Benjamin, the twelfth, were born of Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the order according to birth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the order according to blessing, the first three sons are Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, the same as in the order according to birth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are followed by Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the first two groups in the order according to blessing include the six sons born of Leah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in the order according to birth Issachar precedes Zebulun, but in the order according to blessing Zebulun comes before Issachar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The third group includes Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to birth, the order was Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, but according to blessing, it is Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later we shall see that Gad was moved from this group and replaced Levi in the group with Reuben for encamping.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fourth group is composed of the sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin, the same according to blessing as according to birth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the encampment, Joseph became two tribes through Ephraim and Manasseh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the book of Numbers we see the order according to encampment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This book reveals that the twelve tribes of Israel were encamped around the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time, they were armies, and they camped as armies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The arrangement of the tribes around the tabernacle went from the east, to the south, to the west, and then to the north.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the encamping order, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were on the east, toward the sun; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad on the south; Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin on the west; and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali on the north.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gad was placed with Reuben and Simeon because Levi had been uplifted and taken into the tabernacle, the center of the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin were the equivalent of Joseph and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph became two tribes to inherit the double portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the foregoing message we considered the first group in the order according to blessing in Genesis 49: Reuben, Simeon, and Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In that message we saw mainly the changing of the birthright and the transformation of the natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The outstanding feature of the first group is that it reveals that our natural status and disposition can be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this message we come to the second group, composed of Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 8 through 15 are very difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to understand chapter forty-nine, we must know the Bible in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, we must know the history of the children of Israel, we must have the experience of Christ and the church life, and we must know how to allegorize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not know how to allegorize the Scriptures and interpret the poetry of the Bible, how could you be able to understand such a portion as Genesis chapter forty-nine?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 9 Judah is likened first to a young lion and then to a lioness, and verse 11 speaks of the choice vine and of binding the foal to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When those who oppose the allegorizing of the Bible read this portion of the Word, they will have no way to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 13 says that Zebulun will be a haven of ships and dwell at the haven of the sea; verse 14, that Issachar is a strong ass couching between the sheepfolds; and verse 15, that Issachar saw that "rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What does all this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because this is so difficult, very few Christians have any understanding of it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The only way to understand it is to allegorize it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, it is not an easy matter to allegorize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to understand such a portion as 49:8-15, we need several things: the knowledge of the Bible in black and white; the knowledge of the history of the children of Israel; the experiences of Christ and the church life; the wisdom to allegorize the Bible; and the knowledge of how to apply the types to today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we have all this, then we shall be able to see the true significance of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible is very economical.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not one word is wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jacob's prophecy with blessing in chapter forty-nine is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Poetry is the most thoughtful and meaningful form of writing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Jacob's utterance of prophecy with blessing is stately and filled with grandeur.</S>
