   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAYING AND READING THE BIBLE IN A PROPER WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must learn to pray and read the Bible in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not a ritual of kneeling down, closing our eyes, and saying, Lord Jesus, I thank and praise You for giving me peace and keeping me from having a car accident.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hallelujah, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not the kind of prayer we are referring to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a prayer is merely from the lips; it is not a prayer in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regrettably, most Christians pray this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes we close our eyes and mumble a few words before a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say that we have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, it is hard to say from where we have prayed, or whether we prayed in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that the Holy Spirit is in us; He is living in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But perhaps some young people among us are not clear concerning their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our spirit is the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose you have an argument with your sister at home; she says that you are wrong, and you say that she is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, as you continue to say that she is wrong and that you are right, in the deepest part of your being there is a sense that you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Outwardly you may be unyielding, but inwardly there is a different feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The feeling in the depth of your being is different from your reasonings and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This feeling in the depth of your being, this other feeling, is the feeling in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, which is our deepest part.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jude 20 says, Praying...in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, every time we pray, we must turn from our outward being to our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our prayer must not be a ritual in which we kneel down to say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank and praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Jesus name, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot pray like this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we pray, we need to stop our person and turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we can pray according to the feeling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is to pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of prayer in the Spirit will cause us to touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must always return to our spirit and pray in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also must read the Word in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every time we read the Bible, we should read it in our spirit and not merely in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not read the Bible in this way, the Bible will be like any other book, which can be understood by reading and reciting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person who reads the book of Genesis in this way can understand that Abraham s son was Isaac, Isaac s son was Jacob, Jacob had twelve sons, and the youngest was Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He can also understand that Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and later God rescued them out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of reading is like reading history.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is useless, because then the Bible is neither the Lord s word nor the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible can be the Lord s word and the Spirit when we pray in our spirit and touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we open the Bible and read it while we are in the Spirit, every word in the Bible will be the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we read the Word in the spirit, the Word will be Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we read the Word in this way, we will pray and give thanks when we pray and read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because we are filled with the Holy Spirit and with the Word, we are also filled with thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This kind of praying and reading of the Bible touches the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not the prayer in which we merely move our lips, nor is it reading the Bible merely with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praying merely with our lips is not effective, nor is reading the Bible merely with our mind effective.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are done outside of the Holy Spirit and cannot help us touch God nor help us eat the Lord and drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would touch the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord, we must pray in the Spirit and read the Bible in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can our praying and our reading of the Word always be in the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we pray, we must be calm and turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then from within our spirit and according to the feeling in our spirit, we can gradually begin to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is how to pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we pray in this way, the more we will breathe in the Holy Spirit and have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will make us persons in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit will bring the word into us, and we will be able to read the Bible in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our reading of the Bible will be in the Holy Spirit, and the words in the Bible will touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, the word will be Spirit to us and will give us life and cause us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not only so, our prayer will be effective, because we will not be the source of the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord in us, the Holy Spirit in us, and the word in us will enable us to pray in the Lord s feeling and according to His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Moreover, whatever we ask, the Lord will do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This kind of reading and praying enable us to touch the Holy Spirit and be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>EATING, DRINKING, AND ENJOYING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>DAILY IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The burden of this message is to point out a way for us to read the Bible and to pray every day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, my burden is that we would eat God, drink God, and enjoy God, that is, that we would touch the Lord s presence and have His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this we must learn to pray in the Holy Spirit and read the Bible in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are not willing to learn, this message will be empty and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, if we are willing to learn, this message can give us a way that will enable us to touch the source of unlimited blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the young people can be brought into this practice, they will be brought into immeasurable blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They will be brought deeper and deeper into God, and God will fill them with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They will also have deeper and richer experiences of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Such a living far surpasses listening to messages, attending meetings, or participating in various kinds of Christian activities.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must all see that to pray in the spirit and to read the Lord s Word in the spirit are precious, practical, and intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I hope that we can all learn to turn to our spirit and pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then the Spirit will bring the word into us, and we will be able to read the Lord s word when we open our Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As we pray in the spirit and read the Word in the spirit, every word of the Bible will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We will have the Lord s presence, His manifestation, and the Lord will make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We will also pray more, which will enable us to touch the Spirit more.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more we touch the Spirit, the more we will have the Lord s word, which brings us more of the Lord s presence and further enables Him to make His abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thus, we will be persons who touch the Lord, eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way, the elements of Christ will gradually increase within us, and the Lord will grow in us daily.</S>
