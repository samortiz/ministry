   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Charging Them with Lamb-feeding</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Sheep-shepherding</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After restoring Peter s love toward Him, the Lord Jesus charged him, saying, Feed My lambs, Shepherd My sheep, and Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first twenty chapters of the Gospel of John stress the matter of believing in the Son that we may have life 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in this chapter it is not a matter of believing but of loving.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fruit-bearing in chapter fifteen is the outflow of the riches of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here the lamb-feeding is the nourishing with the riches of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to feed others we need to enjoy the riches of the Lord s divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This requires that we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To believe in the Lord is to receive Him, and to love the Lord is to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord came as life and as the life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to have faith in Him and love toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Gospel of John, these are the two requirements for participating in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lamb-feeding is by the nourishing with the riches of the inner life, and sheep-shepherding is for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Shepherding is for the flock 10:14, 16 , which is the church Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, it is related to God s building Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, in his first Epistle, Peter indicated this by saying that growth, by feeding on the pure milk of the Word, is for the building of God s house 1 Pet 2:2-5 and by charging the elders to shepherd the flock of God 1 Pet 5:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The growth by nourishing is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord is still working with His disciples in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, by lamb-feeding and sheep-shepherding, the Lord is working with us for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By considering three chapters, John 10, and 1 Peter 2 and 5, we shall see that feeding the lambs and shepherding the sheep are for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to John 10, the Lord laid down His soulish life that His sheep might have His divine life and be brought together as one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To bring all His sheep together as one is truly the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Peter 2, Peter says that we, as newborn babes, must be fed with the pure milk of the Word that we might grow up to be built up together as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, in 1 Peter 5, Peter, as one of the elders, charges the elders to care for the sheep by feeding and shepherding them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Feeding the sheep is different from shepherding them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 21:15 the Lord said, Feed My lambs ; in 21:16, He said, Shepherd My sheep ; and in 21:17, He said, Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To shepherd means to take care of the sheep, and to feed means to supply food to the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we are serving the Lord today, we must not only care for His sheep, but also feed them with spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not sufficient simply to care for and to look after the brothers and sisters; we must also feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 15 the Lord said, Feed My lambs, and in verse 17 He said, Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this we see that both the young believers and the more matured believers need the feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the Lord has committed to us the burden of His flock, we must be sure to do two things to feed them and to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. Walking with the Disciples as His Followers 1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instructing Them to Follow Him to Death</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 21:18-23, we see that the Lord Jesus walks with the disciples as His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After restoring Peter s love for Him and charging him with lamb-feeding and sheep-shepherding, the Lord, by predicting Peter s martyrdom, instructed the disciples to follow Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 18 the Lord said to Peter, Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In saying this to Peter, the Lord was signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, in 2 Peter 1:14, Peter referred to this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here in this chapter the Lord was preparing Peter to follow Him to death, but not by anything of himself nor according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord seemed to be saying, Peter, you did not keep your word, but I will keep My word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You said that you would even die for Me, but you did not keep your word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day you will die for Me, for you will die to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While you are young, you will be free.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the day will come when you are old.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then people will catch you, bind you, and bring you to a place where you do not want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After hearing these words, Peter realized that he would be martyred for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time, Peter did not say either yes or no.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After predicting Peter s martyrdom, the Lord said to him, Follow Me!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all must follow the Lord as the indwelling One.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Me whom we are to follow is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As verse 18 indicates, we must not follow the Lord by our own will but according to His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our following Him even unto death is to glorify God v. 19 . Furthermore, we must follow Him without paying attention to others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After the Lord told Peter to follow Him, Peter turned to John and said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man? v. 21 . To this, the Lord replied, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me! v. 22 . The Lord was telling Peter that what would happen to John was none of his business and that he had to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This chapter is a picture showing that after we have been regenerated and commissioned by the Lord, we must love the Lord at any cost and follow Him to the end at any sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By following the Lord in this way, we shall accomplish the Lord s purpose to feed His lambs and to feed and shepherd His sheep.</S>
