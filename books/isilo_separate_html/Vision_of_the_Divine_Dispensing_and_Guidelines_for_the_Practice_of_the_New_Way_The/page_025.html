The primary goals of this training are to perfect a group of young believers to go down to the villages to preach the gospel, to come back to the big cities to learn to serve, and to build up the church. At the same time, we also have the intention that some would go overseas to spread the Lord's recovery, especially in Latin America and Africa. We know that one third of the total population of the world speaks Spanish, and that all of Latin America is under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Most of the other parts of the world use English as the principle language and are primarily under the influence of the Protestant churches. But both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches are far away from the Bible in their form, expression, and content. Most of these churches have become deformed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE</H2><P>In the 1920s, the Bible came into our hands. We received the Bible, not something by word of mouth. This was not a small thing. Moreover, as we consider the riches of theology through the past centuries, we can see that in the first period, before the birth of Christ, these riches were in the Hebrew language. In the second period, after the birth of Christ, they moved from the Hebrew language to the Greek language. Then in the third period, from about 1590 to today, they passed through the Latin language and entered into the English language. Today the riches of all the theological studies throughout the centuries can now be found among the English-speaking world. Beginning from 1920 with Brother Watchman Nee, we have had brothers among us who have read, investigated, and dived into these riches.</P><P>I would take this opportunity to briefly let you know about the process by which the Bible was translated into Chinese. In 1807, a British missionary named Robert Morrison came to China. He began to translate the Bible, and published his translation by 1823. From that time there began to be different translations carried out and completed by various scholars. Some were translated into the classical Chinese style, and some were in the modern language. Then in 1919, the Chinese Union Version was officially published. It was later revised and came to be called the Mandarin Union Version. This was based on an English translation, the 1885 edition of the Revised Version. At the beginning, the translation was carried out by a committee of seven persons. The chief translator among them was Dr. C.W. Mateer, who was also the chairman of the committee. It took approximately twenty years to finish this work. But in less than ten years after its completion, this translation was ranked above all the other translations, and it was commonly adopted by readers of different levels.</P><P>When the Lord raised us up, we were standing on others' shoulders and received further enlightenment. We took the Mandarin Union Version as the standard reference, and we used all the recognized English versions. We also used the other Chinese versions as secondary references. We did this not only for comparison and enlightenment, but also to avoid bias or misjudgment. At the same time, we took advantage of the best Bible expositions and lexicons. In addition to these things, we received light from God. As a result, we published the New Testament Recovery Version in 1985. This translation can be considered a collection of the knowledge of the divine revelation received by all the saints throughout the last two thousand years. Now it is laid before us with the hope that it will carry on what was in the past and will lead us to further developments in the future.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
