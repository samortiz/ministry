   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the second main thing in the living of God's people in the good land, and that is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you come as an Israelite to worship God, you have to bring the produce of the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that the different sorts of produce are types of the different aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have to bring Christ to the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is also a governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we come together, we have to bring Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not bring anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What you need to bring to the meeting must be Christ or some aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not bring your doctrines, your opinions, or your interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, bring something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose a brother brings the debate about predestination to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is that something of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You and I have to learn the lesson strictly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we come to the meeting, what we bring must be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Look at the picture in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the people of Israel came together to worship God, they just brought the produce of the good land of Canaan to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What they offered to God would be the food to God for His satisfaction and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Also, they shared with one another all that they had offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are clear today that all the offerings, all the things offered to God, are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Concerning the offerings, let me give you a summary.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the offerings are classified into two main categories.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One is the offerings of the animal life, and the other is the offerings of the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Israelites offered something of the herd and of the flocks, which are things of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They also offered corn, wheat, wine, and oil, which are things of the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are also two aspects of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first aspect is that His life is likened to the animal life, which typifies the redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever you offer something of the herd or of the flock, that will be slain and the blood will be shed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the shedding of the blood, there is the redeeming Heb 9:22, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With Christ the Lord, His life in the first aspect is a redeeming life, which is typified by the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The other aspect of the Lord's life is the generating life, which is typified by the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, and when it grows up it produces many grains John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means it generates.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why I say the vegetable life is a generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life of Christ, on the one hand, is the redeeming life to redeem us, and on the other hand, is the generating life to generate much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our experiences of Christ can be classified into these two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ as the redeeming life recovers, heals, cures, and restores us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then there are many other times when we experience Christ as the generating life that generates us, resurrects us, gives life to us, energizes us, strengthens us, and empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The life of Christ is a powerful life that strengthens and energizes us that through us something may be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, in our experience of Christ we should have many flocks and herds and also much wine, oil, corn, and wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the saints bring all these experiences of Christ to the meeting and offer them to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a certain sense, these experiences may be considered as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The burnt offering is something offered to God for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There were five main offerings in the Old Testament the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ as the burnt offering is for the satisfaction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Also, what we bring to God may be considered as a heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To heave means to lift up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the heave offering typifies the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ, who has accomplished everything, is the ascended One, the lifted-up One.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, as the burnt offering, Christ is the very satisfaction to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, as the heave offering, Christ is the ascended One who has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever we come to the meeting, we have to bring these kinds of experiences of Christ.</S>
