We cannot see any unit that is bigger or smaller than the local church. The local church is the biggest as well as the smallest unit. The local church is the one and only institution of Christ. In the Bible all the churches were local. There were the church in Corinth, the church in Ephesus, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, and the church in Philippi. All these churches were named after localities. Although there might have been many meeting places in Jerusalem, there was only one church. Although the meetings might have been held in various places, there was one and only one fellowship. Although there were many divisions in Corinth, they met only in one place. The sphere of the church is based on the boundary of the locality. All the Christians in a locality are in the church in that locality. Therefore, all the believers in Shanghai form the church in Shanghai. God takes the city, the town, or the village as the unit for the church. We can only read of "the church in Ephesus"; we cannot read of "such and such church in Ephesus," because "such and such church" is not qualified to be the church of God in Ephesus.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FORMATION OF DENOMINATIONS AND SECTS</h2><p>The church includes all the believers in a locality. However, on the earth today there are many so-called churches that are not based on locality as the unit. They cannot be called the church, because they are not qualified to be considered as a unit of the church. There are at least three thousand such units in the world. In China alone, there are over one hundred such units, and over seventy such units in Shanghai alone. Because they cannot form a unit for the church, they are not qualified to be called the church. Therefore, they are called sects or denominations.</p><p>If I tear my Bible into five parts and give one part to you, can you say that it is the New Testament? No, you can only say that it is a part of the Bible because it cannot represent the entire Bible. If a person's work in a particular locality is not big enough in its representation, it is not big enough to represent the church. The unit of the church is based on the locality. One problem is that man makes the unit of the church smaller than it should be. Another problem is that man makes the unit of the church bigger than it should be. Revelation 2 and 3 speak of seven local churches. The local church is the largest entity in God's eyes. He does not combine several local churches together; they are all separate. Revelation speaks of the seven lampstands which represent the seven churches. There is not one lamp with seven branches, but seven lampstands. The local churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea were no bigger than their respective localities. A local church cannot be subdivided into smaller units, nor can it be united to form bigger units. There were seven churches on the earth, and there were seven lampstands in heaven. In other words the number of local churches on the earth was represented by an equal number in heaven. Every locality has its own administration. The failure of one church cannot be blamed on another church.</p><p>The local church is the unique unit for the church. Having a local church in smaller units is the same as having divisions (cf. 1 Cor. 1:10-12); combining several local churches together is the same as forming a denomination or a council. Divisions and denominations are produced because man will not work according to the practice of the Scriptures.</p><p>Some people try to be our spokesmen, saying that our testimony is "anti-denominational." If this is our only objective, we have betrayed the truth. We are here because we want to do what the apostles did&mdash;establish local churches, not because we are against the denominations. Too many believers today have not seen the work of the apostles. They have not seen that the apostles did not establish their own meetings; rather, they set up local churches in various localities. Once they established a local church, they left the locality. The local churches were not under their hands, nor did the local churches belong to them. Today many are sent by mission boards of certain denominations. After they establish a meeting in a locality, the meeting belongs to that denomination. This is like flying a kite; a string is attached, and the kite moves by a pull of the string.</p><p>Last summer I read the biography of Hudson Taylor once again. This is the third time I have read his biography. I received much help from him. The China Inland Mission was a mission, yet the result of its work was China Inland Mission churches. This is not right. In order to avoid offending anyone, I will not mention the name of a brother I once met from the China Inland Mission. In the course of our conversation, I said, "Mr. So-and-so, you are an Englishman. You and your wife have suffered a great deal and have gained quite a few Miao natives. Are you setting up the church in Dali, or are you establishing the China Inland Mission in Dali? Today I do not oppose the China Inland Mission to which you belong. Although I cannot join, I do not oppose it. What I do oppose is the China Inland Mission church which you established. I would not comment on you as an individual. But the work produced by your mission is wrong." He said, "Mr. Nee, I understand what you mean."</p><p>The apostle Paul was sent from Antioch. Suppose he came to Ephesus and set up the Antioch Church in Ephesus. Suppose Peter, who also traveled much, came to Ephesus and saved fifty or one hundred people. Suppose he said, "I will not put my people in Paul's Antioch Church. That church is not related to me. I am from Jerusalem, and I will call my church the Jerusalem Church in Ephesus." Suppose Barnabas and Philip also arrived, did their own work, and established their own churches. In this way different kinds of work would result in many divisions among the people. God cannot tolerate this kind of situation. Brothers! I can work together with you, but I have to ask you one thing. It is not a matter of cooperation among co-workers but a matter of the result of our work. Where can we place those who are saved?</p><p>We are servants of all but masters of none. The relationship I have with the assembly in Shanghai is the same as the relationship you have with Shanghai. The local assembly exercises complete authority over itself and is absolutely not related to the workers. The Bible only teaches the establishing of local churches; it does not teach the establishing of churches that are based on an organization to which one belongs.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
