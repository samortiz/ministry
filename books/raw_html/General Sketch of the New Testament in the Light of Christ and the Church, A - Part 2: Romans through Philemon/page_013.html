<h2 class=head2>The Secret of Setting Our Mind on the Spirit</h2><p>Satan dwells in the members of our body, but God is in our spirit. This brings us to Romans 8:6. This verse contains a real secret. In this verse there are three things: the mind, the flesh, and the spirit. It says, “For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.” I have studied many translations of this verse, and this is the one that is the most correct according to the meaning of the original Greek. The translations in the New American Standard Bible and the Revised Standard Version are also good and convey the same meaning.<p>In this verse we again see the three parties. We human beings are represented by the mind, and Satan, the evil one, is in the flesh. The spirit here is the mingling of two spirits—the divine Spirit and the human spirit. It is rather difficult to tell whether spirit in Romans 8 is the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. In verse 6 it refers to the two spirits mingled as one. This can be proved by verse 16 which says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.” Therefore, in the spirit there is God, the divine One, in the mind there is man, and in the flesh there is Satan.<p>Now our experience depends on whom or what we would set ourselves, that is, our mind. If we set our mind on the flesh, that is, on Satan, the issue is death. Adam did this when he partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, with the same result of death. However, if we set our mind on God as life, the result is life and peace. As Christians today there is no need for us to try to overcome the flesh, and there is no need to try to defeat the law of sin; we cannot do that. What we need to do is simply stand with the Spirit and rely upon Him. What we need is the deliverance in the spirit. We must stand with the spirit, set our mind on the spirit, and rely upon the Lord. Then we will be delivered.<p>This is the secret that we all must learn. After being a Christian for many years, I believe that no other teachings are so necessary as this teaching. Of course, the teachings concerning the Lord Himself, who the Lord is, what the Lord is, and what the Lord has done for us are very necessary. Subjectively speaking, however, the teaching of Romans 8:6 is the most necessary. We may illustrate this with driving a car. There are many things involved with driving a car, but the most important thing is to be aware of what is immediately around us. If we know this, we can drive enjoyably and without effort. There is no need to push or pull the car, and there is no need for us to run, walk, or use much energy. We simply can sit there and enjoy our driving, because it is not we who are running, but the car.<p>However, we must learn the secret of cooperating with the car. Whether or not the car runs depends on us. Today we have the “car,” but we must know how to “drive” it. If we know how, there is no problem, and there is no need of our energy. Thirty-five years ago I was still struggling, but praise Him, today I have no struggle! I know that my spirit is my “car,” and I know how to “drive” it. Today, even a person who is crippled can drive a car, because it is not he who carries the car but the car that carries him. However, the car needs him to drive it. In the same way, it is not we who defeat the enemy; it is the divine life that carries us to gain the victory, but the divine life needs us to “drive” it.<p>The secret is not found even in Romans 6:6 or 6:11; the secret is found in Romans 8:6. We must learn how to set our mind on the spirit. In other words, we must learn to trust in God and depend on the Lord. If we know how to rely on the Lord and trust in Him, and if we do it, everything will be all right. This can be illustrated by the use of electric appliances. All we have to know is how to plug them in. There is no trouble unless we do not plug them in; in that case, no one can help us. If we desire and know how to handle the appliances, then we can plug them in whenever we need them. This is simple, yet it is a secret that we all must learn.<p>I stress these matters because I do not have the burden to give you mere doctrine. If there is a need for us to learn doctrine, it is solely for the purpose to “drive the car.” Our knowledge and understanding of the construction of a car and the arrangement of its parts is for one purpose—to drive it. To be familiar with the parts of the car and the operation of the engine helps, but that is not the secret. The secret is the driving. Similarly, although we must study the Bible with its narratives and instructions, the real secret is in Romans 8:6. We may be very knowledgeable of the Scriptures, but if we do not apply Romans 8:6, whatever we know and do will accomplish little.<p>Day and night for many years I have been studying the Bible. I have not found another verse as important as Romans 8:6 as far as our spiritual experience is concerned. The way to “drive” in our spiritual experience is in this verse. Now that I have presented many things to you from Romans, beginning from chapter one up to chapter eight, we come to 8:6. This is the very place and the secret for us to know how to “drive the car.”<p>Within us there are three wills, three lives, and three laws. We ourselves are here, Satan is in us, and God is in us. Now we must pray, “Lord, help me to choose You. Help me to rely on You, depend on You, and drop my effort and striving. Help me never to do anything by myself to overcome evil or temptation. Rather, help me always to rely on You, stand with You, and trust in You. Lord, I would never do anything to try to correct myself or deliver myself. Lord, help me always to thrust myself upon You, trust in You, and depend on You.”<p>Such an experience of depending on the Lord is sweet and very available. Its availability may be compared to the electricity in homes. In our homes electricity is so available. Likewise, we should “plug” into the Lord right away, because He is so available. Just as electricity is installed in a house,  even in the innermost and hidden chambers of the house, the Lord has been installed in our innermost part. Although this divine electricity is so available, there is one thing that is needed: We need to learn the secret and pray that the Lord would give us the willingness to apply it. We always must be willing to apply it and “plug ourselves in.” Although we may listen to hundreds of messages, they may all miss what the real secret of our Christian life is. We have to practice to set our mind on the spirit and to live in this reality all the time.
