According to our experience and the record of the Scriptures, a Christian has eight types of failure, that is, eight types of sin
He cannot bear to see others being more advanced in worldly affairs, and he cannot bear others being more advanced in spiritual matters
If you ask whether or not they believe, they will answer that there is not one word or sentence in God's Word that they do not believe
Martin Luther's wife once put on a funeral dress and told him that he was in such distress that it seemed as if his God had died
Although these are small things, the way in which a person deals with them shows whether or not he lives before God
Adultery is a sin of the flesh undisciplined eyes are a sin of the flesh and improper relationships with others are also a sin of the flesh
There are many Christians who will never experience God's overcoming life unless their eyes are dealt with by the Lord
A wife once said that she knew that she should submit to her husband; however, she always argued a little before submitting
She eventually realized that she has never had any true submission according to the standard of God's commandment
Those who are afraid of consecrating their belongings their material goods and their relationships with others to God have not yet overcome
Many people have dealt with many things, but in their heart they refuse to admit that the things they have dealt with are sins
Not only is there a desiring, there is the loving, the regarding, and the unwillingness to relinquish these sins
You may observe a few flaws in a brother, detect other blemishes in another, and find a few other shortcomings in a third
Every Christian can carry out the will of God, and every Christian can be completely free from his natural affections
When the prodigal son left his father, he wasted everything and longed to be satisfied with the carob pods that the hogs were eating
At that time, our life was filled with hope; we thought that from that point on, all our sins would be under our feet
At the time we were saved, we thought that no temptation was too great for us to overcome and no difficulty was too much for us to surmount
Shortly after they are saved either they consciously suppress their sins or they resign themselves to the thought that victory is impossible
When He was crucified on the cross, did He know that our life would be victorious one day and defeated the next?
Is His blood shed on the cross only sufficient to save us from the coming eternal pain of sin, without saving us from the pain of sin today?
Brothers and sisters, not only did Christ take care of the suffering of hell; He also took care of the suffering of sin
Matthew 1:21 says, 'And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins'
After we are delivered out of the hand of our enemies, is He only interested in our serving Him in holiness and righteousness?
According to the Bible, everyone who is saved by the Lord should serve Him in holiness and righteousness all his days
It does not say that only those who have received special grace from the Lord can have a spring of water gushing up into eternal life
Are we living before God every day in holiness and righteousness, as the priest Zachariah spoke of in Luke 1:75?
On the other hand, one might feel satisfied about something, but as soon as he contacted her, he would find these things to be worthless
The Lord said those who believe into Him will have rivers of living water flowing out of their innermost being
Verse 26 of chapter three says God having raised up His Servant has sent Him to bless you in turning each of you away from your wicked deeds
Verse 3 says, 'Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
One finds himself always having an unforgiving spirit while another is plagued continually by base desires or selfishness
Some find unclean thoughts following them all the time, while others find unclean lusts following them all the time
Brothers and sisters, if we are living a defeated life, we should know that this is not what God ordained for us
About twenty years ago someone discovered some ancient manuscripts and found that there were two meanings to this word
Many brothers are agreeable in some things, but they are provoked as soon as they are stirred up in other things
In our case, we do not need tribulation or swords to come upon us; as soon as someone gives us a bad look, we lose the love of Christ
Whether we encounter tribulation anguish persecution famine nakedness peril or sword we should not only conquer it but more than conquer it!
We are not concerned about these things any longer, and we have more than conquered them because of the love of Christ
Thank and praise the Lord, this should be the experience of a Christian; it is the experience that God has ordained for us
If you encounter a temptation today and you overcome it, you should not be so happy about it that you can hardly sleep at night
It says that we are His masterpiece, created for good works which God has prepared beforehand for us to walk in
Brothers and sisters, are our good works according to God's ordination, or are we always complaining while we are doing good?
While you are mopping, you may complain that only one or two people are helping and that others are not helping
All of us who have not experienced a continual fellowship with the Lord and who have not experienced the sin-crushing power need to overcome
In the Bible, victory is first mentioned in 1 Samuel 15:29 , where it says that Victory will not lie nor repent
The greatest mistake we make today is to think that victory involves progress and that defeat involves the absence of progress
It is not His intention that your evil temper be changed to a good temper or that your stubbornness be changed to meekness
Do you think that if a man is a little more honest, well-tempered, and simple, it is easier for him to overcome?
In the same way, it is not just ill-tempered and immoral ones who need victory; well-tempered and moral ones also need victory
When Fukienese argue, they often use a colloquial expression, si-bu-bien, which means that there cannot be any change until one dies
The latter is given to us freely; it has nothing to do with what we have done, and we do not have to exert any effort to get it
We can look at 1 Corinthians 15:57, which says, 'But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ'
Brothers and sisters, a great mistake is to think that salvation comes to us freely, while victory comes to us as a result of our own effort
While we think that salvation does not require our works, we also think that we should have good works after we are saved
Romans 6:14 is a familiar verse: 'For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace'
Even the brothers in the church were afraid of him because he would disturb the meeting when he lost his temper
He said that during the past twenty hours, he felt as if someone else's wife was sick because he was not worried at all
You may remember that Paul once said, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
The day after she had received the Lord Jesus as her victory, she woke up and came downstairs to the living room
Trumbull and told him of some improper evil influence existing among the board of directors at the place of his work
When he was in the midst of it this time, he was not touched and did not even have an inclination for such sins
Brothers and sisters, many people allow themselves to be unclean within but do not like to be unclean on the outside
Immediately she went to her bed and covered herself with a blanket in an effort to keep from losing her temper
Although he believed in the cleansing of the Lord's blood, he did not know the difference between Christianity and Confucianism
The Confucian way of cultivation is the way of self restraint: it is trying to achieve sainthood through suppression and cultivation
He now testifies that he can let go of himself; he no longer has to suppress himself, and problems no longer arise
Brothers and sisters, the truth concerning crucifixion with Christ on the cross is not being preached for the first time among us
Brothers and sisters, when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, we did not put Him to death, nor did we put ourselves to death
It is also our declaration that we deserve to die and that we ask others to move us out of the way and bury us
Many Christians have forgotten what they did at the time of baptism, and many have forgotten God's valuation of us
We think that we have failed because we are not watchful and that we will be able to stand up to temptation if we are watchful the next time
We think that we have failed because we have not rejected temptation and that we will overcome if we reject the temptation the next time
We think that we have failed this time because we have not prayed enough and that we will overcome if we pray enough the next time
We have to see in this message how we can appropriate the reality of the fact that we have been crucified with Christ
Still you lack one thing all that you have sell and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in the heavens and come follow Me
He thought that he could refrain from adultery, murder, stealing, and bearing false witness and that he could honor his parents
It may be a fondness for eating, or it may be that we cannot get up in the morning before eight or nine o'clock
Every day she wrote letters to others apologizing for her wrongdoings, and every day she went up to the mountain to pray
You may think that you can do something or that you are capable of doing something, but God has to prove to you that you cannot do anything
Brothers and sisters, everyone who wants to overcome must first find out the one thing that he is not capable of doing
Only then will we realize that we are useless, and only then will we realize that the only way to deal with us is death
Otherwise, we would consider it a mistake for God to crucify us, because we would still think that we could do something
He saw that he could not make it, and he asked if there was anyone who could deliver him from the body of this death
Brothers and sisters, the first thing we have to see this afternoon is that according to God's view, we are absolutely useless before Him
There is no doubt that Christ will overcome for you but there is a condition for His overcoming for you You must not consider yourself able
If you continue to say in your heart that you are able and that you can make it in yourself, Christ cannot live for you
The first condition to victory is to realize that we cannot make it, and the second is to give up trying to make it
It is one thing for a person to be unable to make it, and it is another thing for him to give up trying to make it
You try to avoid those with whom you cannot get along well, and you try to talk to those with whom you can get along well
Please remember that the condition of victory is acknowledging that we are unable and the greatest barrier to victory is trying to be able
They think that they are therefore without hope because they cannot distribute all their possessions to the poor
Corinthians 12:9 says, 'He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness
You thank and praise the Lord for giving you patience, but have you thanked and praised Him for your impossible temper?
The mistake of the young man did not lie in his realization of his impossibility but in his failure to realize God's possibility
It is not a sin to have an insurmountable sin, but it is a sin to refuse to believe that God can overcome such a sin for a person
He said that it was something very important and that there was not enough time that evening he needed a long time to talk about his problem
During those three to four years, he had tried seven to eight times every year to quit smoking but could not make it
You should be happy to boast about your weakness because when you are weak, Christ's power will tabernacle over you'
If we want to have the realization that we are crucified with Christ, we must realize that we cannot make it, and we must not try to make it
We are not afraid, and our hearts are filled with thanksgiving and praises because we realize that we are not able in ourselves
During the past few evenings we have seen the kind of life that we live and the kind of life that God requires of us
We will first consider a very important question: How can we enter into the experience of this life and how can we gain Christ?
Paul's letter to the Galatians shows us that he attained, experienced, and entered into the experience of such a life
Corinthians 13:5 says, 'Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved'?
We know that when the Lord was crucified on the cross, He not only took away our sins but also crucified our person
We know that when the Lord died on the cross, He not only bore our sins, but He also crucified our old man together with Him
We have to realize that it is one thing for the Lord Jesus to accomplish salvation and it is another thing for us to receive this salvation
Today many Christians are very familiar with Romans 6, which tells us that our old man has been crucified with Him
The teaching tells us that we are delivered from the bondage of the law, but we say that we are still under the law
We think that before we were saved, we could not improve, correct, or make any headway in ourselves and that we should let go of our past
Now that we are saved, we think that we should try to improve, correct, and make some progress in ourselves in order to please God
One Western sister said that she had promised God more than thirty things, but that she had fulfilled none of these promises
God sees through our condition; He knows that we are completely useless and that there is no further hope in us
It would be well if you could also say that there is no further hope in you and that the only way is to be crucified
Our problem today is that we are very familiar with Romans 6, but we are still making resolutions like the person in Romans 7
If we still cherish some hope and still have a glimmer of faith in ourselves, God will have to continue His work on us
God is leading us to this point because He wants us to realize that we are not able in ourselves, and He wants us to acknowledge this
It is one thing for us to acknowledge that we cannot make it, but it is another thing for us not to try to make it
She admitted that she could not make it, but at the same time, she did not see that she was working and hoping that she could make it
Suppose a sister serves a cup of tea, and while you are picking up the cup, she holds on to it and will not let go
Brothers and sisters, whatever we bring to God when we come before Him must be left with Him when we leave His presence
When you wake up in the morning, Satan may tell you that you are not good, that you are the same in this and that matter
He surrendered on that day, and the next day he told others that he had woken up for the first time without thinking about smoking
Just as a head has a feeling for the body, being responsible for it and ruling over it, Christ is the Head to us
Do we believe that He is our Head, as the Bible says, and that He assumes all of the responsibilities as the Head?
We do not become His branches and He does not become our vine in the near future when our spiritual condition is more advanced
You do not have to try to do anything to join yourself to Him, because God has made you one tree with the Lord already
God has shown us also that the union between the Lord Jesus and us is like the relationship of food to our body
Just as food supplies all our inward needs, and just as we die when we are cut off from this supply, so also is the Lord Jesus to us
In the past, we did not understand this truth, and we tried to build up our own holiness, thereby denying God's holiness
God is inviting us, as well as commanding us, to believe that our union with the Lord is the same as His union with God
They know the utter corruption of their own flesh, but they do not see that God has given the riches of Christ to them as a gift
When we believe that everything that is in Christ is ours, the Holy Spirit will cause all that is in Christ to be ours
They cannot believe that the Lord is living within them, and they cannot believe that the Lord has overcome for them
Brothers and sisters, the way to receive grace to overcome is the same as the way to receive grace for forgiveness
We tell a sinner that Jesus has died for him on the cross and that when he believes, his sins will be forgiven
If someone says something like this you will surely say to him Even if you kneel and pray for a year for joy and peace you will not have it
Brothers and sisters, once we believe in the Lord's Word, the experience will follow, the feeling will follow, and the victory will follow
We have to ask God to show us that His Son has accomplished everything and that we do not have any part in His work
Corinthians 12:9 says, 'And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness
He told the young ruler that in order to inherit eternal life Gods uncreated life through works one would have to take care of these things
When the young man asked the Lord what he should do to inherit eternal life, the Lord told him only five things
The Lord is doing the same thing with regard to the experience of the overcoming life among us today He is applying the same principle to us
Perhaps some sisters or brothers say that they are not as proud as others or not as jealous or stubborn as others
They may think that they are better than others in many things, but God knows that there is one thing in each of us which we cannot overcome
The question today is not how many things we have overcome but whether or not there is one thing that we have not overcome
They may boast that they have not committed this or that kind of sin, but the Lord will still say that they lack one thing
We may want to live a perfect life, but there is one thing which testifies that we have not attained to such a life
Every time she loses her temper, she finds that she has to confess her sin, and after she confesses her sin, she loses her temper again
We have to realize that our many heartbreaks and failures and our many shameful defeats are Gods way of proving to us that we cannot make it
When suppression reaches a certain point, we can suppress these things no longer, and everything goes out of control
Brothers and sisters, what happens when we see the Lord's death for us on the cross, and what happens when we believe?
Similarly, when we see that the Lord has brought us to the cross and crucified us there, we will cease fighting and stop improving ourselves
Once we believe that the Lord is living within us and overcoming for us, we will stop our own work and allow God to rescue us
When temptation comes, they have to put up a fight, and when their temper rises up, they have to wrestle with it
When they resolve to stop doing something and fail, it only means that they make a stronger resolution next time
We are still managing our own affairs, and we cannot say that we are crucified with Christ and that it is no longer we who live
We have to realize that the secret to our victory lies in our standing by; it does not lie in our taking control
What are you going to do when someone continues to agitate you with his words, and the agitation grows increasingly worse?
After this backandforth exchange had been repeated several times you decided to put the money on the ground and say goodbye to your friend
If you want to take control, it will be up to you to suppress your temper and you will have to pick up everything yourself
During the interim period, he would be responsible for half of everything, and the new person would be responsible for the other half
It goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and settle down there'
She said, 'You said that the condition for receiving the overcoming life is first to surrender and second to believe
She answered, 'But didn't you say that the condition for overcoming is first to surrender and second to believe?
Corinthians 12:9 says, 'And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness
On the contrary, it says that we should rejoice over our weaknesses, and we should not just rejoice but also boast in our weaknesses
The whole world mourns for its weaknesses, but the overcomers boast in their weaknesses because they have faith
You have to realize that your problems and failures are a blessing to you; they are there to help you overcome
He had served in the army for over ten years, and his demeanor reflected that of a soldier; he was direct and forthright
Smoking did not pose a major problem to him when he was in Manchuria, but when he came to Chefoo, things became a little more difficult
When he smoked on the street, he first had to look in front and behind to see whether there were any familiar faces
The overcoming life is not an improvement or advancement in ourselves, and it is not a self-effort to strive to become like Christ
We believe that the Son of God lives within us, and we believe that He is living out His victory from within us
In the last meeting, he praised God and proclaimed that for the first time, he had nothing to boast of and that everything was of God
In our January conference of last year, we mentioned three things that God has given us: First, there is the covenant which God has given us
Is it the same whether or not one believes, since Christ has died for all and since this has become God's fact?
Those who believe will have the experience of the juice flowing through them, and they will experience fruit in their work
The Lord's life does not flow through those who do not believe; they have to struggle to work and to bear fruit
If we tell them that the Lord is the vine and we are the branches, they may ask why they cannot work or bear fruit
Is a picture in beautiful green, red, and yellow colors, but the beautiful colors can be substantiated only through the eyes
Different objects have different shapes: some are cubic, while others are spherical, flat, triangular, or curved
It is one thing for objects to exist, and it is another thing for the existence of these things to be substantiated
There are millions of objects on the earth, but all of them are dependent upon a certain ability in order to be substantiated
The scenery is beautiful, and if you have eyes, you can appreciate the beauty of the painting and tell others about it
We need faith to substantiate a spiritual fact just as we need eyes, ears, and hands to substantiate physical objects
The hand substantiates the shape of objects, and the ear perceives sound, but the hand cannot feel nor can the ear hear colors
Brothers and sisters, we may have put ourselves aside and have already realized that we are powerless and useless
When he returned from his daughter's funeral, he considered what the subject of his sermon should be the next day
The problem today is that we have heard that the Lord Jesus is the Head, yet we still pray for Him to be our Head
While he was praying, he recalled the prayer of the leper who prayed to the Lord, saying, 'If You are willing, You can cleanse me'
Even if our wives are dying from sickness, as long as the Lord has said, 'I am willing,' everything will be all right
Believing is not asking for something; it is not asking for God to do something that He has already promised to do
After this, another man stood up and said, 'I have been seeking victory for eleven years but have not overcome
Some people constantly hope that the Lord will save them, and they constantly hope that the Lord will help them overcome
Some people say that they have surrendered and believed, but they are still waiting to see whether it will work
Thank and praise the Lord, the overcoming life is not a matter of us remembering the Lord, but a matter of the Lord remembering us
A sister said that she had surrendered and believed that the Lord was living in her, but she dared not say that she had overcome
The first thing would be to believe the contract and believe that everything mentioned in the contract was his
The second would be to believe my word and believe that since my words were true, the other man's words must be false
God has given us a covenant which says that meekness is ours, patience is ours, and love, temperance, and everything in Christ are ours
God says that Jesus Christ is your sanctification, but you are saying that Jesus Christ may not be your sanctification
God says that His grace is sufficient for you, but you are saying that His grace may not be sufficient for you
Even if we have only one verse of the Scripture or one word from the Lord, we will have the assurance, and we will overcome
Satan will not easily concede that we have believed, and he will not allow us to say that we have obtained what we have believed in
Brothers and sisters, faith that has been tested is much more precious than gold which perishes though it is proved by fire
We know that He supplies us with endurance and meekness, and we know that He is supplying us within with everything that we need
Suppose he went out again and met the same man, who said the same thing again and added, 'I was there when your mother bought you'
Later, when your son went out again, suppose he met the same man again, who asked, 'Have you checked with your mother?
Perhaps the man could name ten or twenty people as witnesses to prove that your son was bought for twenty cents
Should your son listen to your words which do not need any evidence or to the lies of the outsiders which are full of proof?
You are choosing to believe in Satan's lies, which seem to be full of evidence, rather than declaring God's Word
If Satan comes and gives you a feeling that you are cold, you should tell him that you are victorious because Christ is your victory
If we say that we believe with our mouth but are driven back in tears as soon as we are tested, where is our faith?
What is at stake is the fact that when the mountain remains, faith must go, and when faith remains, the mountain must go
If God's word is true, my temperature had to be false, my pulse had to be false, and my insomnia had to be false
True faith is one which believes only in God's Word and not in one's own experience, feeling, or the dark environment
Two brothers and a sister also prayed a few words, but they were not in the flow of the Spirit as much as we were
Brothers and sisters, when the indwelling Christ is leading us through the test, who is actually being tested?
Tonight we will consider another matter before the Lord, but before doing this, we have to review what we have seen
We have seen also that the life that God has ordained is a life that is far higher than our current Christian experience
We have seen that the overcoming life which God has given to us is Christ and that human ways, such as suppression, struggling, prayers, etc
A person might have been bound by any one of the eight kinds of sins mentioned before and been very bothered by it
We do not have to fight according to our own strength but according to the authority which God has given to us
It is true that the Bible says we should prevail over the enemy, but it also tells us that we should prevail over him by faith
It is true that the Bible says we should withstand the devil, but it also tells us to withstand him with the shield of faith
If we overcome first and then fight, and if we fight from the basis of victory, we will go from victory to victory
If there had been both the time and the opportunity for him to consider it, he might have had a chance to put his temper away
After we have entered the experience of the overcoming life we still have to say two prayers every morning when we rise up from our bed
There is no need to exercise our strength to lose our temper; our temper is aroused as soon as we are stirred up
We sin without any determination on our part because we are joined to Adam; we do not have to exercise any strength to sin
Every day when we wake up, we should believe that God can deliver us from the temptations which we have no time to think about
Just as we lose our temper without thinking about it, we can dispel our temper without thinking about it as well
If we live according to the senses of our physical organs in the physical world, we will substantiate the physical world
In other words, when we exercise our senses, we live in Adam, but when we exercise our faith, we immediately live in Christ
Those who are stubborn are always stubborn those who are narrowminded are always narrowminded and those who are jealous are always jealous
The Chinese have an expression: 'As long as the green mountain remains, there is no fear of the shortage of firewood'
When we are in Adam and we feel cold, callous, and unclean, it means that we are indeed cold, callous, and unclean
Some are too proud; they think that after they have overcome and are sanctified there is no need to go further
When we overcome, we overcome only the sins that we know of; we cannot overcome the sins that we do not know of
There are, however, sins that we are not aware of, and these are not included in our experience of the victory of Christ
If Miss Fischbacher said that there was such-and-such a thing, the co-worker would deny that there was such a thing
Every time Miss Fischbacher saw this person, she would either pat her shoulder or shake her hand as an outward sign of love
She did not hate that person, and she had spent time with her, but it was difficult for her to love this person
They also recalled Psalm 16:11, which says, 'In Your presence is fullness of joy; / At Your right hand there are pleasures forever'
You have said that You will be with us until the consummation of the age; therefore, we say that loneliness is a sin
From the time that they dealt with their loneliness in such a specific way, their loneliness never came back to them
Brothers and sisters, once we see a sin, we have to confess it before the Lord and also acknowledge that the Lord is living within us
The more light that a man receives, the more he advances, and the less light that a man receives, the less he advances
If we do this day by day, our growth will be beyond anyone's expectation because it will be the work of Christ alone
The word 'salvation' can be translated as 'victory' , and the words 'shout victoriously' can be translated as 'rejoice'
Victory tells us that the work is done and still prevailing, while boasting in victory is a continuous proclamation after the act of victory
One competes for an hour, sweating and striving; he hits the ball through one gate, another gate, and finally through the last gate
Please remember that after a Christian has overcome, he should continue to exercise his mouth to boast in victory
If our tone is wrong, others will doubt whether we have overcome, and we also will doubt whether we have overcome
At that time the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other besides the Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle
For we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee'
He acknowledged this by saying that he did not have the strength to withstand the enemy and did not know what to do
He not only stood still and watched the battle, but he also fell down on his face to worship God when he heard the word of the prophet!
They had the tone of victory because they knew that Jehovah had given them the victory and that the enemies were already defeated
As the people were beginning to sing, the Lord set an ambush against the Ammonites, Moabites, and children of Mount Seir
Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to acknowledge that we cannot make it, and it is not enough to believe that God can make it
Every overcomer should have two praises: praises before his eyes see the result and praises after his eyes see the result
We do not have to wait until we have actually failed, been defiled, and sinned before saying that we are defeated
Brothers and sisters, the overcoming life that God has given sings 'hallelujah' every day; it rejoices every day
Even when large armies are threatening us and great tribulations are awaiting us, we can still rejoice and praise the Lord
When he woke up in the hospital after the accident, he was asked whether he could still thank and praise the Lord
Enemies come, friends come, unbelievers come, brothers come, and reasonable as well as unreasonable things come
Peter 4:12 says that we should rejoice not only in the midst of trials, but also in anticipation of the trials
Nothing can put us above the temptations, circumstances, and difficulties more than joy, thanksgiving, and praise
If we weep when others weep and become frustrated when others are frustrated, we will become the same as everyone else
If it is the Lord's victory, they can thank and praise the Lord greatly in the midst of the reproach and persecution
While he prayed, he maintained a nice attitude and even conversed with his enemy on subjects like the news and sports
Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:10, 'I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses'
Others may wonder what is happening to us, but we can give thanks in everything and praise the Lord for everything
The Lord's victory is always one that more than conquers, and the only way to have the victory that more than conquers is by rejoicing
To him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two'
Some have said that we should consecrate ourselves before we overcome and that we must consecrate ourselves before we can overcome
Today we may make a vow before the Lord, telling the Lord that we will do this and do that, but tomorrow we may forget all about it
We must realize that the first thing we should do after experiencing the overcoming life is consecrate ourselves to the Lord
Chapters three and four are on the blood; chapter five is on forgiveness, while chapters six through eight are on the cross
As far as His sovereign right is concerned and as far as redemption is concerned, we belong to God, but He does not force us to do anything
Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, his slaves you are whom you obey'?
On the one hand we are His slaves because He has purchased us but on the other hand we are His slaves because we want to be such voluntarily
As far as experience is concerned, we become His slaves the day we willingly tell the Lord, 'I consecrate myself to You'
Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, his slaves you are whom you obey'?
Every saved person has the feeling that he should live for the Lord, yet he does not have the strength to do so
Immediately, he called in a blacksmith and broke her chains and declared that she was free, saying, 'I did not buy you to be my slave
Romans 6 tells us to consecrate ourselves, that is, our members, to God, while Romans 12 tells us to consecrate our bodies to Him
If a man does not love the Lord more than his parents, wife, children, and friends, he is not worthy to be the Lord's disciple
A brother was determined to make the top grade on his graduation examination and to rank at the top in his college class
There are many brothers and sisters whose pursuit of education becomes their hope; they hope to excel above others
John's College in Shanghai for two years and then to America on the condition that he come back after his study abroad to serve his school
After his prayer, he went to the principal and told him that he had decided not to sign the agreement and would no longer be going
Your cousins do not even have the money to go to school, and yet you want to throw away this great opportunity'
