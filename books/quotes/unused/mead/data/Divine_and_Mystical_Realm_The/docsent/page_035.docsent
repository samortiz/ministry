   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Blending of the Universal Body of Christ 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Having Blended the Body Together</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has blended the Body together 1 Cor 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word blended also means adjusted, harmonized, tempered, and mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has blended the Body, adjusted the Body, harmonized the Body, tempered the Body, and mingled the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for blended implies the losing of distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One brother's distinction may be quickness, and another's may be slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in the Body life the slowness disappears and the quickness is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All such distinctions are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has blended all the believers of all different races and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who can make the blacks and the whites lose their distinctions?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only God can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A husband and a wife can have the harmony in their marriage life only by losing their distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to be harmonized, blended, adjusted, mingled, and tempered in the Body life, we have to go through the cross and be by the Spirit, dispensing Christ to others for the sake of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The co-workers and elders must learn to be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever we do should be by the Spirit to dispense Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Also, what we do should not be for our interest and according to our taste but for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as we practice these points, we will have the blending.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of these points mean that we should fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a co-worker does anything, he should fellowship with the other co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An elder should fellowship with the other elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fellowship tempers us; fellowship adjusts us; fellowship harmonizes us; and fellowship mingles us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should forget about whether we are slow or quick and just fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not do anything without fellowshipping with the other saints who are coordinating with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fellowship requires us to stop when we are about to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our coordination in the church life, in the Lord's work, we all have to learn not to do anything without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among us we should have the blending of all the individual members of the Body of Christ, the blending of all the churches in certain districts, the blending of all the co-workers, and the blending of all the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Blending means that we should always stop to fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we will receive many benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we isolate and seclude ourselves, we will lose much spiritual profit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Learn to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Learn to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From now on, the churches should come together frequently to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may not be used to it, but after we begin to practice blending a few times, we will acquire the taste for it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the most helpful thing in the keeping of the oneness of the universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today it is very convenient for us to blend with one another because of this modern age with its modern conveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we blend together, we have the cross and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the cross and the Spirit, all that we have is the flesh with division.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not easy to be crucified and to do all things by the Spirit in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why we must learn to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Blending requires us to be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Blending requires us to be by the Spirit to dispense Christ and to do everything for the sake of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may come together without much blending because everyone stays in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are afraid to offend others and make mistakes, so they keep quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the manner of man according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come together, we should experience the terminating of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we should learn how to follow the Spirit, how to dispense Christ, and how to say and do something for the benefit of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That will change the entire atmosphere of the meeting and will temper the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Blending is not a matter of being quiet or talkative but a matter of being tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can be in harmony, because we have been tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, the distinctions will all be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Blending means to lose the distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all have to pay some price to practice the blending.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A group of elders may meet together often without being blended.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be blended means that you are touched by others and that you are touching others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But you should touch others in a blending way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Go through the cross, do things by the Spirit, and do everything to dispense Christ for His Body's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not come to a blending meeting to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to prepare ourselves to say something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord may use you, but you need to be tempered and crossed out, and you need to learn how to follow the Spirit to dispense Christ for His Body's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I was only about twenty-seven years old, a church was raised up in my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I learned to do everything through the cross and by the Spirit to minister Christ for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because I was young, I prayed the prayer of Solomon: "Lord, give me the wisdom to go out and to come in among Your people" 2 Chron 1:10 , and the Lord answered me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Through the years, I have learned to be blended among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Blending Not Being Social</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Such a blending is not social but the blending of the very Christ whom the individual members, the district churches, the co-workers, and the elders enjoy, experience, and partake of.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For the Building Up of the Body of Christ to Consummate the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The blending is for the building up of the universal Body of Christ Eph 1:23 to consummate the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 as the final goal of God's economy according to His good pleasure Eph 3:8-10; 1:9-10 .</S>
