   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we want to differentiate clearly between sin and sins, there is one portion of the Scriptures which we must consider.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is the first eight chapters of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These eight chapters show us the full significance of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these eight chapters we find one outstanding feature: from chapter one through 5:11, only the word sins is mentioned; sin is never mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But from 5:12 until the end of chapter eight, what we find is sin, not sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From chapter one through 5:11, Romans shows us that man has committed sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From 5:12 on, Romans shows us what kind of person man is before God: he is a sinner before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin refers to the life that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Prior to Romans 5:12, there is no mention of the dead being made alive, for the problem there is not that one needs to be made alive, but that the individual sins that one has committed need to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From 5:12 on, we have the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see something strong and powerful within us as a law in our members, which is sin, that compels and drags us to commit sinful acts, that is, sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this, there is the need of being freed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sins have to do with our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the Bible shows us that for our sins we need forgiveness Matt 26:28; Acts 2:38; 10:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But sin is that which entices and compels us to commit sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the Bible shows us that we need to be freed from sin Rom 6:18, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once I met a missionary who talked about "the forgiveness of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Right away I stood up and grasped his hand and asked, "Where in the Bible does it say the forgiveness of sin'?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He contended that there are many such cases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I asked if he could find one for me, he said, "What do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can you not find even one place that says this?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told him that nowhere in the entire Bible are the words the forgiveness of sin mentioned; instead, the Bible always speaks of "the forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the sins that are forgiven, not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not believe my words, so he went to look this up in his Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually he told me, "Mr. Nee, it is so strange.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every time this phrase is used, a little s is added in."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that you can see that it is the sins that are forgiven, not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sins are outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is why they need to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But something else is inside of us, something strong and powerful that compels us to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this we do not need forgiveness; for this our one need is to be freed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as we are no longer under its power and have nothing to do with it, we will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The solution to sins comes from forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The solution to sin, however, comes when we are no longer under its power and have nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sins are a matter of our actions and are committed one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is why they need to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But sin is within us, and we need to be freed from it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Bible never says "forgiveness of sin" but "forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither does the Bible speak about being "freed from sins."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can assure you that the Bible never says this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead the Bible says that we are "freed from sin," rather than from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only thing that we need to escape and be freed from is that which entices us and compels us to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This distinction is clearly made in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can compare the two in this way:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sin, according to the Scriptures, is said to be in the flesh; whereas sins are in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sin is a principle in us; it is a principle of the life we have.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sins are acts committed by us; they are acts in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sin is a law in the members.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sins are transgressions that we commit; they are activities and real acts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sin is related to our being; sins are related to our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sin is what we are; sins are what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sin is in the realm of our life; sins are in the realm of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sin is related to the power of the life we possess; sins are related to the power of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A person is governed by the sin in his natural life, but he is condemned in his conscience by the sins committed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sin is something considered as a whole; sins are something considered case by case.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sin is inside man; sins are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sin requires our being made free; sins require our being forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sin is related to sanctification; sins are related to justification.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sin is a matter of overcoming; sins are a matter of having peace in one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sin is in man's nature; sins are in man's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Figuratively speaking, sin is like a tree, and sins are like the fruit of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can make this matter clear with a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In preaching the gospel, we often compare the sinner to a debtor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all realize that to be a debtor is not a pleasant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But we must remember that it is one thing for a man to have debts; it is another thing for a man to have a disposition for incurring debts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person who borrows again and again is not that concerned about using others' money.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible says that Christians should not be debtors Rom 13:8 ; they should not borrow from others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A person with a borrowing disposition may borrow two or three hundred dollars from someone today, then two or three thousand dollars from someone else tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even if he is unable to pay back his debts, and his relatives or friends have to pay back the money for him, after a few days he will begin to consider borrowing again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This shows that to borrow is one thing, but to have a borrowing disposition is another.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The sins that the Bible describes are like the outward debts, while sin is like the inward habit and disposition; it is like the mind that is inclined to borrow easily.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A person with such a mind will not stop borrowing just because someone else has paid his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the contrary, he may borrow even more because others are now paying his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why God is dealing not just with the record of sins, but also with the inclination toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can see that it is important to deal with the sins, but it is equally important to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only when we see both of these aspects can our understanding of our salvation be complete.</S>
