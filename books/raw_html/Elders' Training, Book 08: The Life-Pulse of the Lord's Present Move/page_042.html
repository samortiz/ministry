 <h2 class="head1">BEING ONE WITH THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>I received a long letter of twenty-seven pages on the morning of our final day of fellowship in this elders&rsquo; training. The first page is the contents of the letter and all the rest of the twenty-six pages are signatures. All of the signatures are designated from the different churches. After reading the contents, I am so grateful to the four hundred and nineteen brothers who signed it. The contents of this letter follow along with my letter of response to the brothers who signed it.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Lee,</p>
<p>After hearing your fellowship in this elders&rsquo; training, we all agree to have a new start in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. For this, we all agree to be in one accord and to carry out this new move of the Lord solely through prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. We further agree to practice the recovery one in: teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression.</p>
<p>We repudiate all differences among the churches, and all indifference toward the ministry, the ministry office, and the other churches. We agree that the church in our place be identical with all the local churches throughout the earth.</p>
<p>We also agree to follow your leading as the one who has brought us God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and has led us into its practice. We agree that this leading is indispensable to our oneness and acknowledge the one trumpet in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry and the one wise master builder among us.</p>
<p>We further agree to practice the church life in our locality absolutely in a new way: to build the church in, through, and based upon home meetings; to lead every member to get used to functioning without any idea to depend on any giant speakers; to teach all the saints to know the basic truths in an educational way that they may teach others for the spreading of the truth; to build up the saints in the growth in life that they may minister life to others, shepherd each other, and take care of the backsliding ones; to lead all the saints to preach the gospel in every possible way; to avoid leadership as much as possible; and to have home gatherings for nurturing the saints in life and big meetings for educating the saints in truths.</p>
<p>We agree that all the preceding points are the clear and definite teaching of the Bible according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Finally, we agree that the success of this new move is our responsibility and will rise up to labor and endeavor with our whole being, looking to the Lord for His mercy and grace that we would be faithful to the end.</p>

Elders&rsquo; Training</p>
<p>Dear Brothers:</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter dated February 21, 1986 with the list of signatures. I feel very sorry that I could not have time to acknowledge, with appreciation, what you have expressed in your letter and through your signatures until now.</p>
<p>Being one with the ministry is a crucial matter, and its effects are exceedingly serious. Its proper definition is not to follow any man, any doctrine or any movement, but is to be one with the Lord&rsquo;s move today according to the Lord&rsquo;s vision, without any intrinsic element of exalting any person or promoting any work. May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us, that this action would not be misunderstood or misapplied by anyone in a way that would give the enemy Satan ground for utilization, thus frustrating the Lord&rsquo;s move today, but rather that this action could be properly used by the Lord to swallow up all the germs of discord which have been existing, even among us, for quite a time in the past. May the Lord remember your kind wishes for me and bless your labors in Him.</p>
