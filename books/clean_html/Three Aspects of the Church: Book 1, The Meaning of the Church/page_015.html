<h2 class="head3">God Recovering the Oneness by Life</h2>
<p>The oneness in God&rsquo;s creation is according to His power. By His power God caused all things to function in a normal relationship with Him. Because of their relationship and function toward God under the power of His creation, all things were in harmony and the universe was one. Then Satan rebelled and brought death into the universe. Once rebellion and death entered all things, the oneness was lost, and all things entered into a state of discord. Today people disobey God, and those who are in lower positions disobey and even oppose those who are above them. Although God upholds all things by His power, the oneness has been broken; therefore, God must come in to recover the oneness by His life, not by His power.</p>
<p>God begins this work of recovery in the church. By His life He is recovering oneness in the church, and He will eventually recover oneness among all things. Formerly, we were dead in offenses and sins, alienated from the life of God, and were enemies of God, but God&rsquo;s mercy reached us (Eph. 2:1-4). Through the redemption of the cross and through our believing, God forgave us of our sins and imparted His life into us. Once God&rsquo;s life entered into us, we were joined to Him, not only recovering our relationship with God as our Creator but also entering into union with Him in His life. Thus, our function toward God, for which we were created, has been recovered. This function enables us to rule for God, to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, to fulfill God&rsquo;s will, and to live out God Himself. The corruption that was brought in through death is altogether swallowed up by life. There is now complete harmony and one accord in our relationship with God. This is the oneness God desires to recover.</p>
<p>In our experience, whether or not we arrive at the oneness that God desires, depends upon our arriving at the full knowledge of the Son of God. Ephesians 4:13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; For us to arrive at the oneness is for us to arrive at the full-grown Christ and to allow the fullness of Christ to be manifested among us. Whenever we are short of Christ, we are short of the oneness, and whenever we lack the element of Christ, we are in disharmony. Life brings in light; and light, which is the knowledge of the Son of God, issues in harmony and oneness.</p>
<p>Today is not the time for God to deal with all things; rather, now is the time for God to deal with the church. God must deal with the church; otherwise, there will be no way for all things to become one. God&rsquo;s dealing begins with the church as the firstfruits among all things. In order to carry out His complete work of restoration, He must first carry out His work of recovering the oneness of the church. This is the work of recovery, and it is carried out by God&rsquo;s life, not by God&rsquo;s methods, power, or acts; it is altogether a matter of life.</p>
<p>The condition of oneness expressed through the church, depends upon the degree to which the church possesses God&rsquo;s life in Christ. Oneness does not come from talking but from growth. If we do not allow God&rsquo;s life to grow in us, no matter how much we desire to be one with the brothers and sisters, we will not be able to be one. The only way to recover the oneness of the church is by life. This oneness is in the fellowship. Our fellowship is not based on having the same mind or sharing the same view; rather, it is altogether based on life. The fellowship is life.</p>
<p>Satan brought death into all things, causing all things to be separated from God. However, God has come into us as life, causing us to be joined to Him. Whenever we touch life, we enter into God more deeply and are one with those in life. Hence, when life comes in, it brings in oneness. Oneness is simply life. Where there is life, there is oneness, and where there is oneness, there is the Head. When life comes, the Head also comes; when the Head comes, oneness comes as well. If we do not have much experience of being in life, we will not have much experience of being under the authority of the Head. All things not under the Head are in discord and death.</p>
