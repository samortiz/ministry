<h2 class="head1">A CHRISTIAN'S POSITION ON EARTH</h2><h2 class="head2">In the Kingdom of His Beloved&mdash;<br />Being Heavenly Citizens</h2><p>Just as Christ maintained His position on earth, a Christian should do the same. Christians should not organize political activities, nor should they take advantage of the political system. Everything the Lord avoided in this world should be avoided by Christians, and everything that the Lord partook of in this world should be shared by Christians. We should be the same as He. This is the Christian position. In John 18:36 the Lord said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling..." Following this the Lord said, "My kingdom is not from here." His attendants need not struggle, because He was not establishing any earthly rule. In Colossians 1:13 Paul said, "Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love." He has saved us and delivered us into another kingdom. This kingdom is not concerned with any politics; it is the kingdom of God's Beloved. The kingdom to which a Christian belongs is spiritual; it is in life and has nothing to do with politics or religion.</p><p>Philippians 3:20 says, "For our commonwealth exists in the heavens." What position should a believer take? Paul said that we are citizens of heaven. In ancient times there were two kinds of citizens in the Roman Empire. Some were Roman citizens, and others were subjects of the empire. Roman citizens enjoyed many rights. They had the right to vote and be elected. They could enjoy all the privileges that the empire provided. The subjects, however, did not have that much right. They were only subordinate vassals in the Roman empire. This is the reason they were called the subjects. We are heavenly citizens; our kingdom is in the heavens. On earth we are pilgrims and sojourners. Although our earthly country recognizes our rights, these rights merely mean that we agree to abide as lawful citizens of our state. We have no intention of involving ourselves in politics. Strictly speaking, every believer is a foreigner within his own country. The kingdom to which the believers belong has citizens, but no territory. It has commandments, but no constitution. It has love, but no army. At the end of Mark the Lord said to the disciples, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation" (16:15). This proves that they were not men belonging to earthly nations; their position was basically heavenly. Today God's children are in the world just as Moses was in Midian and the Israelites were in Egypt; they were all pilgrims. We should do our best to make peace with men, to help them, and to lead them to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Standing Apart from Politics</h2><p>A Christian stands apart from all kinds of politics. For two thousand years God's children have been citizens of the heavenly kingdom. They never enjoy being involved with earthly things. They are reluctant even to vote. They do not like to touch worldly politics. A British brother once said that he had been a believer for sixty years but had never known what voting was. The Lord always stood apart from all the nations of the earth. We should do the same. If we live in the spiritual kingdom, we will realize that all the activities of the Roman Catholic Church are wrong. At the time Paul fulfilled his ministry, there were many believers everywhere. Communication was frequent, and the number of believers great. (It was said that if the Roman Empire killed all the Christians in Rome, there would not have been many people left in the city.) However, the apostles did not capitalize on this fact. They did not organize the believers together to engage in politics. They did not utilize the Christian community to gain power politically. Martin Luther realized the mistake of Catholicism and suggested dissociating the church from political influence. In Acts 21:38, when Paul was tried, the commander asked, "You are not then the Egyptian who some days ago revolted and led out the four thousand men of the Assassins into the wilderness?" The Romans did not understand what Paul was doing. They thought that a man with such a great following would surely have political motives. Roman Catholicism wields its political power from its numbers. Today's Christians should return to Paul's position; they should stand apart from all politics.</p>
