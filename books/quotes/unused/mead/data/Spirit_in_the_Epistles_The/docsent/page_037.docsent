   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dear brothers and sisters, learn to enter into the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today many brothers and sisters are still living in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If they turn to their spirit, it is only a moment before they come out of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, a husband and a wife who are believers in the Lord may argue at times over certain trivial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please consider, when they are arguing, are they running out or entering in?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sisters, do not blame me for saying that in general the sisters are more skillful than the brothers in arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a couple argues, eight out of ten times, the husband loses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, I ask the sisters, when you are arguing, are you entering in or running out?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a matter of fact, you are running out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more you argue, the more you are outside.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more you argue, the more reasons you have, and there is no end to your reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, your emotion is stirred up, and your will also joins in. Occasionally this may even result in fights.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At times a sister may feel that she has been wronged, so she goes to the elders to bring a charge against her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was in North China, I was involved a great deal in taking care of the affairs of the local church, so I often encountered this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes a sister came to me and said, "Brother Lee, look at your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>" At that time, because I was still young, I did not have a good understanding of these things, so I often tried to counsel the sister.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Little did I know that the more I counseled her, the more her whole being turned to go out, to the extent that even my whole being also went outside.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consequently, there was nothing that I could do, and everything became a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Slowly I began to find the secret; I realized that the best way was not to say anything to her, not to give her any advice, and not to reason with her, but to help her pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once we prayed together, her being, which had turned outward, began to turn inward.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes she began to weep just by calling, "O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This happened quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why did it happen?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was because she had turned back to her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once she did that, she entered the Holy of Holies and touched the throne of grace to receive mercy and obtain grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, out of such a place living waters flowed forth to solve all her problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This surpassed any amount of human speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the secret of Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, Hebrews speaks about discerning the spirit and entering into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not discern the spirit, you are in the soul and not in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, the secret of Christian living is absolutely not a matter of dealing with anything outwardly but a matter of returning to the spirit to enter into the Holy of Holies, to come before the throne of grace, where there is mercy and grace flowing forth as living waters to transform us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Christian is not one who has been changed on the outside but one who has been transformed on the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today there is truly a great mystery within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In these recent years, having been led by the Lord to pay attention particularly to the matter of the spirit, I sense that it is truly mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit, as the speaking Spirit, the Spirit of grace, and the unlimited, eternal Spirit, is right within our spirit, making our spirit God's Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Christ who lives in us is the throne of grace as the base, the ground, for the dispensing of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Him, God is pleased to dispense grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once you turn to the spirit, you meet Christ and God; grace and mercy flow as living waters within you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then all of your problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, I repeat, brothers and sisters, where is the key to the book of Hebrews?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is in the Holy of Holies, and this Holy of Holies is your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The key to this book is in 4:12; that is, we need to discern the spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now you understand why this matter is mentioned only in this Epistle and not in the other Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This book shows us that the exodus from Egypt of the children of Israel in the Old Testament and their wandering in the wilderness is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The New Testament believers may be just like them, wandering outside of the Holy of Holies and never entering into the rest to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the good land is Christ, who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not turn to the spirit, we will be wandering in the wilderness of our soul and not entering into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you read 4:9-12, you will know that there is a rest that remains for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be diligent to enter into that rest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word of God is living and is able to divide our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is thus that we are able to enter into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason, these verses say that you must divide the spirit from the soul and that you must not remain in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you remain in the soul, you are still wandering in the wilderness and are unable to enter into rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, do you see how great this grace is?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Old Testament, only the High Priest could enter into the Holy of Holies, but today every saved person can enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, this depends on your decision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you remain in the outer court, you are only a Levite.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you reach only the Holy Place, you are only a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you turn to the spirit, to contact the Lord Himself directly, then you are a high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether you are a Levite, a priest, or a high priest depends on you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord's desire is that you be a high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He desires that you enter into the Holy of Holies, to come forward to the throne of grace, to receive mercy and obtain grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Satan's strategy is to continuously tempt us to go outside.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once you are outside, you are defeated; you have fallen into Satan's deception.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, once you turn to the spirit, you can overcome, you are in the heavens, and you are in the Lord's Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is with you, and once you touch His throne of grace, His mercy and grace will flow as the living waters to water you continually within.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is something that the unbelievers do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This truly is tremendous grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you truly touch this, you will have no unresolved problems.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every problem will automatically be solved.</S>
