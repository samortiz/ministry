   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REDEEMING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In New Jerusalem we have the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day, because man had fallen, the creating God became the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 3:15 the redeeming God came as the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seed of the woman is simply the redeeming God, God becoming the seed of woman to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This redeeming God is called the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 1:29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 22:1 speaks of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both God and the Lamb are sitting on one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For years I was not able to understand how two could sit on one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Certainly they are not sitting side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, God is in the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know this by the fact that God is the light and that the Lamb is the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The light and the lamp are not side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The light is in the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This proves that God is in the Lamb sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the two are actually one, just as the light and the lamp are one unit, one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In like manner, God and the Lamb are one entity, not two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God in the Lamb is the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For eternity in New Jerusalem we shall see the redeeming God, God in the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE RIVER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 22:1 says that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the water of life to flow out of the throne means that it flows out of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to understand this we must go back to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Gospel of John firstly tells us that God was in the beginning, then that this very God became flesh to be the Lamb John 1:1, 14, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, in chapter seven of John we are told of rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being John 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Apostle John tells us that these rivers refer to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, in the Gospel of John we firstly have God; secondly, the Lamb; and thirdly, the Spirit as the rivers of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In New Jerusalem we have God in the Lamb, and out of this redeeming God flows the river of life, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a picture of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Out of God in the Lamb flows the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before God could dispense Himself into us, He had to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the picture in Revelation 22 reveals that the redeeming God is the life-dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lamb signifies redemption, and the river of life signifies the dispensation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For eternity, our God will be the redeeming and life-dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, our God is in the redeeming Lamb, flowing out as the river of life to dispense His life into every part of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree of life grows in the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a portrait of the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church life our God is the redeeming God and the life-dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah, in the church our God is in the Lamb, flowing as the life-giving Spirit to reach us all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When this flow of the life-giving Spirit reaches us and gets into us, we receive the life supply and are nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are satisfied and filled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way the Triune God is dispensed into us!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE SUPPLY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>New Jerusalem is a square city with three gates on each of its four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The city proper is a mountain of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the top of this mountain is the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which flows the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tree of life grows in the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The river of life flows out of the throne and spirals down the mountain, eventually reaching all twelve gates on each of the four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that the flow of the Triune God waters the whole city.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every part of the city receives the life supply, because the tree of life grows in the river and the river reaches every part of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The tree of life is not a tall tree; rather, it is a vine growing on both sides of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only as a vine could its growth follow the flow of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The river moves in spiral fashion, and the tree grows in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is like a grapevine, making many turns as it grows along the flow of the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Wherever the river flows, the tree of life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, the supply of life is in the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the church life today we have the flow of the river of life, that is, the flow of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With this life-giving Spirit we have Christ as the tree of life to be our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The life, the light, the redeeming God, and the Spirit as the flow of life are all in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are you in the city?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all must answer, Hallelujah, we are in the city!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We know that we are in the city by the fact that we are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the twelve Apostles are stones, the foundation upon which we are built, and we also are stones Rev 21:14; 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed upon the gates of the city Rev 21:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The twelve tribes of Israel represent the Old Testament saints, and the twelve Apostles represent the New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The children of Israel and the Apostles are in the city, and we also are in it.</S>
