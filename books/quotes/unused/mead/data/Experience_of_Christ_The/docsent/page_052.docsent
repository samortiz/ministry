   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN COUNTING GAINS LOSS FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of all the Epistles written by Paul only Philippians is clearly and definitely related to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen, Philippians comes between Ephesians, a book on the church, and Colossians, a book on the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that in order for us, the members of the Body, to reach the Head, we need the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>LIVING CHRIST AND MAGNIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Philippians 1 Paul says, "Christ shall be magnified in my body" v. 20 , and, "For to me to live is Christ" v. 21 . The statement, "To live is Christ," is simple, but very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we had spoken these words instead of the Apostle Paul, others might accuse us of blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They might wonder how we could dare say that for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul had the boldness to utter these words because his vision was clear and his experience was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul had seen clearly that in God's economy for him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He not only saw this, but also lived according to this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also need to have such a clear vision and a rich experience of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should be able to say, "For us to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For us to live is not a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 20 Paul says that Christ would be magnified in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not many Christians know the significance of the word "magnify" in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may say that to be magnified means to be expressed, exalted, glorified, or honored.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, it does mean these things, but these words do not touch the significance of the word "magnify."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For Christ to be magnified in us means that we experience the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is magnified through His unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, our love is limited because it is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason there are so many separations and divorces is that human love is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is unlimited, but we are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we live by Christ in any matter, that matter will be unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if we live by ourselves in the same matter, it will be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we love others with our own love, we shall discover that eventually our love will be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ones we love will place more and more demands upon us to exhaust our love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The love of a husband is exhausted by his wife, the love of parents is exhausted by their children, and the love of the elders is exhausted by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we may be exhausted, Christ is never exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more love we require, the more love He affords to meet our requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, to live by Christ in the matter of loving others is to magnify Christ by His unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true regarding humility and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our humility and patience are limited, but the humility and patience of Christ are unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we live by Christ in the matters of humility and patience, we magnify Him.</S>
