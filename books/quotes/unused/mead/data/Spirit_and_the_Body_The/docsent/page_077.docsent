   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPEAKING THAT EXPRESSES CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eloquence does not express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the contrary, an eloquent sermon is a form of entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we exercise to have the practice of the Body, so many halting ones will begin to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the members exercise their spirit to be spiritual and to speak for Christ, something of Christ will be manifested, although their speaking will not be eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For the long run, we need meetings filled with speaking that is not eloquent, yet speaking through which Christ is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of meeting edifies the saints and builds them up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need a change of taste.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are accustomed to a diet of eloquence and musical messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we need now are words spoken haltingly that manifest Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that this is Paul's meaning in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ELOQUENCE CAUSING DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to our natural concept, we admire eloquent speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But to admire eloquence is to damage the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason God has had to temper the Body together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I thank God that He has been tempering the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has humbled the eloquent speakers, and He has raised up the halting ones to speak for Him in order that there should be no division in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In today's Christianity there is division everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most of these divisions have been caused by eloquent speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every eloquent speaker will draw a group to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who admire various kinds of musical speech will gather around the eloquent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not appreciate such "music."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, I prefer to listen to the little ones speaking in a halting way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We in the church life must no longer exalt eloquence, because the eloquent speakers create division and draw a following.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christianity today there is a great deal of competition in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whoever is an outstanding speaker will have a large following.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this will cause a big division.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This trend still influences the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we must rise up to oppose it and learn how to adorn the less honorable ones, the ones who speak haltingly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to say, "Praise the Lord for this brother!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He speaks haltingly, but he has a life-giving matter to share with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We wish to adorn him, beautify him, and honor him."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In these messages I am not teaching you mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am passing on to you what I have learned through the years so that we may have the proper Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose an eloquent speaker comes into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Will you still admire him?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do, it means that there is no Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, by admiring the eloquent one you create a division and kill the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will help to produce an atmosphere in which those who cannot speak well will be despised.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not give so many crowns of honor to the eloquent speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, we need to buy shoes to adorn the halting and stammering ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to encourage the less honorable members to speak again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will build up the Body life and establish the genuine Body ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the long run, eloquent speakers damage the Body life, but the halting speakers build it up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is utterly different from the practice in today's Christianity, and it absolutely contradicts our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, for the sake of the proper Body life, we must all learn this lesson.</S>
