   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GIVE, AND IT WILL BE GIVEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have seen a few brothers and sisters who fell into dire need because they were unfaithful in the matter of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were not actually lacking in income.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows us a fundamental principle one must give to become rich and one becomes poor by accumulating riches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whoever cares only for himself is destined to be in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whoever learns to give is destined to have riches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s Word says it, and it is true.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we want to escape poverty, we have to give again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we give, the more God will give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we are willing to share our surplus with others, others will also be happy to share their surplus with us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we give one-twentieth to others, others will also give one-twentieth to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we give one-thousandth to others, others will also give one-thousandth to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With what measure we measure to others, with the same measure others will measure to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In what capacity we treat our brothers and sisters, with the same capacity God will treat us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are willing to sacrifice our livelihood, others will also sacrifice their livelihood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we only give others that which is totally useless, things which we never use, others will certainly give us totally useless and unusable things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people have problems with their income because they have problems with their giving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a person has no problem with his giving, it is hard to imagine that he will have problems with his income.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s Word is quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we give to others, the Lord will give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not give to others, the Lord will not give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most people only exercise faith when they ask God for money; they do not exercise faith in giving money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is no wonder that they have no faith to receive anything from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers, as soon as we become Christians, we have to learn the basic lesson of financial stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christians have a unique way of managing their wealth: What we receive depends on what we give.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the Christian way of financial stewardship is to receive according to what we give.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Worldly people give according to what they have received, but we receive according to what we give.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our inflow depends on our outflow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who crave money and cling to it can never receive God s money; they will never receive any supply from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should all look to the Lord for our needs, but God will supply the needs of only one type of people those who give.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words good measure, which the Lord uses in Luke 6:38, are wonderful words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When God gives to man, He is never stingy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is ever generous and overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our God is always generous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our God s cup is always running over.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is never petty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He gives, He says that it will be a good measure, pressed down, and shaken together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider the way in which we buy rice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most rice merchants will not let us shake the measure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not allow the rice to settle before pouring it out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Lord said, Pressed down, shaken together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only so, it is running over.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our God is such a generous God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He gives by pressing down, shaking together, heaping up, and running over.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, He also says that with what measure we measure to others, it will be measured to us in return.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are shrewd and exact in giving to others, God will only touch others to give to us in a shrewd and exact way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must give first to others, before others will give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most people never learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They always want God to answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to give first before we can receive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have not received anything recently, it means that we have a problem in giving.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have been a Christian for more than twenty years, and I can surely bear witness to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever a person has a problem with his giving, he will experience a lack.</S>
