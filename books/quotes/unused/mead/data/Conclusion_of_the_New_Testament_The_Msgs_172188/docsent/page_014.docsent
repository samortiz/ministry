   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot live a life outside human society.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, there is the need for us to know what kind of attitude we should hold toward others, that is, toward unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 Being Subject to the Government</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In having the best attitude toward others, the believers first need to be subject to the government.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 13:1a Paul says, "Let every person be subject to the authorities over them."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A natural character is a rebellious character, but a transformed character is submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Subjecting ourselves to the government requires a certain amount of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, if we are submissive to God's appointed authorities in the government, it is an indicator that we have a certain amount of transformation, because our natural character and disposition are rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were born rebellious, and our natural response to authority is to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Subjection to authority requires transformation from the growth in life through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God. a Recognizing That the Authorities Are from God, Appointed by God, as Servants of God to the Believers for Their Good</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 4 says that the authority "is a servant of God to you for your good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if you do evil, fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who practices evil."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament clearly teaches that all authorities are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Human government with its authority was established by God during Noah's time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the flood, God gave man the authority to rule over others Gen 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was by this ruling authority among men that the nations were set up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, as Christians we must recognize that the authorities are from God and respect them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As servants of God, the authorities have been appointed by God to the believers for their good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that through the authorities God will allow us to live on earth in peace to be His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While we are living on earth, we surely need a peaceful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to maintain a peaceful situation there is the need of government with authority to rule over the people.</S>
