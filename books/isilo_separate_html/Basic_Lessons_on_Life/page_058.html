GOD THE FATHER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being the Source</H2><P>First, we need to see that God the Father is the source. John 15:1b says that He is the husbandman, the source, and in Ephesians 3:14-16 the apostle Paul prays to the Father as the source.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Abiding in Us</H2><P>The Father is also abiding in us. Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is over all, through all, and in all. The Father dwells in us in the Son as the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD THE SON</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being the Embodiment of the Father</H2><P>In John 15:1a, the Son said, "I am the true vine," and in John 14:11 He said that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him. Thus, the Son is the embodiment of the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Abiding in Us and<br>Making His Home in Our Hearts</H2><P>In John 15:4a the Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you." In Ephesians 3:17a Paul revealed that Christ is making His home in our hearts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD THE SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Reality of the Son</H2><P>The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality of the Son. In our speaking to the saints, we need to develop the Lord's words in John 14:17-20, which reveal the Spirit as the reality of the Son.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Dwelling in Us</H2><P>Romans 8:11 must be fully emphasized and developed to show the saints that in this one verse you can see that the Father is working, the Son is dispensing, and the Spirit is giving life. This verse shows us the functioning of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to dispense life into our being, even into the circumference of our being. The body is the circumference of our being, and the spirit is the center of our being. The indwelling Triune God dispenses life to our whole being, and this dispensing reaches even to our circumference, our body.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
