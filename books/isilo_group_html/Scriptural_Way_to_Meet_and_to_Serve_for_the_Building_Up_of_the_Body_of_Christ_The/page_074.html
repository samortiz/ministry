FOR THE SINNERS&rsquo; SALVATION</h2>
<p>We also need to pray to have a real burden for the sinners&rsquo; salvation. In 1 Timothy 2, Paul exhorts us to pray on behalf of all men (v. 1) because God our Savior desires all men to be saved (v. 4). God&rsquo;s desire requires our prayer for it to be carried out. In Romans 10:1, Paul said concerning the Jews, &ldquo;The delight of my heart and my supplication to God for them is for their salvation.&rdquo; Like Paul, the delight of our heart needs to be the salvation of men because this is the delight of God&rsquo;s heart (Luke 15:6-7, 9-10, 23-24). We need to pray to the Lord that His concern for sinners&rsquo; salvation would be dispensed into us to become our burden.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VISITING PEOPLE WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>We also must be those who visit people with Christ (Acts 10:24, 34-44). We must have the assurance and the confidence that we are going out to visit people for the gospel&rsquo;s sake with Christ and that Christ is going with us. We should not go to visit people on our own or by ourselves. We must visit others by Christ, who is going with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING AND CONVINCING PEOPLE<br />
THAT CHRIST MIGHT BE IMPARTED INTO THEM</h2>
<p>In our gospel visitation, we must contact and convince people with the goal of Christ being imparted into them (Acts 8:26-39). After contacting people, we need to convince them, and we cannot convince people with our own ordinary words. This is why we must pray, even while we are knocking on the doors. Then when people open their doors to us, they see us as persons in Christ, praying to Christ. At that juncture, some instant expression will come to us which we have to utter. This is the instant utterance, not the utterance prepared by us. Just as the letter kills (2 Cor. 3:6), the prepared and fixed utterance can kill. We must be open to the Lord for any kind of utterance.</p>
<p>You could say, &ldquo;I have come to bring the good news to you&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have come with Christ to visit you&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have come with God to see you&rdquo;; or &ldquo;Sir, I had a burden to come here to read the Bible with you.&rdquo; You do not need to repeat the same utterance all the time. Of course, under the anointing we may be led to repeat things as we speak to people. If you are under the anointing to repeat something to a person at a certain point, you have to repeat. You may need to repeat that man is a vessel created by God to contain Him. Quite often repetition is needed, but you should not always begin your talk with the same opening word. If you repeat the same opening word again and again in a mechanical way, you are like an actor and your visitation is a performance. You must be one with Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit. He is so living and so instant, and He can give you the instant utterance. The instant utterance given by Him will catch people. They will be so willing to open up themselves to you and to talk with you so that you can impart Christ into them.</p>
<p>A long talk with our new contact will kill him. We must open our talk immediately with an utterance that can impart Christ into him. We may tell this one that we have come with Christ to visit him, and we may go to a portion in <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> to show him that he is a vessel to contain Christ and that this very Christ is God Himself as the Spirit. We may tell him that this One, according to Romans 10, is here right now, even in his mouth and in his heart (v. 8). We can then direct him to receive the Lord by praying and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus (vv. 9-13). By speaking in this way, we put Christ into him. This way is quick, powerful, and full of impact. People can receive Christ in this way within five minutes.</p>
<p>The Spirit goes with us when we visit people for the gospel, He contacts people with us, and He enters into the homes with us. While we are contacting people, the Spirit of our Christ is waiting for the opportunity to get into them. When people pray with a sincere heart, they spontaneously exercise and open up their spirit. The Spirit is waiting for the time when someone will call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This is the time that the waiting Spirit can get into someone&rsquo;s open spirit. In this instant, regeneration transpires (John 3:6). It does not take long for a person to be regenerated. Too much talk will close a person&rsquo;s spirit. Good salesmen are trained not to speak their own words but to speak what they have been trained to speak. At a certain point, they stop talking and close the deal.</p>
<p>Some may disagree with this way, saying that we must visit and speak with an unbeliever several times before he is ready for regeneration and that we must wait until we are certain that he is regenerated before baptizing him. In the past, the saints used to bring new ones to the leading ones of the church for them to discern whether or not they were regenerated and ready for baptism. If a candidate could not pass this interview, he would have to be comforted and encouraged so that he would not be disappointed. The one who brought him to the Lord might tell him, &ldquo;I will help you learn more from the Bible about salvation to prepare you. The church will probably have another baptism in three weeks and that will not be too late for you to come back. By that time you will be able to pass the elders&rsquo; test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, however, there is not one instance where a believer is asked to wait for a time before he can be baptized. The Scriptures show us that once a person believes, he should be baptized immediately. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were baptized directly after believing (Acts 2:38, 41). The Ethiopian eunuch was baptized immediately after Philip realized that he had believed (Acts 8:38). After Philip had a short talk with this eunuch, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, &ldquo;Look, water! What prevents me from being baptized?&rdquo; Philip did not tell the eunuch to wait, but he immediately baptized him. Soon after the Apostle Paul had met the Lord on the road to Damascus, Ananias told him, &ldquo;Why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized...&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). There should not be a gap between believing and being baptized. Believing and being baptized are two parts of one complete step for salvation (Mark 16:16).</p>
<p>Brother Nee told me of the case of a young man who had believed in the Lord Jesus and was getting ready to come to the United States to study. Brother Nee was burdened that this young man be baptized before leaving China, so he referred this case to another co-worker. After this co-worker contacted the young believer, he told Brother Nee that it was too early to baptize him. Brother Nee told the co-worker that this young man was going to America to study, so there was no time to wait. The co-worker still insisted that it was too early to baptize him. Then Brother Nee said that if the baptism was wrong, he himself would bear the responsibility, but this co-worker still insisted that it was necessary to wait. Eventually, Brother Nee had no way to baptize this young believer. This concept of a waiting time between believing and being baptized is unscriptural. Today&rsquo;s Christianity, in general, does not practice baptizing people immediately after they believe, but we must take the biblical way. According to the Bible, anyone who believes in the Lord should be baptized immediately.</p>
<p>The Philippian jailer and his entire household were baptized by Paul and Silas immediately after they believed in the Lord Jesus (Acts 16:30-34). This baptism of the jailer and his family must have been in the bathing pool of the place where they were. Acts 16 tells us that after he and his household were baptized, &ldquo;he brought them up into his house&rdquo; (v. 34). According to the word &ldquo;up&rdquo; in verse 34, this bathing pool must have been in the basement. This shows that the baptisms of the early believers were without regulations and rituals, but they did what was convenient according to where they were. Under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty, there were homes in the ancient times that had such bathing facilities that could also be used as a baptistry. In today&rsquo;s modern age in the United States, it is even more convenient for us to baptize the new believers immediately since nearly every home has a bathtub and running water. This surely is scriptural. However, we should not baptize people in a light way; we must do it with much regard and much reverence.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
