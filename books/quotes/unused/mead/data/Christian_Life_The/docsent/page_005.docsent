   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Christ Being the Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the eternal life, eternal in time, quality, perfection, and completion, indestructible and incorruptible John 3:36; Heb 7:16b; 2 Tim 1:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone who believes into the Son, Christ, has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The life which Christ is, is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is perfect, not temporarily but eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is also eternally and entirely complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With us human beings, nothing is eternal or entirely complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many immigrants who come to the United States try to get permanent residence here, but who is permanent?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Very few have lived in the United States for over a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everyone eventually departs because human life is temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To God one thousand years equals one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, one hundred years is only one-tenth of a day in God's sight.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To remain somewhere for only one-tenth of a day is not permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God, however, lives from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 90 speaks of this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This psalm actually was the first psalm written because it was written by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Psalm 90:1 Moses said, "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then he said, "From eternity to eternity You are God" v. 2 . This means that Moses realized that God was his eternal dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From eternity to eternity, He is God and He is our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is eternally perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though we are not able to reside on this earth permanently, we already have a permanent residence in God, the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The eternal life, Christ, is also eternal in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In quality this life is eternally good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The quality of our human life, using Jeremiah's word, is like broken cisterns Jer 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our qualities are all broken qualities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may be clever, but our cleverness has been broken into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our human life, unlike the divine life, is not eternal in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The eternal life is also indestructible and incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We human beings can be destroyed by anything, and we are corruptible in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have some old books written by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As time goes on, they are corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today I dare not touch some of these books, for fear that they will fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Time wasted these books because they are corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We also become old and pass away because we are corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our nature is corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Christ, the One who is our life, is incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>D. Christ Being Life to His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is life to His believers in resurrection Col 3:4a; John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Resurrection means that this life has gone through death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People put this life into death, and this life came out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today He is a life in resurrection.</S>
