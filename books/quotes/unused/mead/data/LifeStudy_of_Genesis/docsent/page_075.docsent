   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Turbulence implies fullness cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 4:14; 7:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This river rushes like a mighty tide.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose we have a few drops of water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That amount of water cannot generate turbulence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to have a turbulence like Niagara Falls we need a great quantity of water.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jer 13:23; Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was a Cushite before I was saved: I was black, sinful, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In fact, we were all Cushites; we were more than black, and our nature was evil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Humanly speaking, such a nature can never change.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praise the Lord that the turbulence of the divine waters will regenerate us and transform us into another person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flowing of the divine river is so rich and strong that it can change our evil nature and even glorify us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the Cushite cannot change his skin, we have the way by which our black skin, our evil nature, can be fully transformed: it is by the rushing turbulence of the flow of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3 The Third Head</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The third head is Hiddekel the Hebrew name of Tigris which means rapid, implying power cf.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Water that flows rapidly has power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hiddekel flows toward Assyria, which means plain, the inhabited place.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The last head of the flow of living water makes us sweet, fertile, and fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Recently, we have been talking about fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can we bear fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can bear fruit only by the flow of the river of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as the life flows within, it will make us sweet, fertile, and fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we put all four heads of the one river together, we have a full picture of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need the whole New Testament to define the four heads of the one river of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once again I say that everything found in the book of Genesis is a seed, the growth of the seed is in the New Testament, and the harvest is in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The seed of the flowing river is sown in Genesis 2, the growth occurs in the following books of the Bible, and the harvest is in the book of Revelation.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This water will be a torrent flowing within us to regenerate us, transform us, and to make us sweet and fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this flow we will become gold, pearl, and precious stones for the building of God's habitation, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is God's way to fulfill His eternal purpose.</S>
