It is divided into four regions. The whole area is remote and mountainous. Transportation is very inconvenient. The work is very difficult, so only a little more than forty localities have established churches. In the past few years no one has been raised up to preach the gospel; therefore, no new local churches have been established. Thank the Lord! On the ninth day of the Chinese New Year, there was a meeting in Hsia-Dong-Si to discuss the gospel work. Some brothers were raised up to accompany Brother Lee Shu-ren of Ping-Yang. They left from Shi-Si on January 30 and preached the gospel in Region Three for more than twenty days. They preached in twelve villages. During the day they preached the gospel door to door and passed out tracts. In the evening they borrowed a house, gathered an audience, and announced the gospel. Many received the truth. Every evening they spoke to audiences of one, two, and even three hundred people. They were very orderly and serious. Praise the Lord! Some brothers have decided to go to the area around San-Men-Yang in Region Four to begin preaching the gospel. We look to the Lord for His leading. Please pray for us much.</p><p>Your little, weak brother,<br />Wang You-gao<br />Twenty-second day of the third month</p><h2 class="head2">Tzi-Liu-Jing, Szechuan Province</h2><p>There will be a few days of gospel meetings in the auditorium of the Ren-Ji Hospital starting May 19. There may be a few days of Bible study meetings afterwards. We work in the schools and in the homes during the day. In the future we will preach the gospel to the miners and in the markets. The door for the work is open wide. We deeply believe that God wants to work.</p><p>Chang Yu-zhi<br />May 18</p><h2 class="head2">Shi-Ping, Yunnan Province</h2><p>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord who are co-workers:</p><p>We would like to tell the brothers and sisters all that God has done through us according to the pattern of the apostles (Acts 14:27; 21:19). We would also like to tell how God opened the door of the gospel for us. First, we give all the glory to God. Second, we hope the brothers and sisters would know how to pray for us. Third, we want to let the brothers and sisters who are concerned about the work in the remote areas know where we have been and the condition of the work. We left Ku-Jiu on the eighteenth of last month and were led by the Lord to arrive safely in Shi-Ping. We had an edification conference for the brothers and sisters from the evening of the twentieth to the evening of the twenty-seventh. The attendants in the meetings were mainly sisters. (This is because there are only four or five brothers here, with many times that number of sisters.) Most of the people in the meeting cannot read, except for the students. It was slightly difficult. However, the Lord brought us through. It seemed that most of the audience received the word. May God do a deeper work within them that they may gain the life of Christ more richly. We went to the streets beside all the city gates every afternoon from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth to preach the gospel outdoors. The atmosphere was not very open. They have never welcomed Christianity. It was God's grace that we could openly bring the gospel to them. We borrowed the meeting hall for three gospel meetings on the afternoons of the twenty-fifth to the twenty-seventh. The brothers and sisters brought their friends and relatives to hear the gospel. We also saw God working. Some declared their faith in the Lord during the meeting. May the Lord gain them that they may not just be saved but may pay the price to walk in the way of victory to glorify the Lord's name. Amen!</p><p>The director of a certain newspaper was touched by the gospel he heard on the street. He made a special trip to visit us, and we had a long conversation with him. We also gave him some books on salvation. He later expressed that he had completely received the Lord. He is now reading the Bible and is coming to hear the messages. On the morning of the twenty-ninth, Brother K. H. Weigh and Brother Lin Kuang-tsao went to Lin-An and preached the gospel outdoors at the city gates and at every busy place in the city. Thank the Lord. Some people received the gospel on the spot. Some people were coming to the city from the countryside and had an excellent opportunity to hear the gospel. During the last gospel gathering, the Lord made a marvelous arrangement, and we met a brother in the Lord. When he saw us, he was happy to invite us into his home to stay there temporarily. Because the next day was the Lord's Day and we had a burden to hurry back to Shi-Ping, we did not accept his invitation. The Lord has begun a work in Lin-An. If He allows, Brother Lin will soon go there to continue preaching the gospel. Brother Weigh and Brother Chen Hsi-wen will leave tomorrow and go first to Mong-Tze and then to Kai-Yuan. Finally, they will go into K'un-ming. Brother Lin Kuang-tsao will continue to work in this region. He feels that the harvest is great and the workers few. He is often conscious of his inability and loneliness. May the Lord send one from among the co-workers with a burden for the gospel to the remote regions who will come to Shi-Ping and work with Brother Lin Kuang-tsao in all the localities in southern Yunnan. Brother Kuang-tsao feels that there is a desperate cry from this region and hopes that all the brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility to pray. In the church in Shi-Ping the majority of the brothers and sisters know that they must learn to follow the Lord and not look to man. The work that we have just finished needs your prayer as a follow-up. May the Lord's rich grace and great love be with you. Amen.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />K. H.
