The Lord desires to have many local churches, and this conference is a gathering of many churches. When the Lord gains a lampstand in a city, it is a real victory to the Lord and a real shame to the enemy; and when a number of the churches in different cities come together and are in one accord, it is a glory to the Lord.</P><P>The Lord's recovery is a matter of the local churches. For us to experience the Lord's recovery, we must be in the local churches. However, a single local church, a single lampstand, in a single city is not adequate to express the testimony of Christ, nor is it adequate for the fellowship. The testimony and fellowship of the church are something of the Body. These matters need all the churches. For this the churches need to be able to come together; they need to be clustered. Some may like to be alone and isolated, but this is wrong. The churches should be clustered, and the saints should be blended together. In the blending there is a great spiritual benefit and a mutual building up. This is something that belongs to the Body, to all the churches. The clustering of the churches also stirs up our mutuality. All the churches should be the same in fellowship, in the Lord's testimony, and in the building up. Also, when the churches are clustered together, there is a stronger testimony, and there are the impact and the encouragement. This is good for the impact of the gospel.</P><P>A local church is the God-called-out people gathered together in a locality&#151;a city, a town, or a village. The Body of Christ is one. According to Ephesians 4:4, there is one Body and one Spirit. Because both the Body and the Spirit are only one, there should be only one local church in every city. It is very simple: one city, one church. The New Testament is absolutely consistent on this point; there is no deviation (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 8:1; Gal. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11). In a given city, there should be only one church. This is similar to the divine principle that for one husband there should be only one wife.</P><P>However, the situation among Christians today is altogether different. In a small city of only fifty thousand people, there may be over one hundred different "churches," that is, different denominations. All these denominations are divisions. God ordained that in one city all the called-out ones should gather together as the one church, as the unique expression of the one Body of Christ in that locality. Some say that in a city where there are many thousands of believers, it would be impossible to have only one church. However, in Jerusalem there were myriads (ten thousands) of believers (Acts 21:20), but there was only one church (8:1). In Jerusalem three thousand were saved, baptized, and added to the church on the day of Pentecost (2:41), and shortly thereafter at least five thousand more were added (4:4). Still, there was only one church in Jerusalem.</P><P>In Romans 16:3-5a the apostle Paul greeted Prisca and Aquila and the church, which was in their house. The fact that the believers in Rome met in the home of Prisca and Aquila indicates that the number was small. However, although the number was small, they were still the one local church in Rome. The principle of "one city, one church" is God's way, to which we say Amen. The oneness of the Body should be expressed locally in every city. It is wrong to have divisions (1 Cor. 1:10). It is wrong to have the denominations. There should be just one church in a city.</P><P>Not only so, all the local churches should not be independent or isolated. They should not be locally a local sect. They should be blended. They should come together. We should not think that it is good enough merely to be in the local church in our city. We need to be in the churches, that is, in the Body.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
