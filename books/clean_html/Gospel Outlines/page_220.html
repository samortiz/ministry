CONCERNING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Thirty-five</h2>
<h1 class="title">GOD, THE DEVIL, THE SPIRIT OF MAN,<br />
AND THE SOUL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 1:20; John 8:44; 1 John 3:8; Matt. 16:26; Luke 12:20; 16:19-31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>There is a God</li>
<li>There is a Devil<br />
<span class="normal">Give examples of people being possessed by demons, speaking for demons, and performing demonic works. All of these have the devil as their source and sin as their consequence.</span></li>
<li>There is the spirit of man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Prove the existence of the human spirit by the human conscience. Although the conscience cannot be seen, everyone feels the effect of its working, and has to recognize its existence. The conscience is the main part of the spirit.</li>
	<li>Prove the existence of the human spirit by life. The difference between a dead person and a living one is life, and life is simply the spirit (Luke 8:55).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There is man&rsquo;s soul
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Show that there is a soul by using the illustration of love. Although it cannot be seen, love no doubt exists and is one of the functions of the soul.</li>
	<li>The death of a man also proves the existence of the soul. A man&rsquo;s death is simply the departure of his soul from his body. Although the body is still present, the man is said to have departed, meaning that the soul has left the body.</li>
	<li>Use the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16 to further substantiate that there is man&rsquo;s soul. While in Hades the rich man was able to recall things that had happened during his earthly life. Although his body was buried, it was his soul that was remembering his life on earth.</li>

<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Thirty-six</h2>
<h1 class="title">JESUS IS GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 1:1; 10:30; 14:9</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Jesus said that He is God<br />
<span class="normal">If you want to know who a man is, you have to ask him. Throughout history no philosopher, religious leader, or sage has dared to claim to be God. Only Jesus said that He is God.</span></li>
<li>His deeds prove that He is God<br />
<span class="normal">He performed miracles and spoke words of wisdom and life.</span></li>
<li>His disciples professed that He is God</li>
<li>The Bible says that He is God</li>
<li>The experience of the believers throughout the centuries confirms that He is God</li>

<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Thirty-seven</h2>
<h1 class="title">JESUS BECOMING MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16; 2:5</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The necessity of Jesus becoming a man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Being God Himself, He could not come near to man and contact man unless He were to become a man.</li>
	<li>Without becoming a man, He could not sympathize with man since He had not passed through man&rsquo;s experience.</li>
	<li>Without becoming a man, He could not bear the sins of man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The plausibility of Jesus becoming a man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If He could create man out of nothing, much more He could be conceived through a virgin.</li>
	<li>Since He established the law of human reproduction, He can establish another law of reproduction.</li>
	<li>Even science itself confirms this possibility.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The fact of Jesus becoming a man<br />
<span class="normal">Using the Bible for this section, show that He was conceived of a virgin, that He was born in a manger, and that the glad tidings of His birth were announced by the angels. <em>Develop this with other related facts.</em></span></li>
