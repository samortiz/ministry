<h2 class="head1">THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>For the remainder of this message, we need to present another major point of teaching concerning Christ. In chapter 2 we saw the divinity of Christ, and in chapter 4 we saw Christ in His relation to all things. Now we will look at the incarnation of Christ. A Christian must know the Lord in His incarnation more thoroughly than in any other matter because this is the turning point, the central point. All the points previously fellowshipped depend on this point, and all the subsequent points that we will fellowship come out of this point. In other words, everything that the Lord has done was either for His incarnation or depends upon His incarnation. Without His incarnation, the Lord would be meaningless to us. Hence, this point is central and crucial. We should present the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation to the young people from several vantage points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prophecy concerning Incarnation</h2>
<p>We should begin by speaking of the prophecy concerning the incarnation. In the Bible the prophecy concerning the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation is very clear, and it is recorded in numerous places, but we will consider only two verses. In Genesis 3:15, after man fell, God said to the serpent, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel.&rdquo; At first glance, the phrase <em>her seed,</em> that is, the woman&rsquo;s seed, seems quite simple, but the implications of it are very profound. First, God&rsquo;s speaking related to the seed of a woman coming forth clearly indicates the matter of birth. Second, this birth involves a human being, because the seed is of a woman. Third, the seed who would be born according to this prophecy would be different from every other person born in the world because they are the seed of a man rather than of a woman. The fact that this human seed is the seed of a woman indicates that this seed is different in both origin and nature. The seed of a man comes out of man; as such, its origin is of man, and it has the nature of man. However, the seed in this prophecy comes out of the seed of a woman; as such and by inference, His origin is of God, and He has the nature of God. Therefore, the simple phrase <em>her seed,</em> the seed of the woman, infers that God would come to be a man through incarnation. This is the first prophecy in the Bible concerning God&rsquo;s coming to be a man.</p>
<p>The second prophecy is in Isaiah 7:14, which says, &ldquo;The virgin will conceive and will bear a son.&rdquo; This verse closely follows the thought related to the seed of the woman, because the Son born of the virgin is the seed of the woman prophesied in Genesis 3:15. Christ is indeed the seed of the woman, because His birth involved only a woman, a human virgin. Isaiah 7:14 continues, saying, &ldquo;She will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; The name Immanuel means &ldquo;God with us,&rdquo; that is, God with man. This reveals the special source and particular nature of the woman&rsquo;s seed spoken of in Genesis 3. The Son born of the virgin was called God with man, indicating that He is God with man, God joined to man, God mingled with man. He has the element of humanity as well as the element of divinity. In His name God and man, man and God, are joined. Thus, the prophecy of God&rsquo;s coming to be a man, God&rsquo;s incarnation, is very clear.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Accomplishment of Incarnation</h2>
<p>The accomplishment of the prophecy of God&rsquo;s incarnation in the Old Testament is spoken of at the beginning of the New Testament. We will consider two portions. Matthew 1:20-23 says, &ldquo;An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph...do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins. Now all this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, &lsquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel&rsquo; (which is translated, God with us).&rdquo; This portion clearly tells us that the prophecy in the Old Testament has been fulfilled. A virgin was indeed with child, and her being with child was of the Holy Spirit, indicating that the source was the Holy Spirit, that is, God. The Son born of her would also be the Savior of sinners; that is, He would save us from our sins. Hence, His name was called Jesus, meaning &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior.&rdquo; <em>Jesus</em> is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name <em>Joshua</em> (Num. 13:16), which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Galatians 4:4 says, &ldquo;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law.&rdquo; This is God incarnated, the expression of God, the manifestation of God. The Son of God is God manifested. A son expresses his father. Hence, the Son of God is the expression of God; He is also God expressed. The expression of God was born of a woman and became a man; this is incarnation. The God who became flesh fulfilled the prophecy of incarnation.</p>
