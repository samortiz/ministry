   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ as Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter thirteen shows us Christ as love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tongues will cease, prophecies and knowledge will be rendered useless, but Christ as love never falls away v. 8 . He never fails, fades out, or comes to an end.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prophesying Builds Up the Church</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The main thing that chapter fourteen reveals is that prophesying builds up the church v. 4b .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No Legality in the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 31 Paul said, "You can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in 12:29 Paul said, "Are all prophets?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, chapter twelve indicates that we are not all prophets, but chapter fourteen says that we can all prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also, chapter eleven says that women can pray and prophesy v. 5 , but chapter fourteen says that the women have to be silent v. 34 . These varying portions of the Word show that we should not be legal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today is the age of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not make any practice a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his preface to The Normal Christian Church Life, Brother Watchman Nee said that he was afraid that people would take his book as a manual to make something legal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today is not the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the law everything is mentioned clearly and definitely with no room for discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in 1 Corinthians 11:34 Paul said, "The rest I will set in order when I come."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the apostle did not give instructions for everything related to the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For "the rest" we need to seek the Lord's leading, based on and governed by the principles set forth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul spoke to the Corinthians about division in chapters one and three, about a sinful brother in chapter five, about a lawsuit in chapter six, about idol worship in chapter eight, and about head covering and the Lord's table in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Paul did not tell them everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the apostle Paul could not come to us, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul cannot come, but the Lord is here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If some say that we all have to pray-read, they have made pray-reading a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If others say that we should not pray-read, they have made this a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nothing is right as long as it is a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When anything becomes a legality, that brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should say, "Lord, we thank You that You have not told us everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We thank You that we have to open to You all the time."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Should we have a piano or an organ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Should we have a hymnal?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not make anything a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we would never be legal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are legal with anything, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1 Timothy 2 Paul told the sisters that they should dress in modest apparel v. 9 . We cannot define the standard of modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How modest is modest?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who can make the decision to set the standard?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, the revelation of the Bible is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, we need the living Spirit to guide us into the reality of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With the law there was no room for debate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the New Testament many details are left up to the inner leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, things concerning idol worship, heresy, and immorality are not debatable, but things concerning forms and practices should not be legal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How long should our meetings be and at what time should they be?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible does not tell us these things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why Paul said, "The rest I will set in order when I come."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With so many questions and problems, we have to look to the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should say, "Lord, we cannot find any regulation in Your Word, but You are the living Word."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need a living contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to take all the regulations and instructions of the New Testament in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The letter of the Old Testament and of the New Testament is killing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the Spirit who gives life 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
