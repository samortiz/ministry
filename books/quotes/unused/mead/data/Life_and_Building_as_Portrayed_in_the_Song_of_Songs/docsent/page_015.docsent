   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S APPRAISAL OF THE SEEKING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to see a little more in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In all of the above verses, the Lord Jesus appraised the seeking one in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Company of Horses in Pharaoh's Chariots</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first appraisal is in 1:9: "I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The horses here signify our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She is so powerful, but natural and worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had the strength that belongs to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some are so strong and powerful, but in a natural and worldly way, like a horse in Pharaoh's chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Doves' Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then in verse 15 of chapter one, the Lord speaks of the eyes of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now the seeking one is making some improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When she first sought the Lord, she was as strong as a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But now she has gradually learned to look upon the Lord with doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Lily</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After this, the Lord likened her to a lily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters" 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord speaks of a lily in Matthew 6 as one who lives on this earth, not trusting in his own strength, but upon God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At first she was as strong as a horse, naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, now she no longer trusts in her natural strength, but she trusts in the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She is just a lily trusting the Lord for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Dove</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From a lily, the seeking one continues to improve to become a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely" 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First of all she only had doves' eyes, but now she is a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Which is more powerful, a horse or a dove?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And which would you rather be?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that most of us would like to be a horse that is so powerful and full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A dove is small and not so powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But to go on from a horse to a dove is a real improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that in the local churches there will be many doves and not so many horses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am afraid that there are too many horses in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of the horses must be transformed into doves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible the dove is the sign of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord was baptized, the Spirit descended upon Him like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are really in the spirit and one with the Spirit, we will be like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There will be the real improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Pillar of Smoke, a Couch, and a Palanquin</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Between the dove and the next stage, there is a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not know how long a time it takes, but I do know that this period of time between Song of Songs 2:14 and 3:6 is not short.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here we see something wonderful: "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the powders of the merchant?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Behold his bed couch , which is Solomon's; King Solomon made himself a chariot palanquin of the wood of Lebanon" 3:6-7a, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a change in the seeking one!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now she comes up from the wilderness, not as a horse, neither as a dove, but as a pillar of smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is smoke, yet it is a pillar, something so solid.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who is this one perfumed with myrrh and frankincense and with all the perfumes of the merchant?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The question was asked about her, but the answer is made concerning King Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is Solomon's couch, a place of rest during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The seeking one has improved so much that now she has become the Lord's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She is Solomon's resting place, and she is Solomon's chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "chariot" is not the best translation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The best translation is the word "palanquin."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a carriage which is carried by men for traveling during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The couch is for resting at night, and the palanquin is for moving during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She is the resting place of Jesus and the moving carriage of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is really quite deep.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is far more than just the banqueting house.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not the shade of the apple tree, but the couch of Solomon and the carriage of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She is just the resting place of Jesus, and she is the carriage of Jesus for His move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She has become the very expression of Jesus, and by this expression Jesus moves on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During the night, she is His resting place, and during the day, she is His very expression for His move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now she has really learned to take the Lord as her life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His personality is now her personality, and His expression is her expression.</S>
