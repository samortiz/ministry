   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SUBJECTIVE OBSTACLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENCOUNTERED BY GOD S LIFE IN US Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2; Phil 2:5, 13; 2 Thes 3:5 FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF OBSTACLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we saw four different obstacles that God s life encounters in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although these four problems are in us, relatively speaking, they are objective rather than subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we need to see four additional obstacles that God s life encounters in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These four obstacles are not only in us, but they are also very subjective in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are not like the four previous obstacles which are mainly outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, some people have difficulty with some aspect of their behavior and actions, but these problems are mainly outward and objective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, there are some obstacles that God s life encounters in us that are more subjective and intrinsic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE LIFE OF GOD BEING MINGLED WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to understand that God s life does not come into us to be our life in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, God s life does not nullify our person in order to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, God s life comes into us to mingle with us and be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, He still needs our person, and our person continues to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God does not become our life by putting us aside and eliminating our person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not what God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although God s life becomes our life, God still wants our person to exist because He needs our person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s purpose is to mingle with our person; His desire is to be mingled with us as one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, tea begins as water inside a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the element of tea is added to the water, it becomes tea.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean, however, that there are only tea leaves and no water in the tea; the tea leaves are mingled with the water, and the water becomes tea.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The water and the tea become one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though we were originally only human, God s life has come into us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean that our person has ceased to exist and that only God s life is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some people correctly think that before they were saved, they did not have God s life but then incorrectly assume that God s life replaced their human life after their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In their understanding, these are two successive events, but this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we are saved and regenerated, God s life is mingled with our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the first stage of our human life, we have only the human life, not God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After we are saved, God s life comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, God s life wants to be our life; on the other hand, our personal life still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s life has not replaced our life but has mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, we are not merely a man but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This can be compared to a cup of tea, which is no longer merely water but rather both tea and water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the element of tea is added into water, it becomes tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As saved ones, we are no longer simply human; we are humans mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we said to an unbelieving friend, You are not merely human, this would sound like an insult to him, and he would feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, this is a very practical word to Christians because it is exceedingly precious and sweet when God s life comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>AND THE OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After God s life comes into us, we are no longer merely human; we also have God s life and God s element.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can say that we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are no longer merely men, but we are men mingled with God; we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, even though God is mingled with us, are we willing to cooperate with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a popular game in elementary school called a three-legged race.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who participate in the game form a team of two students, and one leg of each student is tied together so that the two must walk on three legs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both of the students have to walk together in one accord to a destination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the end, the ones who run the best are the teams that have the best mutual understanding and the ability to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, it often does not matter if they run slowly, because winning in a three-legged race does not depend on speed as much as it does on not tripping and falling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, if a team can run faster, that is even better.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But it is dreadful when a fast student and a slow student cannot coordinate together and soon fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once they fall, the race is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the team that typically wins the final victory is made up of two people with similar disposition, pace, view, and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since they run as one person, they are able to win.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before we were saved, we were only one person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After we were saved, God came into us, and now He wants to live with us as if we were in a three-legged race.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wants us to cooperate with Him and move with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is at this point that problems begin to arise, because we lived entirely by ourselves before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We did whatever we wanted to do, loved whatever we wanted to love, and chose whatever we wanted to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everything was our own personal matter, and we made decisions entirely by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even though we outwardly seem to be the same as we were before our salvation, many of us can testify that now there are two persons in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, when we decide to do something, another person in us disagrees.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I believe that we have all had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It often seems that Someone in us wants us to do a certain thing, but our outer man disagrees.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In such a situation, we clearly sense that there are two persons in us one inside and one outside.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This can be compared to a Chinese two-man comic show.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ed. note: In this type of show, one person acts according to what a person hiding behind him is speaking or singing .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>During the performance, if I am the person hiding behind the person in the front, I may say, Bend at the waist, and he will bend at the waist.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If I say, Move your head, he will move his head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To perform a two-man comic show well, the person hiding in the back and the person in front must act in unison.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If they do not perform in unison, the audience will easily see that they are not performing together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The living of a genuine Christian can be compared to a two-man comic show.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is a person in a Christian who causes him to cry or laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nevertheless, there are times when the One in us is sad, but we are laughing on the outside, or we may be sad, but He is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He may want to do a certain thing, but we want to do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then we clearly sense that there is one person on the outside and another person on the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every genuine Christian can testify that he is not a normal Christian when his living within and without are in contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God may want him to go east, but he wants to go west.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If so, his outer person is not one with his inner person, and he is not a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In other words, he may be a genuine Christian, but his living is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Under normal circumstances, he should be one person, both within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When God is happy in him, he is happy; when God is sad in him, he is sad; and when God gives a command, he immediately follows.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>His entire person corresponds with God completely.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This kind of Christian is not only a genuine Christian but also a normal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This kind of Christian is consistent within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Consequently, he will be joyful and peaceful within.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When he prays, he is filled with God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He can act in perfect unison with God as if he were in a two-man comic show.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Whenever God moves, he moves; whenever God urges him to speak, he speaks with one voice, and the words that God speaks within, he speaks outside.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Whatever God shines in him, he shines forth the same light on the outside; whatever leading God gives him within, he follows this leading on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He is in perfect harmony with God, and he can cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the normal Christian living of a normal Christian.</S>
