THE CENTRAL VISION OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Whether the condition of the church has been high or low over the past twenty years, we have always been on a central line. For example, in recent years we have stressed that we must not rely on doctrine and knowledge and that, instead, we should turn to our spirit. However, there has been a lack in our experience of turning to the spirit because there has been a lack of response from the co-workers. This procrastination has brought us close to the point of death. We should not be concerned whether the goods are &ldquo;firsthand&rdquo; or &ldquo;secondhand,&rdquo; as long as they contain the riches. We do not need new tricks in our speaking. Even if we could come up with something &ldquo;new,&rdquo; what would be the benefit? The church, as the new man, is produced only with Christ as life; hence, to live by Christ is our true need.</p>
<p>What is the benefit of speaking different messages? There is an abundant source of supply in the ministry of the Word for the saints to gain Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ. In Philippians 3 Paul says that he pursued but that he dared not say he had already obtained (vv. 12, 14). He counted all things as refuse in order to gain Christ (v. 8). We must see the vision of Christ and take Him as our center in our work and living. We are not just dealing with doctrines but living by Christ in our daily living. This is what God desires. Our problem is that we have not entered into such a living, despite what we have seen and heard. Being able to lead others based only on our past godly accomplishments shows that we have not entered into the central vision of God. We must see the central vision of God, which is to enjoy Christ, to live by Him, and to take Him as our goal in our living and service.</p>
<p>Many of the co-workers, who have served in various places for many years, still do not know this vision or how to carry out this vision. Using tricks in our messages is of no use. Rather, we need to know and study the vision that we have been given. Christ and the church are the central vision. If we explore it thoroughly, enjoy its riches, and experience it deeply, we will be on the right track. None of us are qualified to say that we have explored this matter fully, because we have not entered practically into what we have seen. For this reason, we must endeavor to enter into what we have seen and then take a further step to see even more. We must know the basic matters and then advance. If we are studying mathematics, for example, we first must know basic arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division before we can advance. Preachers throughout the history of Christianity have not been able to produce anything of much value because they did not see or follow the central vision in the Bible, the vision of Christ and the church. If we see this vision and work according to it, something of value will be produced. However, if we do not see it or are not willing to practice it, nothing of value will be produced no matter how much we &ldquo;sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others can be excused if they have not seen or heard the vision, but we cannot be excused. The riches of the Lord are here for us to enjoy. If I were leading the church in Taipei, I could lead the saints for a year just on the matter of singing hymns. I would spend an entire week on <em>Hymns,</em> #499, which says, &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace! / The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives,&rdquo; until the saints know that both Christ and life are in them. The hymns cannot be exhausted by singing them or by speaking of them in a light way; they are too rich. Furthermore, we also can speak concerning Christ and life from the Bible.</p>
<p>We should not depend on tricks in serving the church; such tricks are irrelevant because they cannot satisfy people&rsquo;s hunger or quench their thirst. We must speak continually concerning Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church; we must express this burden from the beginning to the end of the year. It may be that not every saint will want to pursue the real thing, but at least half will be attracted to these riches. We do not need to give messages that do not matter in order to accommodate those who do not care; if we do this, we will only gain people who do not care. If we want to gain people who care, we must give messages that matter, messages that show the meaning of life, that is, Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church. If we speak of these things in a thorough way, we will attract some weighty people into the church life. Our center and goal are Christ and the church, but our work and testimony in the churches today have lost this center and goal. We cannot let this condition continue; otherwise, we will become even more desolate.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
