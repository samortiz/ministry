<h2 class="head2">Chou County, Shantung Province</h2><p>After receiving and reading Issue Nos. 3 and 4 of The Open Door, we learned about the condition of the work in all the places in China and about the travels of the brothers and sisters. We really thank and praise our God! The brothers and sisters here were scattered into the countryside three months ago. We have passed through all kinds of dangers in the past one hundred days, but we thank our God for leading us through safely. No one was lost. We are unable to meet publicly now. We preach the gospel individually and meet in homes. Please pray for us. Although we are living in the country, we can still go into the city to pick up letters at the post office.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Liu Tien-min, Chen Bo-heng<br />April 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tai-An, Shantung Province</h2><p>Peace to the dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord! He has really led me beside the still waters and made me to fear no evil, though I have passed through the valley of death. Although I lost my job in the past six months, I do not have any material shortage. Once some bandits tried to take my life when I was out in the countryside, but God protected me. They could not find me. Praise the Lord! God has led me to work in the Buo-Ji Hospital in Tai-An. There are brothers and sisters here in one accord with us. However, we still do not have a suitable place to meet. I believe that God will arrange it. Please pray for us. May Christ's name be exalted here soon. Blessing, glory, and riches to Him. Amen.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Wang Yong-hai<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Fu-Ping, Shensi Province</h2><p>To Brother You-sheng, my co-inheritor of grace:</p><p>It has been almost a year since we said good-by to each other. Although I have passed through many dangers and travels, I have gained peace and protection in the Lord. May glory and praise be to our Father forever and ever. When I first came to work in this hospital, no one who worked here believed in the Lord. There are nine believers now. Some had heard the gospel before. Some have just been saved recently. They all desire the Lord's truth. We have a prayer meeting every night to learn how to love the Lord. Some have gained much benefit and strength from this meeting. We have a Bible study every Lord's Day evening. We also allow unbelievers to attend that meeting. We still do not have a meeting to break bread and remember the Lord. Although we feel that we need to establish the table, there is a great Power that has been saying to us, "Wait awhile, it is not time yet." This matter really needs the Lord's light. (If you want to establish the Lord's table, you must first understand the nature and realm of a local church. Please read The Normal Christian Church Life concerning this point&mdash;Editor.) We will soon have a baptism meeting. We are looking for a place to baptize people and are waiting for the Lord's arrangement in everything. There is a denomination here that has been established for almost forty years. There is only one lukewarm believer in it. The churches in the countryside are very good. In one locality a believer, who only had twenty plots of land and had six or seven members in his family, gave an offering of six hundred dollars to build a meeting hall. We should admire such lovers of the Lord. If the Lord allows, I hope to travel to Hankow soon. I am still waiting for the Lord's leading. I have received every issue of The Open Door and was comforted much by it. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Li Ching-hua<br />May 12<br />[Address omitted]</p>
