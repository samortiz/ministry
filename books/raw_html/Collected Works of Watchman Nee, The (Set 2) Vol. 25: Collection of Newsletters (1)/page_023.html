<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings in love to Sister Ruth Lee:</P><P>After we left you, we boarded the steamer at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon. The boat left port at 9:00 p.m. We were protected by our heavenly Father. The winds and waves were calm. The way was safe. I was afraid you would worry about us, so I am writing to let you know that we are safe. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>We had originally decided to return immediately to Tai Sun. However, we were pressed for time, and with the coming of winter, we were afraid there would be many inconveniences along the way. If we were not careful, problems could arise, so we were forced to stay at Lu Pien in Yi Shan, P'ing Yang until after the Chinese New Year. The brothers and sisters who meet in Lu Pien asked us to stay because they hope to have a sisters' meeting in the first month of the Chinese calendar. We are now praying for this matter. Please ask the sisters in Shanghai to pray with us also. We hope this meeting glorifies the Lord's name and causes the Father's eternal plan to be carried out in us. We also hope the enemy suffers loss and that we are built up. This is our news. May the Lord bless you with peace.</P><P>Lin Hsiang and Bao Jen Shen<br>February 9, 1934</P><P>P.S. Please greet all the sisters. Especially greet the household of Mrs. Wang.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM KWANGCHOW, KWANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>To our dear sisters in the Lord, Miss Lee and Miss Chang:</P><P>After leaving on the evening of the seventh, our boat left on the eighth. Everything on the boat was covered by the Lord. Although we were slightly seasick, the Lord's grace was sufficient for us. So we are well. We arrived in Kwangchow on the morning of the thirteenth. Please do not worry about us. Please thank the Lord for His grace in protecting us and giving us a safe journey to the conference and home from it.</P><P>We received much light from this trip to Shanghai. Our hearts give much thanks to the Lord! We also want to thank you for your diligent hospitality! We hope the Lord remembers your love when He is giving rewards. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>We are still in Kwangchow now. We still do not know when we will return to Tai Shan. When we have arrived in Tai Shan, we will let you know. We bless you with peace in the Lord. Greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord for us.</P><P>Your sisters in the Lord,<br>Lin Wei Shih and Lei Mei Hsiung<br>February 14, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM CHEFOO, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Brother Yueh Chiao:</P><P>The brothers and sisters and I arrived in Tsingtao on the morning of the eighth. Brothers Yuan Chin Chou and Chang Tze Chieh went ashore there. We arrived in Chefoo on the morning of the ninth. We went ashore at 10:30 a.m. We left Brother Chu Teh Yao on the ship alone to continue on to Tientsin. We thank the Lord for keeping us all safe along the way! Peace be to you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Witness Lee<br>February 12, 1934</P>
