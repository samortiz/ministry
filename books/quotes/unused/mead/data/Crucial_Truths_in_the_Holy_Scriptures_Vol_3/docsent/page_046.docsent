   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Matter of Partnerships</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers 2 Cor 6:14; see also Deut 22:10; 2 Chron 20:35-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Believers may not form business partnerships with unbelievers because God s Word says that believers should not be dissimilarly yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as God does not allow an ox and a donkey to be yoked together to plow the field, He does not allow a believer to form business partnerships with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the dispositions, interests, and human goals of a believer and an unbeliever are completely different, it is difficult for a believer to practice the will of God and avoid being contaminated and affected by such a dissimilar relationship, causing him to offend God and withdraw from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God cannot bless such a partnership.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the benefit of the believer, He will usually destroy it in His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A good example of this kind of discipling can be seen in the case of Jehoshaphat, who formed a partnership to build ships with Ahaziah, who did not want God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though Jehoshaphat was a God-seeker, God destroyed the ships that were built.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What to Do with Profit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have something to share with him who has need Eph 4:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When believers have a job or a business, they should not hoard their money but should share with brothers and sisters who have need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hoarding causes us to suffer loss; sharing causes us to have a reward and brings in more of God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul worked to supply not only his own needs but also the needs of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows that when a believer works, his work is not only for his own living but also for God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, when he makes a profit, he should supply God s work and God s workers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every believer who loves the Lord and lives to the Lord loves to do this and should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a believer keeps his profit and allows the work of God to suffer loss and difficulty, he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May the Lord have mercy on us and save us.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?...Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 Cor 6:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first principle in the matter of making friends is that believers may not make friends with unbelievers.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The nature, use, and owner of a believer and unbeliever are completely opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we must be separated from them.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second principle related to believers making of friends is not to have evil companionships.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While we cannot be friends with unbelievers, we must be careful and not make friends loosely even with a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we make friends loosely without discernment, it will be difficult to avoid evil influences; thus, we can corrupt ourselves and suffer loss.</S>
