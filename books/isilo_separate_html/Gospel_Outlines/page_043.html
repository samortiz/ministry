<h1 class="title">THOUGH AS SCARLET, WHITE AS SNOW</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Isa. 1:18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Sins are like scarlet
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All men have sin.</li>
	<li>All the sins of men are deep and serious.</li>
	<li>The sins of men are deep and serious to such an extent that they are like scarlet, which is a very bright red color that draws people&rsquo;s attention. Many people&rsquo;s sins are also like this; they are so deep and serious that they draw people&rsquo;s attention.</li>
	<li>The color red represents God&rsquo;s condemnation. The color that symbolizes godliness is blue. Red is the color that symbolizes something satanic. In the Scriptures, red is the color of blood, which is the color of death. Therefore, when the Bible says that your sins are as scarlet, it not only refers to how deeply serious your sins are, but it also signifies that sins are hated by God and ought to be terminated.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>They shall be as white as snow
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Snow white is a kind of natural white, rather than an artificial or a manufactured white.</li>
	<li>How can sins become as white as snow? They can become white only by the cleansing of the blood. The blood is red, and by using red to eliminate red, it becomes snow white. If you look at a piece of red paper through a red glass, the red paper becomes white.</li>
	<li>The blood of the Lord can wash sins away and make them pure white because the blood of the Lord satisfies the righteous requirement of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to become pure white
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>You must confess that you are a sinner.</li>
	<li>You must repent and confess your sins.</li>
	<li>You must believe that Christ has shed His blood and borne your sins on the cross.</li>
	<li>You must receive Christ as your Savior.</li>
	<li>You must believe what is written in Isaiah 1:18, because the Lord has said, &ldquo;Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
