My God I dare<br />Once more to fling myself upon Thy breast,<br />And there adore Thy ways in faith's deep rest,<br />And there adore Thy ways in faith's quiet rest.</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="head1">HYMN NO. 131</h2><h2 class="head2">8.7.8.7.D. (Hymns, #628)</h2><p>Via Bethlehem we journey,<br />We whose hearts on God are set;<br />Babelike souls of Jesus learning,<br />While our cheeks with tears are wet;<br />For the manger and the stable<br />Are not pleasant to our eyes,<br />But our feet must follow Jesus,<br />If our hands would grasp the prize.<br /><br />Via Nazareth! the pathway<br />Narrows still as on we go,<br />Years of toil none understanding,<br />Yet God teaches us to know<br />That the servant is not greater<br />Than the Lord, who through long years<br />Hid Himself from this world's glory,<br />Follow Him! Count not the tears.<br /><br />Via Galilee, we see Him!<br />Stones are hurled, and curses hissed<br />By the men who gather round Him,<br />Has He not the pathway missed?<br />No! unharmed the Savior passes,<br />And this rough bit of the way<br />We must travel, since like Jesus,<br />Nothing can our purpose stay.<br /><br />Via too, the awful anguish<br />Of the hours beneath the trees,<br />Where the hosts of Satan linger,<br />Awful hours of anguish these!<br />Yet we fail not, for God's angels<br />Minister to us, and say,<br />"Look, beloved, at the glory,<br />Conflict is but for a day!"<br /><br />Then the Cross! for via Calvary<br />Every royal soul must go;<br />Here we draw the veil, for Jesus<br />Only can the pathway show;<br />"If we suffer with Him," listen,<br />Just a little, little while,<br />And the memory will have faded<br />In the glory of His smile!<br /><br />Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,<br />Knowing that all life has fled;<br />(Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered<br />With the men the world calls dead?)<br />Thence we rise, and live with Jesus,<br />Throned above the world's mad strife,<br />Gladly forfeiting forever,<br />All that worldlings count as life.<br /><br />On we press! and yonder gleaming,<br />Nearing every day, we see<br />The great walls of that fair city,<br />God has built for such as we;<br />And we catch the tender music<br />Of the choirs that sing of One<br />Who once died to have us with Him<br />In His kingdom, on the throne.<br /><br />Just a few more miles, beloved!<br />And our feet shall ache no more;<br />No more sin, and no more sorrow,<br />Hush thee, Jesus went before;<br />And I hear Him sweetly whispering,<br />"Faint not, fear not, still press on,<br />For it may be ere tomorrow,<br />The long journey will be done."</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></div>
