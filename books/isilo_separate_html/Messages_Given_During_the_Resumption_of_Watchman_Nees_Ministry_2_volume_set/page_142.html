But it does not matter how much an earthen vessel is improved, for improvement only produces one result: to draw others' attention to itself. The ministry of Paul was quite extraordinary in its manifestation. Paul himself, however, was quite an ordinary person. Today, men do not have a strong ministry, yet they themselves are strong. We need to learn the lessons before God, to be smitten and dealt with by Him. What we need today is not outward human endeavors or any work of improvement. Our problem lies in the fact that we do not know how to differentiate between the outward earthen vessel and the inward treasure.</P><P>Miss Barber was a person who truly waited for the Lord's return. She waited daily and yearly. Hymns, #377, is a deep hymn and was written by her. It shows the kind of person she was. Whenever a person came into her presence, that one would sense Christ. She was a person who earnestly waited for the Lord's return. One day, I went into her study room and found her wastebasket filled with wastepapers. She told me that she was working on a letter that morning, and that before she finished it, she felt something wrong within and had to throw the letter away. After this she wrote a second one, only to find that she did not have the peace either, and she had to throw that one away also. In this way, she filled up her wastebasket with wastepapers, and the letter was still not finished. This little incident proves that she was a person who lived in the presence of the Lord.</P><P>Outward godliness cannot help a person to become a good Christian. Only that part which the Lord has wrought into us counts, and only that part is worthwhile. It is useless to try to be a Christian in an outward way; a person has to drop all such endeavors. A Christian is one who learns to live in an inward way, and not by any outward means. Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the death of Jesus. This death of Jesus is the killing of Jesus (2 Cor. 4:10). This killing is not an outward killing, but an inward one.</P><P>We must never lead the brothers and sisters into the wrong way. We must not be like the Catholics, who teach people to imitate the conduct of their "saints." To do this is useless as far as helping anyone to know God is concerned. Where there is an imitation, reality will not come. As long as anything artificial remains, nothing out of God can come in. The imitation things must go away before the real things will come. The greatest principle today is the principle of the treasure in the earthen vessel. Never waste time to improve yourself. It is wrong to indulge oneself, but it is equally wrong to improve oneself. God has no intention for us to improve our earthen vessels. His intention is for the treasure to be expressed through the earthen vessel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Pretending or Imitating</H2><P>Many people do not realize how much they make pretensions and imitations before men. One year during Christmas, Brother T. Austin-Sparks was lying on the lawn playing with his son and his dog. That was a most unpretending and beautiful picture. Many people seem to have burnt-up earthen vessels; they appear unnatural to others and give others an uneasy feeling. No one can remain in their presence for more than three minutes. Some act in such a way that even their voices change and their speaking becomes different. None of these outward pretensions will accomplish anything.</P><P>The goal of Christ's salvation is to manifest Christ before men. It is to present the Lord within to others. We are not drawing others' attention to the earthen vessels. If we do this, it will only damage ourselves. We are drawing others' attention to the Christ within us. Only He is the treasure. When the Son of Man came, He ate and drank (Matt. 11:19), but the principle some practice today is not to eat or drink. Man always thinks that in order to be spiritual, he has to be somewhat extraordinary or mysterious. A prophet has no honor in his own country (John 4:44) because he is no longer mysterious. When men knew the Lord's brothers and sisters, they did not respect Him (Matt. 13:54-58).</P><P>However, the real ministry is inward. God can do a deep work in a man, and yet at the same time that person can still be a very approachable person. Evan Hopkins was a leader in the Keswick movement. He specialized in the teaching of sanctification by consecration. He had the talent of drawing rabbits' ears. Often he drew all kinds of rabbits' ears for his children and grandchildren. Humanly speaking, this was not spiritual at all. Yet God used him to spread the teaching of sanctification. God did not send the angels to preach the teaching of sanctification; He used ordinary men to preach such words. In the Gospels, the Lord taught the disciples to turn and become as little children (Matt. 18:3; Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17). A child never pretends. We should never pretend to be what we are not. All pretending Christians are those who cry for help in private. They say to themselves, "What a suffering and burden it is to be a Christian!" Even bystanders would feel sorry for them. God does not want us to be this kind of Christian. A Christian is not one who forces himself to behave in a certain kind of way.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_141.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_143.html">Next</a> </body></html>
