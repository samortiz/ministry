   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT TALKS 3 Date: Afternoon, November 5, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Unrecorded MAN BEING THE ISSUE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created man from the dust of the earth as a vessel to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that His life must shine out of man like a light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The appearance of a lamp is not crucial, but it is crucial for light to shine out from it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some love to speak, while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But whether one is talkative or quiet, he has to afford the light the chance to shine out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as some people speak in the meeting, others say, "There he goes again!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That one's speaking is not the shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people pretend to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They may appear very nice outwardly, but a person's daily walk is something that cannot be faked.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to have the shedding of the blood, there must first be wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hebrews 9:22 speaks of the "shedding of blood."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not only the blood, but the shedding of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Christ was living on earth, His body had blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He was crucified and pierced on the cross, His blood was shed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By shedding His blood, the Lord was able to forgive man's sin and supply man with life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people are nice and have earned praises.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others look at them and consider them to be wonderful, but the cross has not inflicted any wound on them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have not shed any blood and therefore have nothing to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cross brings in dealings and wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such wounds become outlets for the supply to flow to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God inflicts us with the cross because He wants to break us, increase our measure, and expand the capacity of our spirit to match His life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1927 I was introduced by Miss Shi to a cardiologist.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He took an x-ray of me and said that there were problems with my heart and lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My heart was abnormal; it was too small.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said that it would be all right if my heart was in a smaller body, but that it was too small for a person as tall as me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The heart of a normal person must match the size of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same is true with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God wants our spirit to be large enough to match His work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is not afraid of our wisdom or ability; He is much greater than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He wants to see a spirit that is large enough to match our ability, wisdom, and personality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people accomplish something and say, "I have done this!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But a different person may say, "The Lord has done this!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When some people speak, it is themselves who are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When others speak, it is God who is speaking within them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Still others speak very little and spend half of their time sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No matter what condition a person is in, his spirit will not be the same after he has been dealt with by the Lord, even though his actions and words may still be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We often say that we have to deal with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But what should be the extent of the cross's dealing?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The cross must operate to the point that our spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me tell you a little story about Brother T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is not a skillful host at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you ask him to be a host, you have found the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He does not speak much, and if you sit down with him for half an hour or even an hour and a half, you may only hear the ticking of the clock on the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although you cannot hear anything from his mouth, you can sense his spirit and feel the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The cross is an open wound.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When your blood flows out of the wound, others will touch your spirit and touch God's life through you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God deals with men, but the dealings do not make them abnormal; the dealings merely enable God's life to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you have the opportunity to get close to Brother Austin-Sparks, you will sense immediately that he is a person with a big spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people preach in an ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You know that you can say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when they utter these seemingly ordinary words, others touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people stand up to pray, and all the brothers and sisters can say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Their prayers touch the inner being of others, who can sense that a strong spirit is present in these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, when other people stand up to pray, at the same time others pray for the Lord to shorten those prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One brother sat through a sermon and afterwards reported to others, saying, "The teaching today was good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The doctrine was absolutely right."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But doctrines can only convey knowledge to others; they cannot supply others with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Right doctrines or good expositions cannot touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their spirit must be touched by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who take the way of the cross do not need to think too much.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Just because we have thought something through does not mean that we truly have worked it out.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The problems of many people are problems of the mind; they are not spiritual problems.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even if we can solve all the problems in our mind, we may still not be able to grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is no need to deal with these kinds of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All we have to do is to stop our thoughts, jump over this spiritual hurdle, and we will grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who have a problem with their mind mostly do not have any reality in life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should remove all considerations of creed, knowledge, and intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God created everything in six days, and then He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It should only take God a very short time to deal with man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If it takes a long time, the procrastination is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, God has His timing in dealing with men.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But I must say that when God deals with man, it is primarily man who delays God's time and his own time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to drop all theological debates and accept God's dealing in a simple way.</S>
