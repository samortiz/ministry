   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Present Peter as a Hero</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, Luke s narration in 12:1-24 makes Peter a hero.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Christian hero suffered persecution both from the Jewish religion and from Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This leaves us with a very positive impression concerning Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we read chapter twelve, we receive the impression that Peter was a hero.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 12:5b-19a we see that Peter was rescued by the Lord in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Herod exercised his authority to put Peter into the inner prison, where he was chained to two guards, one on his right and the other on his left.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Herod was waiting until after the Passover to bring Peter out to the Jewish people v. 4 , for he thought that this would be very pleasing to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping in that night between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards before the door were keeping the prison.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell; and striking Peter s side, he roused him, saying, Rise up quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And the chains fell off his hands vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As Peter went out and followed the angel, he did not know that what was taking place through the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision v. 9 . The angel led Peter past the guards and through an iron gate, which opened of itself to them; and going out they went forward one lane; and immediately the angel departed from him v. 10 . Then Peter realized that what was happening to him was not a vision but was real.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter came to himself and said, Now I surely know that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me out of Herod s hand and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And when he became aware of this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was surnamed Mark, where a considerable number were assembled together praying vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a maiden named Rhoda recognized Peter s voice and reported to those in the house that Peter was standing before the entry, they said, It is his angel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only Peter as an apostle had an angel; even the little ones among the believers have their angels Matt 18:10 , who are servants to the believers who inherit God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, when those in the house saw Peter, they were amazed v. 16 . Motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison, and said, Report these things to James and the brothers v. 17 . This indicates that James was a leader among the apostles and elders in Jerusalem see 15:13; 21:18; Gal 1:19; 2:9, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 12:18-19b say, Now when it became day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And when Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything was ready for Peter to be brought out of prison and presented to the people, with one exception the prisoner had disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a shame that was to Herod!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Herod was angry and commanded that the guards be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although Herod was shamed by Peter s rescue from prison, he was still arrogant, and he still uplifted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are told that he was furious with the Tyrians and Sidonians; and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country was fed by the king s country v. 20 . Because Herod s country was rich and supplied food to Tyre and Sidon, the people there were afraid of Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were concerned that their supply of food would be cut off, and they did something to please Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On an appointed day Herod, having arrayed himself in royal clothing, sat on the judgment seat and made an oration to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And the populace cried out, The voice of a god and not of a man!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And instantly an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give the glory to God; and he was eaten by worms and expired vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It seems that Herod did not die immediately when the angel of the Lord struck him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, this arrogant, God-insulting person was eaten by worms.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The account of Herod s fate recorded in 12:19b-23 is related to Peter s suffering and to his being presented as a hero.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that Luke s intention in inserting this section into the narrative is to keep us from having a negative impression of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, our impression of him should be very positive, for the record concerning him and his ministry ends with such a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This confirms the fact that even though Peter s ministry was waning, the Lord was still with him and for him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the account regarding Peter ends in a heroic way, we should never depreciate Peter or his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although we do not agree with the Roman Catholic Church in uplifting Peter as a pope, we recognize that he and his ministry were very good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The record of his ministry is the record of a hero approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we should not uplift Paul and depreciate Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do this, we are like the Corinthians, for we shall be saying that we are of Paul and not of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because Peter was truly a hero in the Lord s move, we need to respect him.</S>
