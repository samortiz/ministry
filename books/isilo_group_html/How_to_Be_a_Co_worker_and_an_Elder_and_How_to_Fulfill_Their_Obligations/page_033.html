As a Co-worker, Never Consider That You Are above the Elders and Never Attempt to Appoint Elders</H2><P>As a co-worker, you should never consider that you are above the elders and never attempt to appoint elders; appointing elders requires maturity in life, being adequately equipped with the truth, and not being too young in physical age.</P><P>According to the holy Scriptures, apostles are co-workers, and it is the apostles who appoint elders. Therefore, some young co-workers consider themselves apostles above the elders. This kind of consideration is wrong and absurd. In fact, not everyone who is called a co-worker can appoint elders. I know definitely that some co-workers went to certain localities and attempted to appoint elders there but were rejected by the local people. It is neither fitting nor proper for one to attempt to appoint elders simply because he has become a co-worker. To appoint elders requires maturity in life and adequate equipping in truth.</P><P>Brother Nee said that one who is an apostle must be able to decide the meaning of doctrines to determine whether a certain truth is according to the holy Scriptures. Both to decide the meaning of doctrines and to appoint elders are not simple matters. They require a person to be adequately equipped and not to be too young in physical age. Suppose a young person who is twenty-six years old appoints a person who is fifty-eight years old to be an elder; this is entirely inappropriate. Therefore, do not think that without you no one can appoint elders. It is better not to appoint any elder than to have a young person doing the appointing. This is a problem which we need to avoid among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Pride</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Pride Is an Attribute of Our Fallen Nature by Birth</H2><P>To fulfill the obligations of the co-workers and elders, first, we need to beware of ambition, and second, we need to beware of pride. Pride is an attribute of our fallen nature by birth. God has His attributes and we have ours. We are fallen human beings, and as such, the first attribute we have is pride. Who is not proud? Whoever is not proud is good for nothing. In the Lord's work, however, we must try our best to guard against pride.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Be a Co-worker and an Elder and How to Fulfill Their Obligations &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
