<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ONENESS VERSUS DIVISION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Oneness:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The genuine oneness among the believers of Christ is of the Triune God; the real oneness originates from the Triune God; the three of the Divine Trinity are really one among Themselves.</li>	<li>At the last hour of His course on the earth, after He gave the word on the mysterious Divine Trinity dispensing and transfusing Himself into the believers in John 14&#151;16 right before His betrayal, the Lord prayed to the Father for the oneness among all His believers that it may merge with the genuine oneness of the Divine Trinity.</li>	<li>On another occasion the Lord charged us to be in harmony when two of us would pray together for anything.</li>	<li>The one hundred twenty were praying for ten days with one accord, and their prayer was answered in a marvelous way on the day of Pentecost.</li>	<li>At other times the apostles with the disciples praised God with one accord and God's response to them was marvelous, and the heart and soul of the multitude of believers were one.</li>	<li>The apostle charges us to keep the oneness of the Spirit and gives us a clear picture of how the oneness of the Body of Christ is constituted with the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence of this inner constitution&#151;and of how the Body is the outward vessel to contain the reality of this constituted oneness between the processed Triune God and the transformed believers.</li>	<li>At other times the apostle also charges us to stand in one spirit and strive with one soul for the gospel, thinking the same one thing, having the same love, joined in one soul.</li>	<li>In conclusion, both the Lord's presence and God's blessing to the believers in the churches are based upon their oneness in the Spirit, their one accord among themselves, and their harmony in prayer, work, and love. Psalm 133 shows us that God's people dwelling in unity is the base of God's anointing and of God's refreshing grace that they may participate in the God-commanded blessing of life forevermore.</li>	</ol><li>Versus division:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Divisions (sects) are of the flesh.</li>	<li>Divisions are not only of the flesh but also according to the manner of man&#151;1 Cor. 3:3.</li>	<li>Divisions damage Christ as the unique One and His Body&#151;1 Cor. 1:10-13.</li>	<li>The Corinthian believers were divided while they were still meeting together to take the Lord's supper not for the better but for the worse; thus, the apostle would not consider that they came together to eat the Lord's supper&#151;1 Cor. 11:17-20.</li>	<li>No reason and no excuse to be given to any kind of division and no justification for it.</li>	<li>The apostle charged us to turn away from those who make divisions and to refuse a sectarian man&#151;Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10.</li>	</ol></ol>
