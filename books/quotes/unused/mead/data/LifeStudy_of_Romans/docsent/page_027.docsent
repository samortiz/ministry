   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BELIEVING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The called race becomes the believing race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham was first a called one, then a believing one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He had abandoned everything and had no way to go on except to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He trusted in God because he did not know where he was going.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God had only told him to leave his country, his kindred, and his father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did not tell Abraham where he was going, forcing him to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham could say, I simply trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I go wherever He leads me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we study the history of Abraham, we will learn that his life was a trusting life, a believing life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God did not expect Abraham to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God seemed to tell him, Abraham, you have been called by Me. Don t do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I ll do everything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just stay with Me. When I move, you move.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must go wherever I go.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Don t do anything for yourself or by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what it means to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people have the mistaken impression that believing in the Lord Jesus is simply saying, Lord Jesus, I believe in You.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I take You as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is right, but the implications are far-reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It means that we must terminate ourselves, admitting that we are nothing, have nothing, and can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every step and every moment we must trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not know how to do things; I only know how to trust in my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have been called out of everything that is not God and now I believe into everything that is God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe in Him and I believe in all that He has accomplished for me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe in what He can do for me and in what He shall do for me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I put my full trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the testimony of the called and believing race.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As children of Abraham, the believing father, we are a believing people Gal 3:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A. God Who Calls Things Not Being as Being</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In what kind of God did Abraham believe?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who is the God in whom we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The God in whom Abraham believed was the God who calls things not being as being 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The God of Abraham calls things not existing as existing, meaning that He creates things out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abraham believed in such a God and applied this God to his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense, Abraham was unable to produce an heir.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, God called Isaac into being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although Isaac had no being, God called him into being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Isaac did not exist and when there was no possibility for him to exist, God declared, There shall be an Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isaac was born: God had called something not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must believe in the same God, for He is the almighty Creator who calls things not existing as existing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. God Who Gives Life to the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The God in whom Abraham believed was the God who gives life to the dead 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that God can resurrect the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Abraham experienced this when God asked him to offer up Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As Abraham offered Isaac, he believed that God would raise him from the dead Heb 11:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He believed that God would give life to his son and that he would have his son again in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to believe in the Lord Jesus in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We believe in God the Creator, who calls things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also believe in Him as the life-giver, as the One who can raise the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He can create out of nothing and He can give life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may apply this to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may feel that the situation in your local church is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yes, it is very poor; in fact, it is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You must say to the Lord, Lord, come in to call things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps you may migrate to a certain locality and find that it is a place filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That is the reason God sent you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must believe in Him as the One who gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 1949 I was sent to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I thought of that island as a backward region.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I had been living and working in Shanghai, the largest city in the Far East, where the Lord s work was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A thousand saints were meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We had seventeen homes for meetings and four publications.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suddenly I was removed from mainland China and sent to the little island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I surveyed the situation, I was deeply disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I could not do anything and I did not want to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I had no appetite to work in such a backward country with its poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I laid on the bed and looked at the ceiling, saying to myself, What are you doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why did you come here?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then I turned to my wife and asked, Why did we come?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What can we do?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I was very troubled, and my wife had no word to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One day, the God who calls things not being as being and who gives life to the dead touched my heart, telling me not to be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After that, I was burdened for the work on Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In less than five years we grew in numbers from three hundred and fifty people to twenty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>During the first year we increased almost thirty-fold.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many who were saved during that time are now co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must believe in the God who calls things not being as being and who gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not be disappointed by the situation in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not say that everything is poor and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Such a place is the right place for you and the right place for God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Is it poor?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You have a rich God who calls things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Is it dead?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You have a living God who gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Your situation gives an opportunity for God to come in and impart life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not complain.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Call on Him and believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Do not be disappointed with your family situation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Do not say that your wife is poor or that your husband is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The more you say that your wife is poor, the worse she is.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The more you say that your husband is dead, the worse he is.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You must declare, My wife is poor, but my God is not poor.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>My husband is dead, but my God is not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The God in whom I believe is the God who creates things out of nothing and who gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>My God does not give life to the living He gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>My situation is an excellent opportunity for God.</S>
