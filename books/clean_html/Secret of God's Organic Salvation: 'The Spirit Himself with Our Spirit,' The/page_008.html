<p>Prayer: Lord, we extol You as the speaking God. You spoke in ancient times, and we have Your Word in our hand. Lord, You are still speaking as the Spirit. Your Spirit is the speaking Spirit, and we listen to His speaking. Lord, You are speaking through Your Son, and we are a part of Your sonship. We believe You are still speaking through us. Thank You, Lord, for Your speaking. In the past seventy-four years in Your recovery Your speaking has not ceased. Every year You have given us new light and new revelation by Your speaking. How we thank You! In the last few years Your speaking among us has been very much enriched. Lord, we ask You once again to release what You have shown us. Lord, bless it and use it. We know that Your intention is to build up the Body of Your Son, which is the organism of the Triune God. Lord, we can do nothing. We trust in You. Amen.</p><p>In the previous chapter we pointed out that the word <i>secret</i> denotes the skillful way of doing things. The secret of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the Spirit with our spirit. This Spirit is the generating Spirit, the nourishing Spirit, the sanctifying Spirit, the renewing Spirit, the transforming Spirit, the building Spirit, the maturing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, and the intensified Spirit. Have you ever realized that the Spirit has these nine aspects? Our spirit needs to be touched by Christ in nine ways and become a spirit quickened by Christ, cherished by Christ, captivated by Christ, indwelt by Christ, filled by Christ, possessed by Christ, enriched with Christ, exulting with Christ, and drawn by the Lamb. Is your spirit in these nine states? Your spirit has been quickened by Christ, but has it been cherished by Christ and captivated by Christ? If your spirit has been captivated by Christ, then you must be like the one in the Song of Songs, one who has been captivated by Christ, the captivating One. Your spirit is surely indwelt by Christ, and now the renewing Spirit is doing a renewing work within you. In order to renew us, Christ as the Spirit must dwell in our spirit. Your spirit should also be filled by Christ so that you can be transformed and then built up with others. If you would be built up with others in the Body of Christ, your spirit needs to be possessed by Christ. Building is impossible if we are not possessed by Christ in our spirit. You also need to be enriched by Christ in your spirit. If your spirit is enriched with Christ, you will be able to mature. Furthermore, your spirit needs to be in a state of exulting with Christ. This exulting is related to your being saturated with the glory of God and being brought into the glory of God for your glorification. Surely we all will exult at the time of Christ&rsquo;s coming and of our rapture and the transfiguration of our body to be &ldquo;conformed to the body of His glory&rdquo; (Phil. 3:21). Finally, your spirit should be drawn by the Lamb. The overcomers in Revelation 14 are drawn by the Christ as the Lamb and follow Him wherever He may go (v. 4).</p><p>In this message we will cover two sections of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;the section of feeding and the section of sanctification. These sections are closely related, for without feeding there can be no sanctification. Sanctification is by feeding. The more we feed on the word of God, the more we are sanctified. The word on which we feed sanctifies us. In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; The word contains the element with which God sanctifies us. For this reason, feeding and sanctification are closely related.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE SECRET OF FEEDING</h2><p>Feeding is the second section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. In God&rsquo;s organic salvation feeding is the continuation of regeneration. As all mothers know, after a baby has been delivered the baby needs feeding. Mothers also know that the best way to comfort and satisfy a baby is to nurse him, feeding him with milk. Feeding is, therefore, the continuation of birth, of regeneration.</p><p>Regeneration brings us into a divine existence and makes us divine persons. As the continuation of regeneration, feeding enables us to maintain and develop our divine existence. Feeding is an ongoing process that will continue through all the following sections of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification. Feeding, therefore, will continue all the way from regeneration to glorification. If we see this, we will not look down on the matter of feeding. It is by feeding that we receive the element with which God sanctifies us, and it is by feeding that we receive the riches with which God renews us, transforms us, builds us up, conforms us, and glorifies us.</p>
