<P>Verses 25-34: The main subject is on not being anxious concerning food, drink, or clothing. The serving of mammon probably starts with the anxiety for food, drink, or clothing. "Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?" This shows that believers should have noble thoughts. "Can God...?" This is man's unbelief. Anyone who asks "Can God...?" expresses his unbelief. If we have no faith in God, it will be very difficult for us to live our daily life. All anxieties can be taken away only by believing in God. When the Lord wants us to consider, He often uses questions. God created the heavens and the earth in the first five days, and then on the sixth day He created man. God had first prepared everything that man needed, yet man still thinks as though he was created on the first day.</P><P>Verse 27: "Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?" This is the third question that the Lord raised. In other words, since anxiety is useless, then why be anxious? If there is a remedy, there is no need to be anxious. If there is no remedy, it is useless to be anxious.</P><P>Verses 26 and 27 cover the matter of food and drink. We easily see the birds if we lift up our eyes. Therefore, the Lord said, "Look...." Verses 28-30 speak about the matter of clothing. Lilies are not common. Therefore, the Lord said, "Consider well...." Oh, how careful the Lord was! The lilies mentioned here are probably colorful. From the phrase "you of little faith" we can see that this was spoken to the saved ones. Mr. George Müller's whole life of trusting God was based on these two great promises concerning the birds and the lilies. His exercise of faith is a characteristic needed for this age.</P><P>Verse 31: "Therefore do not be anxious." "Therefore" is used here once more. This is a summary. The reason the Lord used the illustrations of the birds and of the lilies is to forbid us from being anxious and not to forbid us from working. When the Lord said to behold the birds and to consider the lilies, He was not asking us to imitate them. The Lord said through Paul, "If anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat" (2 Thes. 3:10). To "sow" and to "reap" (v. 26) is the work of men, whereas to "toil" and "spin thread" (v. 28) is the work of women.</P><P>Verse 32: "For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things." "Your heavenly Father knows" indicates that this is spoken to believers. God provides us only what we need. God will not provide us what we demand or what we ourselves would like to have.</P><P>Verse 33: "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." What is the kingdom? On one hand, the kingdom refers to a spiritual condition. For example, the Bible says, "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 14:17). On the other hand, the kingdom refers to the ruling in the millennium (Luke 19:11). One is the present spiritual living, and the other is the future reward. The present spiritual condition of the believers enables them to reign in the future. The emphasis of the " kingdom" here is the future.</P><P>The "righteousness" here can only be obtained by seeking. Thus we see that this is neither the justification by faith nor the righteousness of God mentioned in Romans 3. Rather, this is the righteousness in Matthew 5—7, the righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, the righteousness mentioned in 6:1. Righteousness specifically refers to the conduct described in Matthew 5—7.</P><P>The phrase "seek...His kingdom" emphasizes not only the present spiritual condition but even more the future reward. "Added" means that you already have something, and other things are added to what you already have. Since you seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, you obtain the kingdom of God and His righteousness; in addition, you have food, drink, and clothing. To one who has nothing, something is "given"; to one who already has something, more things are "added."</P><P>Verse 34: "Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient for the day is its own evil." This shows that the Lord did not ordain believers to have a life of ease and comfort.</P>
