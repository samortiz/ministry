   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT A SUFFERING, BUT A JOY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With respect to the losing of the soul, the Lord did not speak about suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think that if you lose the soul, you will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you have had some experience with this matter, you will know that apparently the losing of the soul is a suffering, but actually it is a real joy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a sister loses her soul by forgiving her husband, that will be a joy to her and to her family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It will issue in the building up of the proper family life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same is true in principle with the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To lose our soulish enjoyment is a joy because as a result we see the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are willing to lose your soul in a practical way, others will be nourished by you and built up through you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not a suffering; it is a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hebrews 12:2 says that the Lord endured the cross because of the joy that was set before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord did not go to the cross with tears; rather, He went joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His going to the cross was His losing of His soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But because He foresaw the result, He did not feel sorry for Himself about losing His soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that through His death many grains would be brought forth John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The need today is that we all learn how to lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the church life do not insist on preserving any soulish enjoyment for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not mean, however, that those in the brothers houses are expected to work like slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The parents of some of the brothers may misunderstand this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have the grace, you will realize that the losing of the soul is not a form of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As you are washing dishes in the brothers house, you will be happy and willing to lose your soulish enjoyment to satisfy others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CHURCH TRANSFIGURED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THROUGH THE LOSING OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The losing of the soul is the basic factor in our being built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not only a matter of denying the self or of bearing the cross, but of losing the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to lose all our present soulish enjoyment for the Lord s sake, for the sake of the church, and for the sake of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are willing to lose your soul for the sake of others, those with you will be enlightened, nourished, and filled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the way the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If all the saints are willing to lose the soul, what a wonderful situation there will be among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There will be no offenses and even no need for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are like this, we shall be rewarded with a prevailing transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if we are not willing to lose our soul, we shall not share in this transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, for us the church life will be darkness, and, during the time of transfiguration, we shall be rewarded with suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead of being joyful, we shall be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a negative reward for being unwilling to lose the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our willingness to lose the soul for the Lord s sake will cause the church to be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, it will bring in a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every genuine revival is a coming of Christ, a present coming of Christ with His reward not His second coming in a physical way .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He rewards the faithful ones positively and the unfaithful ones negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have seen this happen in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a revival, a transfiguration, came, some were enjoying and others were gnashing their teeth in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>NO FEELING OF DISSENSION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How I thank the Lord for showing us these three keys, the keys of self-denial, bearing the cross, and losing the soul!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we deny ourselves, we shall not have any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was working with Brother Nee in China, I realized that he had been appointed by the Lord to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, I did whatever he said.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, this did not mean that I did not sometimes have a better way to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to my knowledge, my way would sometimes have saved a great deal of time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, I did not say a word, simply because I did not want Brother Nee to feel that I was dissenting with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of taking the time necessary to make my way clear, I denied myself, forgot my way, and followed Brother Nee s way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, this not only saved time; it also saved us from the feeling of dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all are human.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we say contrary things to one another, it is difficult to avoid the feeling of dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This feeling is subtle, and it may give rise to friction between us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>LEARNING TO BE FLEXIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1934 Brother Nee conducted a conference in Hang-chow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At this conference, I met a certain co-worker whom Brother Nee knew very well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Regarding him, Brother Nee said, This brother is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever you tell him to go west, he will go east.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, Brother Nee did not criticize this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At first, I did not understand Brother Nee s language, although his word impressed me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, I learned that this brother was exactly like Brother Nee had said.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In those days we were all learning to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we had insisted that this brother go in a certain direction, it would have meant that we were not denying ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We had to deny ourselves to fit into his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We knew that if we told him to go west, he would go east.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, if we wanted him to go west, we would suggest that he go east.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then he would go west.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because similar situations exist among us today, all the elders need to learn to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They also need to become familiar with the various dispositions of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The way to learn this is by denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although a brother may always act contrary to what we say, he is still a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is the will of God for us, and we must deny the self and take him up as a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As we endeavor to do this, we also need to lose our soulish enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>LOSING THE SOUL IN THE FAMILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>AND IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Husbands and wives argue with each other because they find it enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The reason a husband is not willing to lose the case to his wife is that it would mean the losing of his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if a brother loses his soul by losing the case to his wife, the Lord will reward him by coming in at a certain point to save his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>That will be the time for the soul to have its enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This illustrates the fact that the family life is built up through the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There cannot be a proper family life without the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For the sake of the family, you need to lose your enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then the Lord Jesus will reward you in a positive way when He causes a transfiguration to take place in your family.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The same is true in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the church, we all need to learn to lose our soul, to lose our soulish enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>By losing our souls, a transfiguration will take place.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then in the Lord s transfiguration we shall be rewarded positively, and the Lord will save our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you consider your experience, you will find that this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Without the third key, the losing of the soul, the first two keys do not work very well.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need the last key, the losing of the soul, in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In every aspect of the church life we need to lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we lose our soulish enjoyment, we shall not argue with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Therefore, the losing of the soul is the way for the church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>By the exercise of the three keys, the gates of Hades are locked up and the doors of heaven are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When Hades is locked up and the heavens are opened, we shall have an excellent church life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This excellent church life is the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the way for the church to be built up.</S>
