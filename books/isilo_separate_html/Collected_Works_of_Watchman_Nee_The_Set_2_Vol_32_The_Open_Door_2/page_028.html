Sister Shuai-shin will be with me. I will only be there for ten days. Please pray for the conference in Ch'ang-sha.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, July 22</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>Brother Ma Chuan-foo came yesterday and told me that you are concerned about our recent condition. Let me relate it to you in the following way. There were over fifty brothers and sisters from Fu-Yang. After we arrived in Lan-Si, we had to take refuge at a relief center. There was no liberty to move around in the relief shelter, and it was not convenient to preach the Lord Jesus in public. During the month that I stayed in the relief center, I always prayed that the Lord would give us the chance to preach the gospel to individuals and to the refugee children at least. Thank the Lord. He allowed me to preach the gospel to the presiding Buddhist monk and some of the refugees. I was able to teach for two weeks at the refugee school and tell them Old Testament stories and the salvation of the cross, including one short hymn.</p><p>But there were still inconveniences at the relief center. On June 22 I took my family of six and left Lan-Si. The old and weak were not used to traveling and became sick. We rested a few times on the way. On July 2 we arrived at Yi-Yang. Now we are living in Brother Chang Gung-jih's house. Praise the Lord, all six members of my family have been healed. The Lord's grace is sufficient for us.</p><p>We ask for your prayer concerning two things: (1) Prolonged traveling has tired me out. I find that I cannot sustain myself in writing and reading, and my eyesight is failing. I wonder how I can continue to serve the Lord this way. (2) Pray that the brothers and sisters taking refuge in Lan-Si would soon find a safe place where they can support themselves and worship God. The prayer meeting, gospel meeting, and Bible study meetings have begun here. There are more brothers and sisters. Some of them will go to Ch'ang-sha for the conference (Brother Tang will be conducting the conference). Please do not forget to pray. Greetings in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, July 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Sister Ma Tsi-ying and Sister Tang from Hankow are presently staying in my place (July 13). Brother Lee Shi-chun, Brothers Chung and Ping, Sister Yuen Jing-hwa, Mrs. Wang (Aunt of Sun Wen-sian) and the children, and Miss Kuo have arrived in Chungking. The brothers are living in the inns, while the sisters are living in the rented house of the local church in Lo-Tsia-Wan. Sister Ma Min-jen is sicker; she is staying in Yi-Chang but will come to Chungking soon (July 19). Seven members of the Mei family arrived this morning at eleven o'clock. After lunch at my place, they moved to Lo-Tsia-Wan. My husband's company will move here in two weeks (July 20).</p><p>Sister Jie (wife of Yuen How-tsai,<br />Chungking, Szechuen)</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>Swatow has been bombed quite frequently of late. Most of the brothers and sisters have scattered to inland regions to escape the war. The Lord's Day before last, we still had our meeting, but the number was very small. There were only ten persons in the bread-breaking meeting. Yesterday was the Lord's Day, and we had to abandon the meetings. Presently, the brothers and sisters scattered in the inland regions are trying to help each other. Temporarily, they are still able to get by. If the condition continues, some brothers and sisters may be in difficulty soon. A few families have moved to Jing-Gang Village near Jieh-Yang. Brother Chia Tze-shun is also there. The rest of the brothers and sisters returned to their hometowns or are staying with relatives. Brother Chai Gi-chen has moved back to his village, and we do not have his address. This is the general condition of Swatow. We do not know what will happen in the future. May the Lord be merciful to us and care for us. Please remember the brothers and sisters remaining in Swatow and those who have been scattered.</p><p>Brother Chen Fang-ching, July 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
