The knowledge concerning Christ and the apprehension concerning Christ were released to a surpassing degree in the writings of Paul. The apostle Paul used the dimensions of the universe&#151;the breadth, length, height, and depth&#151;in order to show the dimensions of Christ (Eph. 3:18). The breadth, length, height, and depth are all Christ. No one except Christ knows how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, or how deep is the depth of the universe. Christ Himself is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the entire universe. He is all-inclusive and all-extensive. Such a Christ first came down from the heavens to the earth; then He descended into Hades, the lower parts of the earth. After that, He ascended to the earth, and then He ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things (4:8-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Spirit</H2><P>The third great revelation in the New Testament is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God to us. Not only so; He is the consummation of the processed Triune God. The Triune God, after being processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, has become the Spirit. Eventually, the Bible ends with the divine title the Spirit. Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!" The Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God and the bride as the consummation of the chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified mankind become a universal couple. This couple is the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The revelation concerning the Spirit was shown mainly to the apostle Paul. John in his Gospel had some revelation concerning the Spirit, but his writing is only a record of what he saw; it is not his teaching. However, Paul's writing in his Epistles is his teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Transformation of the Believers</H2><P>The fourth great revelation in the New Testament is the transformation of the believers. Regeneration, subjective sanctification, renewing, conformation, and glorification are also included in this revelation. As a young man I searched for a proper definition of regeneration, until one day when I read a sentence in one of T. Austin-Sparks's books saying that regeneration is to receive another life in addition to our natural life. When I read this sentence, I was very excited. This is a wonderful definition of regeneration. In addition to understanding regeneration, we also need to understand what sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification are. The Bible says that in glorification we will be exactly the same as Christ in every respect (1 John 3:2). This is a great revelation concerning the transformation of the believers.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_147.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_149.html">Next</a> </body></html>
