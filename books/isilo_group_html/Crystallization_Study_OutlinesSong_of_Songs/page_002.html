<h1 class="title">Fellowshipping in the Inner Chambers of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:4b-8</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The inner chambers of Christ&mdash;1:4b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>His lovers&rsquo; regenerated spirits mingled with and indwelt by Him as the life-dispensing Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:11.</li>
	<li>The practical Holy of Holies in Christ&rsquo;s lovers for their participation in and enjoyment of the pneumatic Christ as the consummated Triune God&mdash;Heb. 4:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The fellowship in the mingled spirit of Christ&rsquo;s lovers&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; Rom. 8:4b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the joy of Christ&rsquo;s lover with her companions, extolling His unrivaled love&mdash;S.S. 1:4c.</li>
	<li>Enlightened to see how she is, sinful in Adam but justified in Christ&mdash;vv. 5-6a.</li>
	<li>Receiving the revelation on how to enter the church life&mdash;vv. 7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Realizing that she was separated from Christ&rsquo;s flock by the denominational people and that she needs Christ&rsquo;s feeding and rest with satisfaction&mdash;vv. 6b-7; John 10:16; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2.</li>
		<li>Instructed by Christ that she should leave where she was kept away from the church and go forth on the footsteps of the flock&mdash;S.S. 1:8a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The flock is the church in the proper sense according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching in the New Testament.</li>
			<li>The footsteps of the flock have laid a line showing us the proper way to follow the Lord in His recovery.</li>
			<li>The church is the place where Christ pastures, shepherds and feeds, His saints.</li>
			<li>Christ charges her to pasture, shepherd and feed, her spiritual children in the churches (shepherds&rsquo; tents)&mdash;v. 8b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Though the lover of Christ is seeking after Christ for her own satisfaction and rest, Christ, in answering her request and instructing her how to seek after Him, charges her to take care of her spiritual children, the members of the Body of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
