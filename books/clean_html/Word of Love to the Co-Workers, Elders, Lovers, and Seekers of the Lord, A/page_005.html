<h2 class="head2">The Danger in Disciplining Young Ones</h2><p>All parents know that every child is naughty. Some babies throw their rice bowl when their mother is feeding them. What should the mother do? The mother mostly cherishes them to make them happy, and by cherishing them, she feeds them. Parents raise their children by cherishing them in many ways. I have eight children; I have suffered much, and I have learned all the lessons. Ephesians 6:4 says, &ldquo;Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.&rdquo; When we discipline our children with provoking, our discipline is of no value. If we are going to discipline a child, we must go to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, take away my provocation.&rdquo; This is very hard. Some parents whom I have taught in this way have said that without being provoked they cannot discipline their child. To them, punishing a child requires that they be provoked. Parents must remember not to spank their child when they are provoked. If one is offended by his child, he becomes a provocation to him, and he loses his capacity to discipline the child. When one is angry, he should not touch his children. He should leave them, kneel down, and pray. Then, when he is cherished by the Lord, he can go back to his children to cherish them. We need cherishing. When a parent provokes his child and spanks him, the child may leave home and run away. Then the parent needs to spend time to find him and bring him back. Many children after being provoked to anger and spanked leave home and do not want to come back. Eventually, the parent has to submit to them, bowing down his head to beg them to come back home, and he may have to gain them back indirectly through a big brother, a cousin, or some other relative.</p><p>Luke 15 first tells us how the Lord as the Shepherd sought for the one lost sheep. Second, the woman, signifying the Holy Spirit, lit a lamp and searched the house to find the lost coin. Third, a father lost his son, the prodigal, who eventually returned. The son prepared an apology for his father, but the father was already waiting to receive him. The son did not first see the father; the father first saw him and ran to him. The Brethren teacher from England under whom I first learned this chapter taught us that in the entire Bible only Luke 15 says that God ran. God only ran once, and it was to receive a returning prodigal son. In Brother Nee&rsquo;s preaching concerning the loving father who watched for his son&rsquo;s return, he once told a story of a naughty boy who ran away after being punished by his father. The father sat in his living room every night for many days expecting to receive his son back. One night the naughty boy came back home and was surprised to see his father still sitting there. The father said, &ldquo;Son, since you left I have been sitting here every night waiting and expecting to receive you back.&rdquo; This is a father&rsquo;s heart. Our brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes should be like this, full of love and full of expectation.</p><h2 class="head2">Gaining People through a Proper Spirit</h2><p>One day Hall Three in the church in Taipei had a time with all the parents of the ones who lived in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes. The brothers showed all the parents their children&rsquo;s living room, dining room, dormitory, and beds. Many parents were inspired by this. They went out to tell other parents to send their children to certain schools close to those homes. Some of the unsaved parents were even saved because of that demonstration. We should have this kind of spirit. If we have this kind of spirit, the number of houses that we now have will not be sufficient. The more houses we have, the better it will be. This is one of the ways for us to bear fruit. The brothers in Taipei have the assurance that they can gain people in this way.</p><p>When school opens, the brothers and sisters also go to the campus to set up a table and get the names of the freshmen. Then the brothers and sisters work on those persons. In a similar way, the Mormons in the United States teach their young people to speak good Mandarin and send them to the airport in proper attire. They stand at the entry and watch the new young people come in. They greet them in Mandarin and ask if they are students coming to attend school. Then they take their address and offer them a ride. This is the way they gain people.</p>
