   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD IN EXODUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Exodus there is a great deal of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, the Passover was an enjoyment for the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was a feast that eventually was made an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every year the first of the feasts was the feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The focus of this feast is the lamb, which typifies Christ as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that Christ is the initial enjoyment of God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even while the children of Israel were still in Egypt, they could have a good enjoyment of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only did they apply the blood to the lintel of the door, but they ate the flesh of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, that lamb was for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the children of Israel came into the wilderness, they began to enjoy the manna and the living water out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The children of Israel, therefore, enjoyed at least three things the Passover, the manna, and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is important for us to realize that they had all this enjoyment before the tabernacle and the priesthood were revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that even without the tabernacle and the priesthood, they could have the enjoyment of the lamb, the manna, and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are clear concerning the situation of the children of Israel, we shall be able to see where today s Christians stand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Where are most Christians: before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, or after?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No doubt, the majority of Christians are before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the situation of today s Christians is one without God s dwelling and without God s priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At best, most Christians enjoy the Passover lamb, the manna, and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the number of those who enjoy the living water is actually very few.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I was young, I heard much talk about the Passover lamb and also about the manna, but I did not hear nearly as much concerning the living water out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to ask ourselves where we are with respect to the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do we have only the enjoyment that comes before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, that is, the enjoyment of the Lamb, the manna, and the water?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where are you concerning the enjoyment of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are you before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, or after?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This question is extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If in your enjoyment of Christ you are before the tabernacle and the priesthood, then you cannot have any share in the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This ointment can be enjoyed only after God s dwelling place and the body of serving ones have come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not for God s chosen people to enjoy apart from God s dwelling and His priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When asked whether your enjoyment of Christ is before or after the tabernacle and the priesthood, you may find it difficult to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may hesitate, not knowing whether to say yes or no. However, I have the assurance that the vast majority of us have had at least some experience of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What we have enjoyed in our experience is not only the oil but the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whereas the oil is simple, containing just one element, the ointment is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have pointed out again and again, it is a compound produced by blending four spices with olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is extremely significant that in Exodus 30 we have a record of the divine revelation concerning this compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elements and the quantity of these spices are also significant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although there are four kinds of spices, there are actually only three complete units of five-hundred shekels each.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE NUMBERS THREE AND FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the record concerning the compound ointment, we have the numbers three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Bible, when the numbers three and five are put together, this combination is related to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s first building was the ark of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the description of the ark there are multiples of the numbers three and five: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits Gen 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, the ark was to be made with lower, second, and third stories Gen 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God s second building was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The tabernacle was of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With the tabernacle, the number five occurs frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, the tabernacle was made with ten curtains of fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to Exodus 26:3, five curtains were joined to one another, and the other five curtains were also to be joined to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the curtains in the outer court were squares each measuring five cubits by five cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Also, the altar of burnt offering was five cubits in length and width, and three cubits in height.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, with God s second building we have the numbers three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Bible the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Resurrection, as we know, was on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the Triune God and resurrection are both signified by the number three.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we have mentioned several times, in the Bible the number five, formed of four plus one, signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the numbers three and five together signify the Triune God in resurrection bearing responsibility for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is for the building.</S>
