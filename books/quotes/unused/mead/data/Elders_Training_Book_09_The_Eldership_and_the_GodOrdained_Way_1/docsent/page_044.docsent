   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE GOSPELS AND THE ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Lord's ministry as depicted in the four Gospels, we cannot see anything organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord did not organize anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He appointed the twelve apostles, but before He died, He did not make any arrangement for His successors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not tell the disciples that after He died, Peter would be first and John would be second.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, He did not tell them that Peter would be the president and John would be the vice-president.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was not such an organizational arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After He was resurrected, He did not come back to the disciples to make any organizational arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, He said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age" Matt 28:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was His "will" to His disciples before His departure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He told the disciples to go and disciple the nations by baptizing them into the Triune God and by teaching them what He had taught the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus' teaching in the four Gospels became the first part of the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then Acts records that Peter taught the new believers based upon the Lord Jesus' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That became the second part of the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then following Peter, Paul taught, and his teaching became the third part of the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John taught in his Gospel, in his Epistles, and in Revelation, and some others wrote some Epistles in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of these writings became the last part of the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these parts of the apostles' teaching are the contents of the New Testament, which is concerning God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Lord Jesus' teaching in the Gospels, there was no organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, in the book of Acts, we see one hundred twenty Galileans organically meeting together 1:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were living by the Spirit who had been breathed into them on the day of resurrection John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where were those whom the Lord Jesus had saved in Jerusalem and in Judea?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of the one hundred twenty came from Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They came together organically, without any organizational arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Lord Jesus had organized something, the disciples might have insisted that Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others from Jerusalem and Judea join them, but there was no organizing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They met together in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They lived by the Spirit as the breath which had been breathed into them on the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the book of Acts, Peter and Paul did not organize anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The appointment of the seven deacons in Acts 6 was not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was organic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostles said that they should not leave the ministry of the word to serve tables.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They told the disciples, "Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word" 6:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These seven men were full of the Spirit and of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not refer to anything of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This refers to life and to the Spirit, indicating that this appointment was altogether organic.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was an organic arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may feel that any kind of arrangement must be a kind of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then I would say that this was an "organic organization."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The service of these deacons was organized according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Their appointment was organic.</S>
