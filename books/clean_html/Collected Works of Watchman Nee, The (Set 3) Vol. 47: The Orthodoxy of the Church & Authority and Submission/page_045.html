<h2 class="head2">Authority Being God's Selection<br />Rather than Man's Attainment</h2><p>God called all three to come out to the entrance of the tent of meeting (v. 4). Aaron and Miriam came out boldly, presuming that they would be vindicated. They thought that God had finally called them. They thought, "You, Moses, have married an Ethiopian woman and have caused unhappiness in the family. We have many things to say to God." But God said, "Moses is My servant. He is faithful in all My house. Why are you so bold as to speak against My servant?" Spiritual authority does not come through man's attainment. Rather, it comes through God's selection. Spiritual matters are entirely different from worldly principles.</p><p>Authority is God Himself. It cannot be offended. Whoever speaks against Moses speaks against God's selection. We cannot despise God's selection.</p><h2 class="head2">The Manifestation of Rebellion Being Leprosy</h2><p>When the anger of God was kindled, the cloud removed from over the tent, and the presence of God was gone. Immediately, Miriam became leprous (v. 10). This was not from infection. It was inflicted by God. Being leprous is not any better than marrying an Ethiopian woman. As soon as inward rebellion is manifested, it becomes leprosy. Lepers have to be shut out. Man cannot approach them. They lose all fellowship.</p><p>When Aaron saw that Miriam became leprous, he besought Moses to be a mediator so that God would heal her. God instructed Miriam to be shut out from the camp seven days before she could be received again. She bore shame for seven days as if her father had spit in her face. Only after seven days did the tent of meeting journey on. Whenever there is rebellion and reviling among us, God's presence is gone, and the tent will not move. The pillar of cloud will not come until reviling words have been judged. If the matter of authority is not settled, all other matters will remain unsettled.</p><h2 class="head2">Submitting to God's Direct Authority<br />and Also Submitting to His Deputy Authority</h2><p>Many think that they have submitted themselves to God already. They do not know that they still need to submit to God's deputy authority. Those who are truly submissive see God's authority in all environments&mdash;in their homes and in all institutions. God said, "Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?" (v. 8). Every time reviling words come, we have to pay much attention to them. We cannot be careless, thinking that we can say things rashly. When there is reviling, it proves that there is the spirit of rebellion within. The reviling is the sprouting of this rebellion. We have to fear God and must not speak in a rash way. Many today speak against those ahead of them. They speak against the responsible brothers in the church, but they do not realize the seriousness of this matter. If one day the church receives grace from God, she will separate herself from those who revile the servant of God. She will not talk to them because they are leprous. May God be merciful to us that we would see that this is not a matter with our brother, but a matter of God's appointed authority. If we have met authority, we will realize that there are too many incidents where we sin against God. Thereafter, our concept concerning sin will be changed. We will see sin from God's point of view. The sin that God condemns is man's rebellion.</p>
