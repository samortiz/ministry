<p>In the foregoing message, we saw seven matters relating to Christ&rsquo;s divinity. We saw that Christ is God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If we have the Son we also have the Father. First John 2:23 says, &ldquo;Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.&rdquo; If the Son were not the Father, how could I have the Father by acknowledging the Son? Thus 1 John 2:23 proves that, in experience, the Son is the Father.</p>
<p>One day, as the Lord Jesus was speaking about the Father, Philip said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us&rdquo; (John 14:8). Philip seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Lord, we surely desire to see the Father. If You show us the Father, we&rsquo;ll be satisfied.&rdquo; Philip&rsquo;s question troubled the Lord Jesus, and He said to him, &ldquo;Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; (John 14:9). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Philip, what are you talking about? You ask Me to show you the Father. You have been seeing Me for more than three years. Don&rsquo;t you know that I am one with the Father? When you see Me, you see Him.&rdquo; When we see the Son, we see the Father. How foolish it is to be so doctrinal! Whenever we acknowledge the Son, we have the Father. This is our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE LORD AND RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to our experience we also know that whenever we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we receive the Spirit. Although we call on the name of Jesus, it is the Spirit who comes. We do not call on the Holy Spirit; we call on Jesus. Why does the Spirit come when we call on Jesus? It is because Jesus is the Spirit. Whenever I call a particular brother by name, that brother himself comes. This illustrates the fact that when we call the name, we get the person. Likewise, the more we call on the name of Jesus, the more the Spirit comes. Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person. When I call on the name of Jesus, the Person of the Spirit comes. This is not doctrine; it is our experience. Whenever I call on the name of the Lord Jesus for several minutes, I am filled and set on fire with the Spirit. How wonderful the Lord Jesus is! He is everything!</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS MAN</h2>
<p>Now we must see who Christ is according to His humanity. Christ is not only God, but also man. First Timothy 2:5 speaks of &ldquo;the man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; How can Christ be both God and man at the same time? The Bible reveals that He is God and man. Do you believe this? Can you comprehend it in full? Of course not. There is a vast difference between God and man! God is God, and man is man. Nevertheless, Christ is both God and man. Whenever you are asked to explain this, you should say, &ldquo;I cannot explain it in full, but I do know that the Bible says that Christ is both God and man.&rdquo; Christ is too wonderful to be explained. Nothing that we can explain is wonderful. Christ, who is both God and man, is unexplainable and wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF WOMAN</h2>
<p>In His humanity Christ is the seed of woman (Gen. 3:15). Galatians 4:4 says, &ldquo;But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman&rdquo; (Gk.). Although Christ is a man, He is still different from us. We were born of a human father, but Christ was not. He was born of woman. On the one hand, He had to have the human nature; on the other hand, He could not have the sinful nature. If He had been born of a human father, He would have had not only the human nature, but also the sinful nature. Therefore, Jesus was born of a woman that He might have a sinless human nature. Although He was a genuine man, He did not have our sinful nature. As the seed of the woman, He was born of the woman without having a sinful nature. Hallelujah for Christ&rsquo;s sinless human nature!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:16 indicates that Christ is the seed of Abraham. As the seed of Abraham, He inherits everything from God as a blessing to bestow upon His believers. In Him as the seed of Abraham we enjoy all the blessings God promised to Abraham.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF DAVID</h2>
<p>Christ is the seed of David, the son of David (Matt. 1:1). As the son of David, He inherits the kingship and the kingdom.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kernel of the Bible &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
