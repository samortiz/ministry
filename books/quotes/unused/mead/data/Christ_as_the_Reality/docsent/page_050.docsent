   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NORMAL CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us apply all these things in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians would like to be angels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And we all expect to be powerful, spiritual, and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps you have never had the desire to be an angel, but you did hope to be a spiritual person full of power and able to do many miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But among millions of real Christians today, where is such a man?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are always many exaggerated reports, but once you go there, there is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's economy today is not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His purpose is that we drink of this uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has no intention of making us angels, but of making us normal Christians with a normal humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, we do not mean that we must be naturally human, but "Jesusly" human.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not need any more of this poor, fallen humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our humanity is not suitable to be brought to God the Father as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our humanity is only good for the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must learn to take the humanity of Jesus to be a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If under God's sovereignty you are a young man, you must behave yourself as a proper young man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not mean according to the worldly standard, but according to the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If under God's sovereignty you are a wife, a husband, a father, or a mother, you must be a proper one, not according to our standard, but according to God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's intention is that we would have a proper family life, not by our humanity, but by the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should be different from all the other husbands or wives, whether they are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their standard is not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our standard is much higher and more practical than theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ours is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where is the humanity of Jesus today?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have already seen that the humanity of Jesus is in the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we will drink of the Spirit of Jesus, we will obtain the element of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a husband, the Lord's humanity will strengthen you to be a husband who is absolutely agreeable with God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It will not be according to any Christian standard or social standard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Neither Christianity nor society should be the standard of our human living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our Christian living must be up to the standard of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Young people have asked me if Christians should have any kind of exercise for their health.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do need some exercise, but to exercise in the same way as the world is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even in the matter of bodily exercise, we need the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some young people seeking to go on with the Lord have said that they could never exercise with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told them that they were one hundred percent right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not believe that any Christian who is one with the Lord can play in certain games and be on certain teams.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times I partake of bodily exercise, but it is not according to my own natural humanity, but the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not a matter of whether we exercise or not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is absolutely a matter of what kind of humanity we are exercising.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you exercise your own humanity, that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all must be one with Jesus in whatever we do by taking Him as our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we cannot take His humanity in any course of action, we had better not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not mean we should not be a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be the best human being, but not by our own humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need the humanity of Jesus, and this humanity is in the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
