   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Propagation of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The authority and power of the Spirit were to equip the disciples for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord had told them to "go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation" Mark 16:15 , and to be His witnesses unto the remotest part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ had gotten into some people in Jerusalem, but desired to get into thousands, even millions more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That would be His multiplication and spreading His propagation for the producing of the churches over the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Clothed with the economical Spirit, the disciples went out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On one day three thousand repented, and on another five thousand were saved!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit was their life inwardly and their authority outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why their work was so prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OUR EXPERIENCE OF</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BOTH ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even Christ as a man experienced the two aspects of the Spirit: He was born of the Holy Spirit essentially, and also baptized with the Spirit economically for His ministry and work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every believer in Christ should experience the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's desire is for a universal expression of Himself, a corporate man that is filled with His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To produce this expression, God has ordained that it be carried out by mortal men on the earth cooperating and coordinating with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What a monumental task!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet, we are more than able; Christ went through a tremendous process for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we can enjoy and experience the life-giving Spirit as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By now we should be clear of the many ways that we can partake of the Spirit for our essential living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in order to go out to preach Christ to others, we need the "heavenly uniform."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How do we experience this economical aspect of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We experience it by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The baptism of the Holy Spirit upon the Body in Acts was a once-for-all accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need to wait for it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have it already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 12:13 says that "in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we simply go out to preach confident of that fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we exercise our faith in this way we will find that hell, Satan, and the demons cannot prevail against our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will be clothed with the "uniform" of greatest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our preaching of Christ will prevail to bring Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we see a wonderful cycle for the propagation of the resurrected and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, we are filled and nourished with Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then, clothed with Him economically, we dispense Him to others that they may also enjoy Him as their life essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our essential enjoyment of the Lord is so that we may work economically to spread Him into others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But what we dispense to others must be what we are filled with essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One aspect is for the other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot do without either.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ will get His Body on the earth in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Each day we need to take Christ as the Spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then, knowing that we have the Spirit as our "uniform," we should carry out God's work of spreading and multiplying Himself into others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are well able to do it!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>QUESTIONS What does "essential" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What does "economical" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How did Christ, as the Spirit, produce the church with both the essential and economical aspects?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When did the disciples first experience both aspects of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can we experience both aspects of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Quoted Portions from Lee/LSM Publications The Kernel of the Bible, pp.</S>
