<h2 class="head1">THE LORD CASTING FIRE ON THE EARTH</h2><p>Verses 49 and 50 of Luke 12 are two of the most precious verses in the Bible. They are also among the hardest verses to understand. If we were to nominate four or five of the most puzzling passages in the New Testament, these two verses would be among them. In verse 49 the Lord said, "I have come to cast fire on the earth." The Lord told His listeners that He came to the earth with a specific purpose&mdash;to cast fire on the earth. What is this fire? This is not a fire that is produced by ordinary matches, but a fire that is apart from the earth. For example, I may throw my hymnbook on the chair. This means that the hymnbook was not on the chair but was thrown onto it from elsewhere. The Lord said that He came to cast fire on the earth. Where did this fire come from? It came from heaven. What is this fire? The book of Hebrews tells us that our God is a consuming fire (12:29). In many instances in the Bible, fire signifies God's life. His life is righteous and holy, and it is like a fire.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said that His purpose for coming to the earth was to cast God's life on it and to give God's life to man. At the time He spoke such a word, man did not have His life. This is why He said, "How I wish that it were already kindled!" (Luke 12:49). This means that He wished that man would receive His life that very day. Yet man did not receive it, because "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" (v. 50). The Lord told us that the fire was not kindled because He still had a baptism to be baptized with. This is puzzling. Was not Christ already baptized? Luke 3 clearly records that He was baptized. What does baptism in this verse mean? In reading Romans 6 and Colossians 2, we see that this baptism signifies death. For Christ to say that a baptism was still waiting to be accomplished meant that He had not yet died. Luke 12:50 does not say that He had not been baptized; rather, it says that there was a baptism which still needed to be accomplished. Why did such a baptism need to be accomplished? To accomplish something means that there is a goal. Suppose you want to do a certain work. After you have done the work, you have accomplished it. Christ's death was for the purpose of accomplishing one thing&mdash;God's purpose. Since He had not yet died, the fire was not yet kindled.</p><p>These two verses tell us that Christ came to cast God's life to the earth and to give man His life. Before Christ died, man had not received that life. After He died, man received this life. Without His death, this life could not have been released, and man could not have received it. Why did Christ have to die before man could have His life? The reason is provided in the following words: "How I am pressed." The word pressed in the original language means "squeezed, constrained." Christ said that He had a baptism to be baptized with, and He was pressed, or constrained, until it was accomplished. Why was He constrained? He was the divine life itself, and He was like the fire. This life filled the universe and was not bound or restricted by time and space. His life was omnipresent and omnipotent. It was everywhere and existed at all times. This life was like a fire. It kept on spreading; no one could lock it up, and no place was big enough to contain it.</p><p>Although Christ was equal with God, He became a man and confined this great life to the flesh. Such a tremendous life was contained in the flesh, which was limited by time and space. When He was in Caesarea Philippi, He could not be in Capernaum; He could not be everywhere at the same time. This flesh might have appeared in Galilee one day and in Judea the next, but it could not be in both places at the same time. God's life was restricted by time and space. This is why He felt pressed. His outward flesh had locked up His omnipresent and omnipotent life like a prisoner; it was no longer free. How pressed the omnipresent life was! What could the Lord do but be pressed? He was pressed because He had not died. After He died and resurrected, He was no longer pressed. Hence, there is a different aspect to the death of Christ, one in which He shed His body and released God's life. This is the baptism He was about to go through. This aspect of the Lord's death freed Him from the outward prison and released the fire, through which man received His life. This is the non-redemptive aspect of His death. It is different from the blood and the crucifixion. In the Bible this aspect of His death is signified by His flesh (John 6:54). Because of the limitation of time, I can only give a brief foundational word to show you the aspect of Christ's death which involves the release of His life.</p>
