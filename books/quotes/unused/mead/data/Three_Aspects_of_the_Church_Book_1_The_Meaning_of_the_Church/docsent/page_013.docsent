   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Oneness in Creation and the Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Restoration of the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see how God can head up all things through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to see this, we must first see the oneness of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The universe is basically one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything of the universe depends on oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The system of the universe is one, the source of the universe is one, and the center of the universe is also one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we ask experts in science, astronomy, geology, chemistry, biology, and physics, they will tell us that everything related to the universe depends on oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because the universe depends on God, and God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is oneness in the creation of the universe, and in this oneness there is no confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day, however, a rebellion occurred, and from that day, the universe was no longer one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was something else in the universe, and this brought confusion into the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The universe became chaotic because there was a rebel in the universe who desired to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He wanted to have a high position and to sit on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He exalted himself, aspiring to have the same rank as God, and thus disrupted the order of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, God cannot allow such confusion to continue; therefore, He will restore all things and head up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The original oneness in creation was ruined by Satan and needs to be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The restoration is carried out through the redemption of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the oneness of creation, there was only the power of God, not the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now in the restoration of oneness, that is, in redemption, there is not only the power of God but also the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The oneness of creation is natural, but the oneness of redemption is of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan brought the oneness of God s creation into death, but through redemption God brought this oneness into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God came to restore the oneness of creation, which was altered by death, through the oneness of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, God restored this oneness, and on the other hand, He added an additional component into this oneness the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God used His creating power to create the universe, all things were in harmony, not in chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Satan s rebellion ruined this oneness and brought this oneness into death so that the entire universe was brought into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, God came to restore oneness not by His power and handiwork but by His life, His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When this life enters into the believers, they become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 10:29-30 says, My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here God s hand is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 27 through 28 say, My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give to them eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here God s eternal life is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 16 says, I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here oneness is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Formerly, the Jews and the Gentiles could not be blended together, but now they have become one flock in the Father s life and in the Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This oneness is centered on life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are one not merely because God holds us and places us together but because His life is within us, making us one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First John 1:3 says, That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once this life is reported to us, it causes us to be one and to have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The oneness in redemption, in addition to the element of the oneness in creation, has the element of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The oneness in creation is under God s mighty hand; the oneness in redemption, however, begins with the life of God, though it also has the hand of God outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Satan injected the element of death into man, man has been damaged, has become impure, and is in total disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We were redeemed out of this disorderly situation when God s life entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though we are saved, we are still in disorder; therefore, we need God to work in us so that we will no longer be in disorder but will be restored to the oneness of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This restoration is not only by God s power but also by God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan ruined the oneness of creation by death, and God is restoring this oneness by life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan put death into all the creatures; now God is restoring all these things by life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, where there is death, there is disorder; where there is life, there is oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revelation 22:1 reveals that the New Jerusalem is a city in which there is a street of pure gold and a river of water of life that proceeds out of the unique throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From the picture of the New Jerusalem, we see that everything is one in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything related to the oneness of the New Jerusalem speaks of the golden nature of God and the flowing of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the New Jerusalem there is only one nature and one life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Consequently, in the New Jerusalem there is only one street and one river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This city is the ultimate issue of God s work of recovery by life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This recovery begins with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, God put His life into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the more this life functions and flows in the church, the more the oneness is recovered in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more this life functions to change the nature in the church, the more the oneness of the church is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to our feeling, there are many disorderly people, things, and matters in the church, but we must not rearrange them with our human hand, and it is useless for us to exhort the saints merely with words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, we must allow God s life to have a clear way to accomplish a transformation work in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church is transformed little by little, and the more the church is transformed, the more the situation of oneness is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>People in Christianity like to speak of unity, but the unity of which they speak is not the genuine oneness, the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The oneness of the church is manifested only in God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not allow God s life to transform us, we will never experience oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may be polite, and we may be humble, but this is not oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may be somewhat meek, and we may be somewhat forbearing, but this is not oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The oneness in the church issues out from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When God grows in His life, the result is the oneness of resurrection in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Such oneness is not the natural oneness of creation but the oneness of life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is correct to say that the oneness of resurrection is God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time, it is also correct to say that this oneness is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Fellowship is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can have fellowship and oneness only to the extent that we allow God s life in us to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Moreover, we should never forget that where the oneness is, there the Head is also.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Oneness can never be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Where there is oneness, there is the Head; where there is no oneness, there is no Head.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whenever there are many heads, there is no oneness, and their headship is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, whenever we live in the divine life, there is oneness and fellowship in us and in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At such a time, the Head is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Ephesians 1:10 says that God is heading up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is too great a verse, yet in our experience we are still able to touch, at least in part, the matter of God heading up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The heading up of all things in Christ is a recovery of life, a recovery of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Satan put death into all creatures, but the recovery work of God puts His life into His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Satan s death damaged the oneness of God s creation, but God s life recovers the oneness of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Where there is no life of God, there is death.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Death is the absence of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, the presence of God s life is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Resurrection equals oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, where God s life is, there is the oneness.</S>
