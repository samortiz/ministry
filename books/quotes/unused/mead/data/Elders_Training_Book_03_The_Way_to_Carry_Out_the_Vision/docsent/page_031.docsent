   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEAVING THE MEETING TO FORTUNE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the elders and all the seeking ones come to the meeting without this kind of preparation beforehand, they are leaving the entire meeting to fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you come to the meeting without being prepared you may offer a two second prayer such as, Lord, have mercy upon us and enrich the meeting, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, you have left the entire meeting to fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you see that nothing good is coming out in the meeting, by that time you will have nothing to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that all of us have come to a love feast, and nobody cooked anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everybody came empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have left the love feast to the god of fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may say, Do not say this Brother Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Did not the Lord use the five loaves and two small fish to feed five thousand, and still there were twelve baskets left over?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why couldn t the Lord do this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to your observation you may feel that I am short of faith and that my ways are too practical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Apostle Paul, however, had faith, but the real situation forced him to make tents to take care of the needs of himself and of the needs of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Did he not have the faith?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible never teaches us to have the kind of faith which does not require our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the teaching of superstition and the teaching of Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have a kind of faith in which eventually they lie to people and build up false miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One brother who was a missionary in Indonesia told us that the so-called changing of water into wine during a revival he attended was a great hoax.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not need to pretend in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord may perform a miracle, but I never heard that in the entire church history the Lord repeated the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand with five loaves and two fish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Also, we see in the book of Acts that the believers had everything in common for a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This did not work so well for a long time, so when the Apostle Paul came on the scene there was no longer such a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You still have to make a living by yourself and work with your own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not work, you should not eat 2 Thes 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To work properly, to gain more so that you can take care of the needy ones, is the proper going on for the long run in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not think that to get yourself prepared for the meeting is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is absolutely scriptural, but it depends on what way you prepare.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you go to the concordance and to the Scofield Reference Bible to pick up some points and some verses and put them together to get yourself prepared to give a long message, your message will make everybody sleepy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will be the best sleeping dose, and this is empty and killing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to our practice so far, we have the holy Word in our hand and by the Lord s mercy He has given us a publication that always opens up the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why would you not use this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to use these two things the Word and the opener to get ourselves prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot expect the entire congregation to prepare in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At least, however, we should expect ourselves, the leading ones, the co-workers, and the ones who take care of certain meetings, to prepare for the meeting in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our responsibility, our obligation, and our duty is to get ourselves prepared for the coming meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that if we would practice in this way, every kind of meeting would be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It would not be like some of our experience in the past, because in the past nobody actually bore the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church meeting actually is the meeting of the elders and all the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the elders and all the serving ones get themselves so prepared, the meeting will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the whole church comes together, this one may have a psalm, that one may have a teaching, and another may have a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They will not have it by instant inspiration, but they will have it by pre-readiness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You must prepare yourselves before the meeting time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through our experiences, we have the way to prepare ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To prepare yourself for the meeting is to get into the Word and to get into some messages which can help you to enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will be a rich preparation for you to take care of the meeting, and eventually the meeting will serve a dual purpose to nourish the saints and, for the long run, to educate the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>GROWING GRADUALLY BY LIFE AND BY THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While the issue of nourishment is forever, the nourishment itself only remains temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once the truth has been constituted into someone, however, it will remain there forever and its remaining is its supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our need for the long run is this kind of education with the truth, which is really something solid, living, and existing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not expect to have an overnight success which is like a factory making artificial flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Overnight you can produce many flowers, but in a genuine nursery or garden it takes time to grow flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not pick up the thought that we could do a quick work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may have the thought that within two years a great number of people will be added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Most of these people, however, may be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is mushrooming.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must take care of the church in a way of growing gradually by life and by truth.</S>
