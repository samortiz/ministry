In this series of messages, we want to see the move of God in man, which is God's history in His union with man in the New Testament
When we touch this matter, we have to be careful because in the Old Testament we do have some hints concerning God's appearing to people
In principle we need to see that God did not move in man in the Old Testament; He moved only with men and among men
God took a definite step to enter into man, and this laid a foundation for His move in man throughout the New Testament
The first page of the New Testament is on incarnation, and the last page of the New Testament is on the New Jerusalem
The New Testament opens with the genealogy of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1, and His genealogy is of forty-two generations
The genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 is a brief abstract of the Old Testament, which in itself is the detailed genealogy of Christ
We must not forget that the Old Testament was a preparation for the direct move of God in man in the New Testament
When they think of Christ's birth, they may think only of the manger or of the pagan things associated with the celebration of Christmas
We need to abandon our traditional, unscriptural concepts to see the pure revelation of the incarnated Triune God from the Holy Scriptures
Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived here on earth as a man, being limited even in the matter of time
He never had anything human before that time, but in His incarnation He entered into humanity and put on humanity as a part of His being
A heretical teaching in the past said that when divinity and humanity were mingled together, this produced a third element
The truth concerning divinity being mingled with humanity was present in the early days of the church with the church fathers
Because of the heretical and wrong teaching concerning mingling, few Christian teachers have dared to touch it again
The Holy Spirit mingles Himself with man to produce a meal offering which is good for food both to God and to His priests
Our redemption was accomplished by God the Son economically, but God the Father and God the Spirit also took part in this accomplishment
If a person goes to the bank to cash a check signed by another person, he must go there in the name of that person
In Luke 1:35 the angel told Mary that the Holy Spirit would come upon her as the power for her to conceive the holy child
When we say 'God's move in man,' we mean the Triune God's move in man, the move of the Three of the Divine Trinity
It is God coming into a man in His divinity to make Himself a part of that man and to make that man a part of Him
In the Christian life the husbands and the wives should love each other, but in their natural life they are not capable of doing this
Without Christ making Himself us and without us being made Christ, we cannot be humble and we cannot have any kind of Christian virtue
Every day as we live the Christian life, the Triune God is being incarnated by being made us and by making us Him
At the end of the Bible, the tree of life is the food and the water of life is the drink within the New Jerusalem
In the New Jerusalem, there is no need of the physical sun, because God the divine light will be shining there
Outside the New Jerusalem, the nations will still have the sun, but in the New Jerusalem we will have our unique sun God Himself
He is in us and we are in Him, but in order to enjoy Him continually, we must learn how to do everything according to the spirit
Romans 8:4 says that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us, who walk according to the spirit
Since the Lord's recovery has come to this country over thirty years ago, thousands of messages have been released through our ministry
Many of the saints in the recovery have received all the truths, yet they are short of the Spirit and of walking according to the spirit
We should make a decision that upon rising up early in the morning, we would not care for anything first except going to the Lord
During our time with the Lord, we should not allow ourselves to be disturbed by the telephone or by someone coming to our door
If we were having a time with the Lord in prayer, and there was a knock on our door, would we go to answer it?
We should have the attitude that when we are having such a time with the Lord, we are absent because we are fully occupied by God
In order to experience and enjoy Jesus, Jehovah our Savior, we must practice doing everything according to the spirit
Since the day we were saved, we put Him in a position as the guest within us instead of allowing Him to make His home within us
The realization that we should walk according to the spirit will restrict us and revolutionize our Christian life and church life
As a man at work in an office, the people around you should have the realization that you are a man plus something a man plus God!
We may be able to say that we become like God in life and nature but do we have the boldness to say that we become God in life and nature
Since we are born of God, we may say and even we should say that we are God in life and nature but not in the Godhead
He is the unique God for people to worship in His Godhead, but we are God only in life and in nature, not in the Godhead
Eventually when we speak something concerning Christ they all will realize that what we have as something more is Christ Himself that is God
Because of the wrong teaching of Eutyches in the fifth century most Christian teachers dare not to say that God and man are mingled together
Although oil and flour are mingled into one, they are still two in nature; they are not merged into one to become a third nature
When the branches of one tree are grafted into another tree, the two become one not just by joining but by mingling
The English word mingled means that two elements are combined together but that they remain distinguishable in their elements
The truth of mingling can also be seen in 1 Corinthians 6:17, which says that 'he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Without our union with Him and without being joined to Him, His substitutionary death could not be applied to us
Redemption mostly deals with the negative things, and salvation is mostly to supply us with the positive things
John 4:9 says that 'God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him'
The Bible does show us that we need to live for Christ and to live to Christ, but it also shows us that we need to live Christ
The word mingle means to combine two elements together to be one entity without a third element being produced
We have to pay our attention to His human living and fellowship about it because today we Christians are repeating His human living
We may have the boldness to say that Christ was God living a human life, but we would not say this about ourselves
The church cannot come into existence and be built up by the miraculous gifts and miracles according to the Pentecostal movement
You may think that the Christian life is a matter of learning how to imitate Christ and that you need to bear your cross to follow Him
In Philippians 278 Paul said that the Lord Jesus took the form of a slave became in the likeness of men and was found in fashion as a man
The horse of course, is in the form of the horse, having the outward appearance of a horse, but this form implies the reality of a horse
The man Jesus had the likeness of men, and all the people were observing Him, inspecting Him, and watching over Him
Mortal is versus eternal, finite is versus infinite, visible is versus invisible, and inglorious is versus glorious
God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and present everywhere, but man is limited in power, knowledge, and presence
Although He was the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived here on earth as a man, being limited even in the matter of time
When He loved people, that was a display of His human virtue, yet within that human virtue was the divine attribute as the reality
The real contents of the glove is the hand, just as the real contents of the human virtues of Christ are the divine attributes
In Christ's human living, the divine life was mingled with the human life to have one kind of living without a third entity
In His human living, Christ was God manifested in the flesh to express God in mercy, love, and grace and not in the condemnation of the law
Mercy is the source of God's love, and grace is the instrument of God's love, so mercy, love, and grace are actually one thing
When the jubilee comes, everyone old and young, male and female, strong and weak is released unconditionally and without exception
In His human living Christ proclaimed God's acceptable year of jubilee through the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth
In His human living, He was the Son of God anointed with the Holy Spirit, and He was with the presence of God the Father
On the other hand, He performed many miracles in power to defeat God's enemy and to release all the oppressed ones
He was a descendant of the royal family of David, but at His time David's royal family had become a poor family, the dry ground
The angel told the shepherds, 'This will be the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger'
From the time that He became a minister of God, He also became a man of sorrows, suffering the despising, rejection, and persecution of man
After He became thirty years old, He was tempted by the devil, and this temptation was under the leading of the Spirit of God
A key verse concerning God's incarnation is Matthew 1:20, which says, 'That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit'
In this message we want to see the third major step of the move of God in man, and this step was His move in the crucifixion of Christ
The previous messages concerning the move of God in man were entitled In His Incarnation and In His Human Living
Jesus said to them, 'I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me'?
The Jews answered Him, 'We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God'
No one could crucify God if He remained in His divinity, but Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh was crucified
Since the manifestation of Christ was God's manifestation in the flesh, the crucifixion of Christ was also God's crucifixion
Since we can say and do say that God was manifested in the flesh, we also can say that God was crucified in the flesh
God bought, purchased, the church with His own blood, so the church is so dear, so beloved, in the feeling of God and in the eyes of God
He was impressing the elders from Ephesus that they should love the church, considering the church very dear and beloved as God does
As we have pointed out, Charles Wesley wrote a very good hymn with a good melody, in which he spoke of the crucifixion of Christ
In John 1:29 'sin' is a total term, implying both the inward sin in our nature and the outward sins, trespasses, in our conduct
Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ, and in Galatians 2:20a Paul said, 'I am crucified with Christ'
Hebrews 2:9 says that Christ tasted death for all things, and Colossians 1:20 says that through His death, He reconciled all things to God
In His crucifixion, Christ abolished the law in ordinances and slew the enmity between peoples, especially between the Jews and the Gentiles
Satan and the fallen angels died there, God died there, man died there, the world died there, and the entire old creation died there
On the positive side, He released the divine life through His death for the producing of the believers to constitute the Body of Christ
When we look at human history with the world situation, we must have another view, the biblical view with the spiritual insight
God was there to crucify the old man to destroy Satan the power of death to judge and crucify the world and to taste death for all things
Even many Christians do not have a view to see that God accomplished seven items on the negative side plus one item on the positive side
In the crucifixion of Christ, God wiped out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, contrary to us, and nailed it to the cross
While the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, many women who had followed Him were looking on from a distance
They saw only the Roman soldiers' nailing Him on the cross, but they did not see that God was also nailing the law there
In 2 Corinthians 12 Paul said that he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which were not allowed for a man to speak
In quoting the Bible to prove a point it is always best to have two or three verses because this is a matter of testimony
Since the manifestation of Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, the crucifixion of Christ is also the crucifixion of God
Matthew 27:46 says, 'And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
At the very juncture when the Lord Jesus was going to give up His spirit, He cried, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
The First dwells in the Second, the Second dwells in the Third, and the Third dwells in the First and the Second
Economically speaking, that is, according to God's economy, God's plan, and God's accomplishing of His purpose, the three are distinct
At the time of His baptism, the Father was in the heavens, the Son was in the water, and the Spirit was in the air like a dove
When They act to carry out Their economy, to finish Their plan, to accomplish Their purpose, quite often They are distinct
The Gospels also show us that the Son prayed to the Father, and when He prayed, He lifted up His eyes to heaven
Essentially speaking, the crucifixion of Christ was God's crucifixion, but at the juncture when Christ gave up His spirit, God forsook Him
Not only the things on the earth but also the things in the heavens needed to be reconciled to God through Christ's blood
The whole creation needs to be freed from the slavery of corruption, so the whole creation needs Christ's redemption
Christ died on the cross for all the items of the creation so that He could reconcile all these items back to God
The tabernacle and all things pertaining to it were sprinkled with and purified by the blood of goats and bulls
Heaven and all things in heaven were defiled by the rebellion of Satan and the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God
Now we need to consider how we can prove that when Christ was suffering death on the cross, God was busy there
Verse 15 says that He also stripped off the rulers and the authorities and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross
While Christ was being crucified, the evil angels came in to frustrate God, and there was a struggle between them
Sin does have these two aspects: the inward aspect, the sin in our nature, and the outward aspect, the sin in our conduct
Christ died on the cross not only for our transgressions, wrongdoings, mistakes, offenses, but also for our sinful nature
When we say that Christ destroyed the devil on the cross, someone may ask us how the devil can continue to work
The verdict of the law court is one thing, but the execution of the verdict, the sentence, the judgment, is another thing
Those who have been in the Lord for years know that Satan has been judged and that God has pronounced, or proclaimed, His verdict
We have to execute God's judgment over Satan continually until the day that he is actually cast into the lake of fire
In order to fight the spiritual warfare in this way, we need much teaching, perfecting, and growth in the divine life
In the eyes of the worldly people, including many of our relatives, our schoolmates, and our friends, we are finished
Finally in the positive aspect of His death He released the divine life for the producing of the believers to constitute the Body of Christ
In this message we want to see the move of God in man in the move of Christ during His burial and in the resurrection of Christ
Most Christian readers of the New Testament do not pay adequate and proper attention to this portion of the Word
When Christ was crucified on the cross, on the one hand, He was killed physically, but on the other hand, He was made alive spiritually
Pember's teaching in his book entitled Earth's Earliest Ages, where he strongly proved that the sons of God in Genesis 6 were fallen angels
When Christ was crucified, on the one hand, His body was killed; on the other hand, God renewed, empowered, His spirit
It also shows us that even at the time Christ was buried, He was busy to proclaim God's victory in Him to the rebellious angels
The Bible tells us clearly that in this universe there are the heavens, the earth, and Hades, which is underneath the earth
Paul was brought to the third heaven and to Hades, and he received visions and revelations of these hidden regions
When he was caught away into Paradise the pleasant section of Hades he heard unspeakable words which it is not allowed for a man to speak
Christ went to these rebellious angels to proclaim God's victory accomplished through His death in the flesh on the cross
On the one hand, men killed Christ's body; on the other hand, Christ committed His spirit into the hands of God
The proclamation of Christ, of His victory for God on the cross, was proclaimed to those rebellious angels as a shame to them
In light of this, consider how much more difficult it is to understand the mysterious death and burial of Christ
The resurrection of Christ proves that God's requirements on us sinners were satisfied by the death of Christ for us
Christ's death has fulfilled the requirement of God's holiness, the requirement of God's righteousness, and the requirement of God's glory
We are justified by God because of Christ's death, and in Christ, the resurrected One, we are accepted before Him
In Christ's resurrection God justified us and put the resurrected One into us as a sign of God's acceptance of us
He also makes the resurrected Christ live within us a life that can be justified by Him and that is always acceptable to Him
The 'receipt' of God's requirements being satisfied by the death of Christ and of our being justified is the resurrection of Christ
Also, this resurrected One enters into you to live in you that you may live a life which is always justified by God and accepted by God
The resurrection of Christ is for our justification, and our justification is for our past and for our present
In the resurrection of Christ, God also made Christ, who was the last Adam in the flesh, the life-giving Spirit
Most Christians today in reading the Bible do not care for these mysterious, invisible steps of God's move in man
The fact of our regeneration took place almost two thousand years ago, but we experienced this fact when we were saved
One day He was killed and that killing on the cross broke His human shell to release the divine life within Him
Resurrection formed the base of God's move in the ascension of Christ for the formation of the church, the Body of Christ
It was in His ascension that He formed all the regenerated members, produced in His resurrection, into His one organic Body
God empowers the believers with the power of Christ's resurrection for the conformation to His death in the believers' Christian walk
Christ not only accomplished an all-inclusive death for us but also completed an all-surpassing resurrection for us
We need to go further to see how the resurrection of Christ is related to us and how God moves in us in the resurrection of Christ
Surely the Christian life is related to the Spirit, but we need to see that the Spirit is the reality of the resurrection of Christ
We can see the period of time between the Lord's death and His resurrection by considering the final days of His life on this earth
In the morning the Lord Jesus was sentenced to death by Pilate, and He was brought to Calvary to be crucified there
He was buried in a new tomb for a full day and then resurrected early in the morning on the first day of the week
He was away from the disciples a short time so that He could pass through death to usher Himself into resurrection
When He breathed Himself into the disciples as the lifegiving Spirit that was to bring all the disciples out of death into His resurrection
What they received was the resurrection, and resurrection is the processed and consummated Triune God, the pneumatic Christ
Before the Lord's death, Peter had boasted that he would never deny the Lord , but later he took the lead to deny Him
In John 21 the Lord was training Peter to live according to the new part of his being, the part of resurrection
In Acts 1 Peter was altogether in resurrection with the one hundred twenty, which included the sisters and the Lord's flesh brothers
Your character must be built up in resurrection, and character is built up mainly in the sundry things, the small things in your daily life
After working at a desk, some of us would leave the things on our desk in disarray and would not put our chair under the desk
After the Lord fed the five thousand, He charged the disciples to gather the leftovers, and they filled twelve baskets full
If we were the ones who had been resurrected, we would have been very excited, leaving everything in the tomb a mess
Resurrection is the very living God who has been consummated to be the life-giving Spirit to live in us a life in order
When we live in the resurrection of Christ, the processed God is living in us, so that is a part of God's move in humanity
The real resurrection is the consummated Triune God, the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive, compounded Spirit
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit as the resurrection, and this Spirit has the bountiful supply which enables us to live Christ
By electrical power a room can be made bright with light, and the volume of someone's speaking can be increased through a microphone
When we live, not in the natural life or in the fallen flesh, but in the resurrection of Christ, God operates in us
If we do things in resurrection in a good order many virtues will be exhibited and those virtues are the expression of the divine attributes
We live in and by resurrection, so God lives in our living that we may become Him in all His attributes as our virtues for His manifestation
These Christian virtues are expressions of the divine attributes and are the manifestation of God in the flesh
Upon the foundation laid in the Lord's earthly ministry, all the additional works are to be done in His heavenly ministry
In the beginning of Christ's move in ascension, He poured out Himself as the economical Spirit to start the building up of the church
That thousand-year period will conclude God's holy work for His new creation, and the New Jerusalem will be consummated
After the one thousand years, God's work in the age of the old creation to gain His new creation in full is ultimately finished
He is in the heavens doing a lot, but today's Christians do not pay adequate attention to this part of Christ's ministry
If something is taking place in Hong Kong, we can see it on television at the same time here in the United States
Christ is working in the heavens, and at the same time He is also working in us according to the heavenly television
The Lord gave Israel the good land in the Old Testament, but Israel was not faithful to fully possess that land
After thirty-three and a half years, when He ascended to the heavens, God officially made Him the very Christ of God
When Christ entered into His ascension, God made Him officially the Christ, the Anointed One of God to carry out God's economy
Acts 531 says that Christ was exalted to Gods right hand as a Leader and Revelation 15 says that He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth
Eventually, however, he was exiled, and he acknowledged that Jesus was above him and belonged to a different class
He admitted that he founded his empire upon force as a mere man but that Jesus founded His empire upon love and was more than a man
He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for God's chosen people to receive His salvation
Many of us were born in different countries and at different times, but today we have become fellow citizens in the kingdom of God
His divinity as the Son of God constitutes Him as our eternal High Priest, so He can pray for us both in heaven and in us
In His ascension Christ is the Minister of the new covenant to minister all the riches of the bequests of the New Testament
All the items of the blessings of the new testament are bequests, and Christ is the Minister of the riches of these bequests
Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens and the Spirit, the Comforter , within us as our Advocate, who takes care of our case
Christ is the great Shepherd, the Chief Shepherd, to take care of God's flock and be the Overseer of our souls
As the Advocate He prays for us and that is God's praying, so that is God's move in us as a part of God's history
Actually, Christ, the ascended Savior as the Lord of all in the universe, is the Head over all things to the church
He is quite qualified, quite capable, to take care of the church in every way to meet the church's need in different situations
Ephesians 2:6 says that God raised us up together with Christ and 'seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus'
We may have the thought that Ephesians 2:6 says that we are seated with Christ in the heavens, but it does not say this
Note 64 on Ephesians 2 in the Recovery Version says, 'The heavenlies are the highest position, into which we have been saved in Christ
In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into a position in which we are above all God's enemies
It is more significant that Christ today is ministering in His ascension in the heavenlies than in the heavens
We may think that our Christian life is our autobiography, but actually it is God's writing of His autobiography
For all the other eleven statuses of Christ mentioned previously, He needs the qualification of being in the heavens in ascension
Whenever we are gathered together into His name, Christ is there with all His members in ascension, and this is God's move within man
The Father is the Dweller, the Spirit is the instrument, and the Son is the very presence within us day by day
We should always have the presence of the Son with the consciousness of the Spirit as the instrument and the Father as the Dweller
In Christ's ascension God is operating in us both the willing within and the working without for His good pleasure
He is the unique God for people to worship in His Godhead, but we are made God only in life and in nature, not in the Godhead
Even though Peter was only a fisherman without any kind of scholastic attainment, he was able to write such a marvelous word
The place where we should be is the divine glory which is now being built up by Gods perfecting establishing strengthening and grounding
In this message the stress is not the building of the church by Christ, but on the source, the initiation, of the building
Christ does not build the church directly, nor do the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
The gifted persons perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry, that is, the work of building up the Body of Christ
The initiator gave the instructions and motivated the building work, but the eighty brothers actually did the work
Still, it is God in His Trinity who moves in these perfected members in their carrying out of the work of building
The believers of Christ grow up in all things into Him, the Head, and out from Him all the Body grows unto the building up of itself
When we were building the meeting hall in Anaheim, the little children were not allowed to help because it was too dangerous
We, the small members of the Body, build the church with the bountiful supply that we have received from the Head
We grow into Christ, the Head; then out from Him we receive the nourishment, the supply, to grow unto the building up of the Body of Christ
All the time we need to turn to our spirit, where God operates, where God increases, and where God grows to be the material of our building
Some Christians consider that the way to build up the church is to have a capable pastor who is knowledgeable, eloquent, and very friendly
When such a capable, eloquent, and knowledgeable one dies or resigns, after a short time that social unit may collapse
Because of our different characters, dispositions, intentions, and opinions, it is difficult for us to be blended
Corinthians 12:6 says, 'And there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all'
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
The new heaven replaces the old heaven, the new earth replaces the old earth, and the new man replaces the old man
Paul says in Galatians 6:15 that circumcision or uncircumcision means nothing; what matters is the new creation
The New Jerusalem will be the aggregate of God's new creation, and the new creation in the New Testament is also called the new man
God completed His work of the old creation with the heavens, the earth, and man in the first two chapters of Genesis
Beginning from chapter three of Genesis, the entire old creation of God became corrupted, contaminated, and fallen
Although we are the new creation, we are also being renewed and transformed to become the new creation in a fuller way
We need to cooperate with God's operation in us by exercising our spirit to function by speaking in the meetings
God worked in Genesis with Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that work was the work of God's new creation
The Holy Spirit, mentioned in the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus, is for sanctifying humanity for Christ's incarnation
He told them that on the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in the Father, that they were in Him, and that He was in them
Peter was so strong to tell the Lord that even if all the others would be stumbled, he would never be stumbled
The Lord had to put His mercy aside for a time so that Peter's natural strength and self-confidence could be dealt with
God works throughout all the successive generations to gain the New Jerusalem as the final product of His new creation work
Today as we grow in Him and He grows in our growth, He is arriving at His goal to consummate His new creation work
They did not desire to live in a city in their age because they eagerly waited for the city to come, the New Jerusalem
In Hebrews 12:22 we are told that we, the New Testament believers, are coming forward to that heavenly city, the heavenly Jerusalem
As we have already mentioned, the New Testament believers come forward to something which is already in existence
Revelation 3:12 tells us that in the millennium, in the thousand-year kingdom, the New Jerusalem will descend out of heaven from God
In the manifestation of the kingdom in the New Jerusalem, the overcoming believers will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Hebrews 11:40 shows that the Old Testament saints cannot obtain what God promised apart from the New Testament believers
At the end of the age of grace, a good number of the New Testament saints will be matured to be the overcomers
In order to obtain and enjoy this, the Old Testament overcomers need the New Testament overcomers to perfect them
He is making them mature to arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
In Ephesians 4 we see that we are growing up into the Head in all things and that all the Body causes the growth of the Body
Between the rapture of the firstfruits and the harvest will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation
During the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Antichrist will set up his image, forcing all the people on earth to worship him
The believers who were not overcomers will suffer a dispensational punishment during the thousand-year kingdom
The New Jerusalem is built up by God's progressive, gradual work from Adam to the last believer of the New Testament
The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth is the ultimate consummation which is revealed in the last two chapters of the Bible
The New Jerusalem will be the eternal habitation of God constituted with the Triune God and with God's redeemed people
The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for the redeemed saints to dwell in
In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for God and man for eternity
The holy city, New Jerusalem, is the greatest sign in the book of Revelation as the organism of the Triune God in eternity
