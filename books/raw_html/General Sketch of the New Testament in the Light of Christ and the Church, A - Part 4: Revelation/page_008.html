 <h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</h2>
<p>The seventh stage of the church is symbolized by the church in Laodicea (3:14-22). Today some wrongly teach that the church in Laodicea represents the fallen, cold reformed churches. However, if we thoroughly study the history of the church, we will see that Laodicea represents the degraded Brethren. In this epistle the Lord did not rebuke them for anything except spiritual pride. There is no mention of sinfulness or the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, or the teaching of Jezebel. There was no problem with them except their pride. They claimed to be wealthy and rich and to have need of nothing, but in actuality they were neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm (vv. 15-17a).</p>
<p>The Brethren had a very good start over a century ago, but after about twenty-five years, many of them fell into degradation. When we attend their meetings in Europe, England, or America, we can sense the fulfillment of this epistle. We thank the Lord that some of them are still in the condition of Philadelphia, but not many are. They are spiritually proud and rich in knowledge, but they do not have much spiritual experience. They do not have much living faith or the eyesalve for their eyes that they may see the spiritual things. They have even lost the presence of the Lord; the Lord is outside their door (v. 20).</p>
<p>In the reformed churches there is still the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and even to some extent the teaching of Jezebel. In Laodicea, however, we cannot find these things. Therefore, Laodicea represents not the reformed churches but the degraded Brethren, who are fallen not due to sin but due to pride. They say, &ldquo;We know what is taught in Genesis, and we know what is taught in Revelation. We have a great teacher who gave an exposition of Daniel and other teachings. Who can know more than we do?&rdquo; In this way they have become proud, being rich in knowledge and right in doctrines. However, the Lord says that they are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked (v. 17b). They do not have much experience of the Lord, they do not have much living faith, and their eyes are not truly opened but are blinded by doctrines. They have the mental knowledge and the doctrines, but they do not have light in their spirit. Therefore, they need to pay the price (v. 18).</p>
<p>If we read the epistle to Laodicea again, and if we visit the Brethren assemblies, we will have to admit that this is the exact fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in the seventh epistle. This is the real Laodicea, with lukewarmness, the blindness of knowledge in the mentality, and the lack of anything living. Then we will say, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHOOSING TO BE THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA</h2>
<p>Please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/GenSketch4/systematic-chart.pdf">systematic chart of church history</a> at the beginning of this chapter, taken from <em>The Orthodoxy of the Church</em> by Watchman Nee. As this chart indicates, the stages of the church represented by Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos have all concluded. None of these three churches exists today. However, the church in Thyatira, the fourth stage of the course of the church, exists today and will remain until the end of this age. In the epistle to Thyatira the Lord clearly indicates that this church will remain until He comes (2:25). Today the Roman Catholic Church not only exists but is flourishing. In addition, the church in Sardis, the reformed church, will also exist until the Lord&rsquo;s coming (3:3). Likewise, Philadelphia and Laodicea will also remain until the Lord&rsquo;s return (v. 11).</p>
<p>Today, before the Lord&rsquo;s return, four kinds of churches remain before us&mdash;the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, the church of brotherly love, and the degraded Brethren. If we were born five hundred years ago, there would have been no choice before us; there was only one kind of church. After the Reformation, however, there were two kinds of churches. Then as of about one hundred forty years ago, there were three kinds. Today in this century there are four choices related to the church. Of course, we may all agree that we can have nothing to do with Thyatira, but some people still argue for Sardis. Strictly speaking, though, Sardis should not be a choice. Can you be satisfied to be a part of Sardis? I left Sardis in 1927. In actuality, only two kinds of churches remain before us. Will we be the church in brotherly love, or will we be Laodicea? Once we become Philadelphia, we can never again be Sardis, but we must be careful that we do not become Laodicea.</p>
<p>Although Ephesus lost its first love, it remained at the level of normality, as indicated by the first part of the systematic chart. Therefore, the church in Ephesus was still good, desirable, and lovable. After this, Smyrna, the suffering church, also continued at the level of normality. However, at the time of Pergamos, the church became abnormal, and Thyatira continued the same trend. Sardis turned back to the normal level but came only halfway. The writings of Luther tell us that Luther himself was not satisfied with the Reformation, although regrettably many of his followers were satisfied. We praise the Lord that Philadelphia came all the way back to the level of normality. However, not long afterwards it degraded and fell below the level of normality. This systematic chart is a clear diagram showing us the real situation of Christianity today.</p>
<p>All four kinds of churches before us will remain until the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Now we must ask ourselves which of the four we will choose. I believe we are all clear as to which is the one that will satisfy the Lord.</p>
