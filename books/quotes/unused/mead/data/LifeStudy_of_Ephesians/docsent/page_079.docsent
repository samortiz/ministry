   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NO LONGER STRANGERS AND SOJOURNERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to verse 19: So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse covers two aspects of the church: the kingdom, indicated by the term fellow-citizens, and the family of God, indicated by the phrase the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 19 says that we, the Gentiles, are no longer strangers and sojourners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word you in this verse refers to the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Strangers are aliens, and sojourners are foreigners sojourning among the Israelites without the right of citizenship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both refer to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now that we are no longer strangers and sojourners, we are fellow-citizens of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The term fellow-citizens indicates the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, are citizens of God s kingdom, which is a sphere wherein God exercises His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as anyone is a believer, he is a citizen of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This citizenship involves rights and responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We enjoy the rights of the kingdom, and we bear the responsibilities of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two things always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, as citizens of the United States, we enjoy certain rights, but we must also fulfill our responsibility to pay taxes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 19 reveals that we are also members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This phrase indicates the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both the Jewish and Gentile believers are members of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s house is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers were born of God into His house to enjoy His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s kingdom is a matter of rights and responsibility; all believers who were born into the house of God have the civil rights of and bear responsibility in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such a short verse two profound matters are covered: the kingdom of God with its rights and responsibilities and the house of God with its enjoyment of the Father s life and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>X. THE SAINTS, THE HOUSE OF GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 19 speaks of the saints, the house of God, and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The saints are individuals, but the house of God is corporate and results in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there were no house, there could be no kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Firstly we are saints, individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then, corporately, we are the house of God resulting in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we have both the individual aspect of the Christian life and the corporate aspect in the house of God and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 19 why does the Apostle Paul refer to the kingdom of God before the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul s thought here concerns our former status as strangers and sojourners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Strangers and sojourners are related to a kingdom, not to a household.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who are aliens in this country are not aliens in relation to a family, but in relation to the nation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because strangers and sojourners are aliens to kingdoms, not to families, Paul mentions the kingdom first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse Paul s main concept is that of citizenship in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The kingdom, however, is composed of families.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, Paul also mentions the household of God, that is, the family of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 19 there is the thought of intimacy, seen in the term fellow- citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As unsaved Gentiles, we once were far off from God and the commonwealth of Israel, but now we have an intimate relationship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of God s household.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Among the citizens of the United States, there is a certain intimacy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this intimacy cannot compare with that among members of a family.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Jews and the Gentiles are not only citizens of the same kingdom, but also folks of the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to regard the saints in an intimate way as our folks.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being members of the family of God must not only be our doctrine, but also our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the universe God has just one household, one family.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No matter what our background may be, as believers we all are members of God s unique universal family, and all the saints are our folks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not take this matter lightly, but consider it seriously as an important aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What an intimate relationship we have in the household of God!</S>
