<p>At the end of Revelation, there are a promise and a call. The promise is verse 14 of chapter 22: &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life.&rdquo; This is the last promise of the whole Bible. The last call in the Bible is verse 17 of the same chapter. In this verse the Spirit and the bride say, &ldquo;Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; Thus, the whole Bible ends with one promise and one call. The promise is to have the right to eat, and the call is to drink the water of life. These things are much better, much higher, and much more profound than the ten horns and seven heads in the book of Revelation. This is because we are speaking about the heart of the divine revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WARNING CONCERNING DOCTRINES</h2>
<p>It is very meaningful to see that in Revelation 2 and 3, on the positive side, the Lord Jesus promised again and again about eating. But on the negative side, in these chapters, He warned us again and again about teaching, or doctrine. In 2:14 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam.&rdquo; Then in verse 15 He said, &ldquo;In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&rdquo; In verses 20 and 24 the Lord Jesus warned about the teaching of Jezebel. To teach is not to feed but to just pass on knowledge or doctrine. It is so good not to have the doctrines, because the Lord Jesus appreciates this. On the positive side, there is the eating. On the negative side, there is the doctrine. This shows that the Lord Jesus is just for eating. He is not for doctrines.</p>
<p>Some would say that the Lord hates these doctrines because they are the wrong ones. But my argument is this: How do you know that your doctrine is the right one? If you know that the doctrine you hold is wrong, surely you will not hold it. Let us take money as an illustration. Only the experts are able to detect counterfeit money. The best thing is to possess gold. Otherwise, you can be cheated. Likewise, the best way for you not to be cheated is not to take any doctrine. You really may not know the difference between the genuine doctrine and the wrong doctrine. But as long as it is doctrine, you should not take it. Instead, you should want the gold. The gold is the reality. I do not care for &ldquo;currency.&rdquo; I care for &ldquo;gold.&rdquo; I care only for Christ. I do not care for any doctrine.</p>
<p>In the last book of the Bible, the Lord Jesus would not care for any doctrine, any teaching. He cares only for eating, not the eating of doctrines but the eating of Himself as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast. This is the last book, and the last book is the final word. The Bible is a long discourse from God that took over fifteen hundred years to complete. In any long talk, the final word is the most crucial. Revelation, as the final word of God&rsquo;s long discourse, talks about the eating of Jesus, and it rejects and belittles all the doctrines. We need to forget about the doctrines and hold on to the eating of Jesus.</p>
<p>Do not forget that this word about eating was not spoken to any individuals. It was spoken to the churches. &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&rdquo; (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). You need to be in the churches. Then you can hear what the Spirit says. Care only for the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking. Do not care for doctrines. We need to eat the Lord today. We do not have the full taste yet, but the foretaste is here. Day by day we take the foretaste, and the foretaste is qualifying us for and will lead us to the full taste. In the full taste we again have the tree of life and the river of life. Again we have the eating and drinking of Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Out of the eating and drinking, you will become stones, and the stones are not scattered or piled up. All the stones are built up. The wall of the holy city is built with stones. These stones are produced from the eating and the drinking of Jesus.</p>
<p>Now you can see how consistent the entire Bible is with the matter of eating to produce the building. Even in Genesis 2 there is the revelation of eating the tree of life. There is also the flowing of the river, and the issue of the flow is the precious materials&mdash;gold, bdellium (pearl), and the onyx stone (vv. 9-12). That means that all the precious materials are produced out of the flow of the life river.</p>
<p>Now we all have to see that this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of the eating of Jesus for the building up of the church. This is not only for this age but also for eternity. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Open our eyes that we all may see Your purpose today, Your recovery today, and the goal of Your recovery today.&rdquo; We need to eat Jesus to grow, to be transformed, and to be built together. Then we will have the building of the church.</p>
<p>By this way the Lord is going to fulfill His prophecy regarding the building up of the church. This prophecy is fulfilled by eating Jesus. Never forget that eating unites. Eating keeps the oneness. Eating builds up. If you are divisive, that means you are wrong in the matter of eating. If you are right in the matter of eating, surely you will be united and even uniting. You will be the ones who are built and who are building others. When will the Lord build His church? Now! How will the Lord build His church? By our eating Jesus!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
