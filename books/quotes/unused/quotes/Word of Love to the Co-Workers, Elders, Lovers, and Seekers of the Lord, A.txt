If each regenerated believer would bear one fruit yearly, within less than twenty years, the entire world would be saved
After almost two thousand years of church history, today's situation related to fruit-bearing is far short of what it should be
Since the end of World War II, the Muslim religion, not Christianity, has been the religion with the most increase
Man's multiplication, man's fruit-bearing, is not by mass production but by individual persons bearing children to have a family
The evangelists in Christianity have big gospel campaigns to convert many people, but where are those people today?
We may bring several thousand people together to hear the gospel, and take many names, but how many of them do we really gain practically?
We may say that whether they remain in the church or not, they are still saved persons, but this is not practical
Since thousands of fish are passing around us day by day, how can we say that we cannot catch one of them within one year?
Two great heretical groups in the United States, the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses, depend almost entirely upon door-knocking
Some of us have only been going out for three weeks or three months without gaining one person and then say that door-knocking does not work
My burden in this message, however, is how to work on the campus and how to have the brothers' and sisters' homes in particular
The goal of those who catch and gain new ones on the campuses is to bring them into the brothers' and sisters' homes
Recently in Orange County the number of young people in corporate living has been reducing in number, not increasing
The first division among the Brethren was between John Nelson Darby and George Muller over a discrepancy of opinions
George Muller disagreed, pointing out his friend, Hudson Taylor, who was the founder of the China Inland Mission
The Closed Brethren went too far, even saying that if a husband and wife held different opinions, they should not eat together
Others, however, say that the believers should simply leave this matter to the Lord and let Him take care of it
When we practiced the church life according to Brother Nee's teaching and according to the Bible, we also faced these problems
She washed our clothes for us on the Lord's Day, she prepared better meals on that day, and she brought us to her church
If our raising of our children could decide their spiritual future, this would be against God's predestination
According to my observation in Taipei it is better not to exercise any demand on the young people who live in our brothers and sisters homes
We thank the Lord that we have the brothers' and sisters' homes as 'fishing hooks,' and some young people have been hooked
The brothers' and sisters' homes may have a regulation that says everyone must return home and turn off their lights by 10:00 P
Ephesians 6:4 says, 'Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord'
If one is offended by his child, he becomes a provocation to him, and he loses his capacity to discipline the child
One day Hall Three in the church in Taipei had a time with all the parents of the ones who lived in the brothers' and sisters' homes
When school opens, the brothers and sisters also go to the campus to set up a table and get the names of the freshmen
We should have some homes for those in their first year, and gradually we can advance from there up to the fourth year
Those who have stayed with us for several years have been growing in the Lord, and they can now live a corporate life
We cannot avoid a feeling of superiority among the young people just as the students in high school feel superior about being in high school
The brothers who are elders in the United States are probing for the way to be good elders, but they do not know what to do
For practical reasons, we have a manager in the Living Stream Ministry office, but there is no rank in this office
There is much profit for brothers from one part of the country to visit another, not to teach or merely to learn but simply to observe
To me, shepherding means everything for the brothers' and sisters' homes, for the vital groups, for the church, and for the elders
We may do the work of the ministry, but the unfitting manner in which we behave and conduct ourselves kills our ministry
Recently, a graduate student in a certain university attacked his three professors because they would not pass him
We are taking care of the brothers' and sisters' homes, but how do we conduct ourselves, how do we behave, and what way do we take?
Ephesians is a very high book, but it comes down to say, 'Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation'
In 10:10 He says, 'I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly,' and in verse 11 He says, 'I am the good Shepherd'
Even in our human life, family life, and marriage life there is the need of shepherding, and shepherding requires cherishing
In this message we will fellowship concerning how we should learn of the Lord to shepherd people according to His heart
If we hate each other, we will have endless strife, but love covers not only one sin or some sins, but all sins
We would rather be like the sons of Noah who covered their father's nakedness which was due to his drunkenness
Those who uncover suffer the curse, but those who cover others' sins, defects, and shortcomings enjoy, gain, and receive blessing
Forgiven in verse 15, as in Psalm 32:1, which says, 'Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven; / Whose sin is covered'
The heart of our God is to love not only righteous men but sinners, even the world, which is worse than mere sinners
The entire human race became the world, just as the entire divine race, the new race, will become the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is the totality the consummation of the eternal life while the world is the totality the consummation of the fallen race
Because all the people on this earth became flesh, God decided to temporarily forsake the world, which He loved, for a purpose
The world indicates man becoming one with Satan, becoming Satan's cosmos, the satanic system that systematizes all people
That is right, and there is nothing wrong with this, but the goal of having the divine life is the New Jerusalem
God loved the human race, the worst human people, with the intention that they all may participate in the New Jerusalem
In the beginning there is God as the eternal life, and the consummation of God as the eternal life is the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is still under a consummating work, and this consummating work is the flow of the divine life
John 4:10 says, 'Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins'
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?
He enjoyed that time, and all the tax collectors and sinners, the ancient 'gangsters,' joined together with Him
If one is healthy enough to live properly in corporate living, he does not need a vital group as a 'health clinic'
As all the Chinese know, the second day of the Chinese New Year is a day of rottenness, gambling, and all manner of entertainment
Rather, he visited me, and one day very mysteriously the seeking Spirit was seeking in me, like the woman in Luke 15
That is why He was there among the sinners and tax collectors, eating and feasting with them, reclining at the table and enjoying with them
We need to be discipled to have the divine concept the concept of the Fathers heart and the heart of the Lord Jesus who came to save sinners
As the final item of the way to overcome the degradation of the church, 2 Timothy 4:22 says, 'The Lord be with your spirit
We should not say that we are the class of people who live with the Lord, walk with the Lord, and work with the Lord
Some may claim that they are the class of saints who are able to live in corporate living, but in actuality and practicality they are not
In the eyes of God, everyone is not lovable in themselves, yet God still loves them; that is, He loves the world
According to their statistics, the Jehovah's Witnesses knock on six thousand doors to visit people in order to gain one
God wants us to be the God-men at the top of the heavenly ladder, but we may not even be on the first rung of the ladder
They simply need to go back and be more conformed to the death of Christ and to live the divine life by denying themselves
Similarly, we may say that we are able to live in corporate living, but eventually we will find out that we are not
You may want to be an emperor in your district, with everything under your control and rule and where everyone must listen to you
He accepts my ministry, and he receives standing orders of the books of the Living Stream Ministry even until today
No one is of Cephas, no one is of Apollos, no one is of Paul, the highest apostle, and no one is even of Christ separately from others
He may like to charm them and captivate them and if he succeeds in captivating others the captivated ones become members of his little party
We do not have fruit because we are lacking in the Father's loving and forgiving heart and the Son's shepherding and seeking spirit
The Pharisees and scribes brought a sinful woman to the Lord and said, 'In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women
They charged the Lord to say something, so He said, 'He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her'
Matthew 16:24 says, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
To not conform to the death of Christ is to not absolutely deny your self, not others' self, and bear the cross
A person may boast of his race or that he is from a certain country with a prideful spirit and an air of superiority
If we deal with these four matters the Lords recovery will immediately have a revival and within one month we will see fruit as the result
Some coworkers were ambitious intending to gain a place or a person using my name to give people the impression that Brother Lee sent them
Intensification is not only to give you more of the Spirit; it is also to cause you to be conformed sevenfold to the death of Christ
Verse 5 says When we see the ripened harvest Of the golden countryside We may know that many seeds have Fallen to the earth and died
They can make you more ambitious because they give you more capacity, and they can make you prouder because you now have the high peaks
In the Old Testament the people were not allowed to put honey in the meal offering; rather, they put in salt, which kills germs
Our full-time training should not have a purpose to keep the trainees in Anaheim to do a work in Anaheim or in Southern California
Some like to keep more people on the campuses in Southern California, but what about the campuses in other countries?
Some like to keep the good ones in their own city, and they complain that the training assigns too many good ones to the other cities
You must learn to condemn and reject your self to the uttermost and simply take care of the Lords interest of His recovery and not your work
After the Gulf War in 1991, we were ready to afford the Lord a way for His move in Russia, so right away He put His blessing upon us
Thousands of the leading cities in Russia, some with over one million people, have been reached by our publications
Lord, come and fellowship with us, and grant us Your fellowship that we may have the freedom to fellowship with one another
After returning to England, as he was sitting by the seashore looking toward the east, he could not forget China
He declared and proclaimed that the churches established by his missionaries were not denominational; therefore, they did not have a name
That defect initiated the beginning of the so-called national churches, the churches of a nation, especially in Northern Europe
Strictly speaking, whether you are Chinese, American, or German, to be an Episcopalian is to be a British subject
On the one hand, they knew that the recovery had the truth, and they were right according to the truths that the recovery holds
The history among us proves that those who became somewhat capable, possessing a certain 'spiritual capacity,' eventually became a problem
A certain brother who was a traveling Southern Baptist preacher came to every meeting to listen to the messages
There were about five hundred people who came to listen to me, including some leading ones, and they accepted my teaching
After they heard my messages, the leaders of these groups implored me, saying, 'Brother Lee, now we realize the way we should take
Generally speaking, there have been only two or three occasions of rebellion among us, but in actuality, there have been many
You must beware of four things: ambition, pride, self-justification, and the self, the natural man, the disposition
We cannot avoid having so many of us together, especially today as the modern conveniences make the globe small
Such a one who makes himself attractive is wrong already, and if you are attracted to follow him, you help him to be wrong
It means to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly together
One whom we follow should be a person loving the Lord, living for the Lord, and renouncing his self, natural life, preference, and ambition
We know what the right way is, but when the brothers fellowship with you and propose a certain way, you always agree with them'
The first one proposed a way to go, the second one proposed a better way, and the third one proposed yet another way that would save time
The three argued for so long that by the time they finished arguing, they could have been there no matter what way they went
In the church life in the Lord's recovery we all have to learn how to give in, even if it means that we suffer
Your intention may be to protect the recovery from mistakes, but in actuality your insistence on your preference is the biggest mistake
Those dear ones especially who are born with a strong character must be aware of their strong character in insisting on their preference
One whom we follow must hold the complete revelation of the entire holy Scriptures properly without any twisting and deforming
Many Christians today argue with one another, but very few know that in the Bible there is such a thing as the eternal economy of God
The accepting of the divine revelation must also be governed by Christ as the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy
It did not speak of God's economy as a plan but of God's economy in our being concerning our spirit, our mind, our will, and our emotion
The fountain is God the Father, the spring is God the Son, and the river is God the Spirit flowing as living water into eternal life
From Genesis to Revelation the entire Bible speaks only about this flowing Triune God, and the issue of Their flowing is the New Jerusalem
Some said that they belonged to Paul, some to Cephas, some to Apollos, and some, the 'superior' ones, to Christ
A brother from Ghana told us that when he returned to his homeland, he saw the unbelievers there speaking in tongues by the demons
Certain ones put their hands on your head and teach you to turn your tongue and say 'Praise Jesus' very quickly
He was a top writer concerning eternal life, and we may even say that the line of eternal life in Christian writings stopped after his death
In contrast, a certain brother often used to bring his followers to a coffee shop to drink together and speak in an improper way
At most, he once said that a certain brother, who was always in his mind and never in his spirit, may have been 'saved but not regenerated'
Prayer: Lord, in spite of all these defects and mistakes made by us, we are not disheartened, discouraged, or disappointed
Rather, Lord, we are very much encouraged by You, by what You are, by what You have done, and by what You are still doing
Lord, do saturate us and soak us to be everything within us, to be our faith, our joy, our peace, our rest, and our comfort
