[1]  PART ONE THE THREE MAIN MINISTRIES IN GOD S ECONOMY CHAPTER ONE THE PRIESTHOOD
[2]  To define what we mean by the word priesthood, let us read several verses of Scripture.
[3]  Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.
[4]  Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ...But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .
[5]  To Him Who loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever.
[6]  Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years...And there shall no longer be any curse.
[7]  After he was called by God to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt, he was at least in the Holy Place.
[8]  Psalm 23 is familiar to us, but perhaps we have not noticed what is stressed at its end. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever v. 6 . We know that this Psalm starts with the green pastures and continues through the paths of righteousness and the battlefield, until the Psalmist eventually comes to the point where he dwells in the house of the Lord forever.
[9]  In the last chapter, we saw that a priest is the type of person that God planned to have for the fulfillment of His purpose.
[10]  He is not merely a person serving the Lord, but one who is in reality mingled with the Lord to fulfill His purpose.
[11]  Not many Christians talk about the eternal purpose of the Lord, because very few are clear about God s ultimate intention.
[12]  In order to know the real priesthood, we must first know the spiritual, eternal intention of God.
[13]  The Bible shows us that God s intention is to work Himself into us that we and He may be fully one.
[14]  But once we turned to the Lord, we began to exercise our mind to think what we must do for the Lord.
[15]  In the last chapter, we saw that Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were all priests.
[16]  If we read the whole Bible, we will see that these godly persons were priests who fulfilled the purpose of God.
[17]  We have mentioned that the leading ministry in God s economy is the priesthood and that the kingship was brought into function through the priesthood.
[18]  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth Gen 1:26-28 .
[19]  The priesthood in reality needs God s image, which requires transformation.
[20]  We are all priests and kings in position, but we fall short of God s image in reality.
[21]  And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both Zech 6:12-13 .
[22]  The above two verses tell us that Christ is the Branch, and as both Priest and King He shall build the temple of the Lord.
[23]  The prophethood is not as basic a ministry as the priesthood and kingship.
[24]  The book of Hebrews tells us that Christ is a Priest, and the book of Matthew tells us that Christ is a King.
[25]  The real need today is to have the practice of the priesthood with the kingship for the church life.
[26]  This means each brother and sister must be helped to know the inner life and exercise his spirit until he is strengthened within to have the adequate growth in life.
[27]  For every high priest taken from among men is established on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; Who is able to exercise forbearance toward the ignorant and straying, since he also is encompassed with weakness; And because of it he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
[28]  And no one takes the honor to himself, but as he is called by God, even as Aaron also.
[29]  So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest, but He Who said to Him, You are My Son, this day I have begotten You; As also in another place He says, You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec...For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace; Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually Heb 5:1-6; 7:1-3 .
[30]  The order of priests according to Aaron was something of man bringing the needs of man to God, because these priests were chosen from among men.
[31]  A priest must be a person fully mingled with God.
[32]  The human nature must be holy in order to be mingled with the divine nature, which is kingly.
[33]  As long as we have the divine nature, we have the kingship, for anything divine is kingly.
[34]  If we are willing to be utterly separated unto God without any reservation, we will be kingly.
[35]  The more we are separated unto God, the more we are holy and kingly.
[36]  After staying in the presence of the Lord for a certain time as holy, separated priests, we come out from the Lord s presence with something divine.
[37]  We as priests must realize that whenever we go into the presence of the Lord with our needs and the needs of others we are holy priests.
[38]  In the church life we must all be holy priests in our private lives and kingly priests in the meetings.
[39]  Day by day we must be in the presence of the Lord to bring our needs and all the brothers and unbelievers needs to Him.
[40]  Then when we come to the meetings, we will impart something of Christ to the needy ones.
[41]  We must be burdened to cry to the Lord until we see in every locality brothers and sisters functioning as holy priests in the presence of the Lord and as kingly priests unto the people.
[42]  Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.
[43]  All service for the Lord must be priestly, regardless of what kind of service it is.
[44]  The priests in the Old Testament were not only priests, but also the army; so the army was a priestly army.
[45]  Priests not only stand before God, ministering unto Him, but they also fight the battle.
[46]  This means that if we are not priests, we can never fight the battle for the Lord.
[47]  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD: He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
[48]  All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
[49]  Regardless of how much we realize that we are born priests and kings, if we are not willing to separate ourselves unto the Lord, we could never be in the genuine priesthood.
[50]  PART TWO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE PRIESTHOOD CHAPTER EIGHT THE EXPERIENCES OF THE PRIESTS
[51]  What is the relationship between Christ and the priesthood?
[52]  When we say Christ we mean the all-inclusive Christ.
[53]  He is the very embodiment of the Triune God, our Savior, and He is also our life.
[54]  Then when we confessed to the Lord, we realized that Christ on the cross bore all our trespasses before God.
[55]  And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
[56]  When we experience Christ as our inner life supply, we will be able to spread Him before others and God.
[57]  Christ is within us, but we must experience Him as the indwelling One and the hidden One within who is our life supply.
[58]  The priesthood must also burn the incense at the golden altar in the Holy Place.
[59]  If we burn the incense, we must light the lamp, and if we light the lamp, we must burn the incense.
[60]  This shows us that to receive the light from the Word, we must pray by burning the incense; and if we pray by burning the incense, we must light the lamp by reading the Word.
[61]  While we pray, we must read, and while we read, we must pray.
[62]  When we experience Christ as the inner life and inner light, and enjoy Him as the inner life supply, there is a sweet and precious feeling that we are so acceptable and pleasing to God.
[63]  And the LORD said unto Joshua...And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan...And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap Josh 3:6, 7, 8, 13 .
[64]  Not only should we experience Christ as the offerings, the inner life, the inner light, and the inner acceptance, but we must go on to experience Him as the very testimony of God.
[65]  We must continue to examine the relationship between Christ and the priesthood by seeing the living of the priests.
[66]  As far as their living is concerned, the priests need to eat that they might be strengthened, nourished, and filled within, and they need to be clothed that they might be covered without.
[67]  Then let us read Leviticus 7:14, 31-34: And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for a heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings...And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron s and his sons .
[68]  They are not only the ones serving God or interceding for others, but they also take care of the different aspects of Christ, handle Christ, and minister Christ to others.
[69]  They know how to believe in Christ, follow Christ, know Christ, worship Christ, and preach Christ, but they have never heard about enjoying Christ by feeding upon Him.
[70]  Although we cannot cover all the offerings, let us illustrate what the showbread means to us.
[71]  The showbread is one of the foods for the priests, and we have seen that it signifies Christ as our life and life supply.
[72]  To handle Christ as the showbread and to minister Him to others, we must first enjoy and feed on Him as the showbread.
[73]  This means that we must experience Christ as the inner life and the life supply by feeding on Him.
[74]  When we minister Christ to others, we also feed ourselves with Him.
[75]  This means that when we minister Christ as the Savior to a lost person, not only will the person be saved, but we will also be fed with Christ while we are ministering Him in this way.
[76]  Others should see upon us the purity of Christ, the divine nature of Christ, the redemption of Christ, the heavenly nature of Christ, and the kingship, headship, dignity, and authority of Christ.
[77]  Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make them.
[78]  For we know that, if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
[79]  Now let us read Ephesians 4:22-24: That you have put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit; And are renewed in the spirit of your mind, And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[80]  To find what the new man is, we must turn back to Ephesians 2:15-16: Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace, And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it.
[81]  We have seen that the first item of the living of the priests is to feast on Christ.
[82]  This means to take Christ in. Day by day we have at least three meals in which we do nothing but take in food.
[83]  The food we take in is the inner supply, and the clothing we wear is the outer expression of what we have taken in. If we feed on Christ all day, eventually He will be expressed from within us.
[84]  It is very interesting to notice that the garments of the priests are composed of the same materials as the tabernacle.
[85]  If we do not have this expression of Christ, we do not have the church.
[86]  In a sense we may rightly say that we are the church, but the real church life is the expression of Christ.
[87]  When we are filled and saturated with Christ, expressing Him in an accurate and full way, we will become God s dwelling place.
[88]  First Peter 2:5 tells us that when we as living stones are built up as a living, spiritual house, as a holy body of priests, as a priesthood, then we will offer spiritual sacrifices unto God.
[89]  And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony the law which I shall give thee.
[90]  Then let us read Hebrews 9:3-5: And after the second veil, a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, Having a golden altar and the ark of the covenant covered round in every part with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; And above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiation-cover, concerning which we cannot now speak in detail.
[91]  For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God...Christ Jesus: Whom God set forth a propitiation-cover...
[92]  This means that the priests must enjoy Christ, take Christ in, feed on Christ, and be filled with Christ.
[93]  The more we experience and enjoy Christ and are filled and saturated with Him, the more we will have the church life as the expression of Christ.
[94]  In the Holy Place, we enjoy Christ at the showbread table as life and the life supply; we enjoy Him at the lampstand as the light of life; then at the golden altar we enjoy Him as the sweet acceptance to God.
[95]  The law shows us that God is a God of holiness, a God of righteousness, a God of love, and a God of light.
[96]  The content of the church life is Christ, and this Christ is filled with all that God is.
[97]  Upon Him there is the manifestation of God as the glory, continually testifying, watching, and finding our shortages according to the inner testimony.
[98]  I believe we have asked the Lord to forgive us for our hatred, but have we ever asked the Lord to forgive us for our love?
[99]  When we, as members of the church, come to contact the Lord, immediately our consciences sense the watching eyes of the cherubim, checking according to God s glory and condemning us by the testimony the law of God.
[100]  It is a deep and inward Christ, a Christ full of all that God is, and a Christ who is the hidden supply and the resurrection power within us.
[101]  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
[102]  For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations Exo 30:17-21 .
[103]  And we must keep in mind that when we use the word priesthood, it does not only mean the office of the priests, but also the body of priests.
[104]  We must apply the blood to deal with our sin and sins, and we must apply the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit to get rid of all of the earthly touch so that we may be cleansed for the Lord s service.
[105]  By His mercy I am trying to impress you that all these dealings with sin, the world, and the self are vital to the church life.
[106]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN HOW TO ENTER THE HOLY OF HOLIES
[107]  There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
[108]  Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience...For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart...Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help Heb 4:9, 11-12, 16 .
[109]  Now we must read Revelation 5:8-10: And when He Christ the Lamb took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
[110]  And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, And made them to our God a kingdom and priests, and they shall reign on the earth.
[111]  But by what way can we be in the spirit?
[112]  It is only when we are in the spirit that we are in the priesthood.
[113]  Revelation 5:8 tells us that the prayers of the saints are the bowls which contain the incense of Christ.
[114]  In our prayers, which are the bowls, are the various precious aspects of Christ, which are like the incense.
[115]  To be priests we must offer prayers, and when we do, something of Christ will be added to our prayers.
[116]  As long as we are in the spirit, we are in the priesthood, and as long as we are in the priesthood, we have the enjoyment of Christ and are in the building up of the Body.
[117]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE WHOLE VISION OF THE SCRIPTURES COVERED BY THE PRIESTHOOD
[118]  Genesis 1:26 says, And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
[119]  If we put all these words together by the inspiration and anointing of the Spirit, we will see that though man was created in the image of God and committed with the divine authority, he still needs the life of God, that by the flow of this life he will be transformed into gold, pearl, and the onyx stone.
[120]  The priesthood is a group of people who realize that God s intention is to mingle Himself with them.
[121]  It is not to pray in a way of asking the Lord to do something for us, but to pray to be filled with the Lord, to be opened to the Lord, and to let the Lord saturate us and fully possess us.
[122]  This vision is that God must work Himself into us that in His life we will be transformed into His image to exercise His authority.
[123]  I would suggest three things for us to do.
[124]  First, in our private daily lives we must learn to turn ourselves to the Lord in prayer.
[125]  Even when we do not have the time to pray, we still must exercise our spirit a little to contact the Lord.
[126]  If we all will practice these three things individual prayer in our daily life, corporate prayer with a few others, and functioning in the church meetings by releasing our spirit to utter something to the Lord and to others then we will all be so simple, yet so rich in life, strong in the spirit, aggressive in our function, and fruitful in our service.
[127]  And thou shalt put it the incense altar before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony...where I will meet with thee Exo 30:6 .
[128]  Now we must read Leviticus 4:7: And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
[129]  And it came to pass, that, while he Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist executed the priest s office before God in the order of his course, according to the custom of the priest s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
[130]  As we have seen, priests are those who open themselves unto the Lord, who go into the presence of the Lord, and who contact Him and fellowship with Him until He fills and saturates them to make them one with Him.
[131]  They always enjoy Christ as their food and as their nourishment.
[132]  The first place for it to be sprinkled is the incense altar, because when we commune and fellowship with God we must do so through the redeeming blood.
[133]  Furthermore, on the brazen altar the heavenly fire burned all the offerings.
[134]  The fire came down from heaven, representing and signifying God Himself as the consuming fire.
[135]  It is this same fire which consumes the offerings on the brass altar that must burn the incense on the incense altar.
[136]  When we pray to God, we must apply Christ as our sin offering, as our trespass offering, and as so many other offerings.
[137]  Then we must feed on Christ to enjoy Him and take Him in. It is by this Christ with His redeeming blood that we can go into the presence of God.
[138]  The proper way to pray is to apply Christ as all the offerings, to feed upon and take in Christ as our full nourishment, and then to utter something of Christ from deep within.
[139]  We have to go to the Lord, applying Christ as the different offerings, enjoying Christ as our full nourishment, and then uttering something of Christ from within as a sweet smelling savor which ascends to God.
[140]  The blood shed on the outer altar must be brought into the tabernacle to be put on the inner altar.
[141]  It means, first of all, that before we spend time in the presence of God to burn the incense, we must always apply the blood.
[142]  Sometimes we may sense that we are so much on fire for the Lord, but if we check ourselves, we see that we are not on heavenly fire, but on strange fire.
[143]  If we would come together with some brothers or sisters every day for half an hour to an hour s time to apply Christ, enjoy Christ, and express Christ corporately in our prayer to God, it would help the building up of the church very much.
[144]  And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.
[145]  In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel Exo 27:20-21 .
[146]  If we are going to pray, we must pray upon the redemption of Christ.
[147]  When we are filled with Christ as our enjoyment, we offer the very Christ who is our satisfaction and enjoyment to God as His satisfaction and enjoyment.
[148]  Christ at the offering altar is our offering, and the same Christ at the incense altar is God s incense.
[149]  If the sisters want to pray about their husbands, they must first read the Word.
[150]  It is by these, the blood and the incense, that we are accepted by God, and it is also by these that we contact, meet, and have fellowship with God.
[151]  However, according to the record of the Old Testament, there are at least two other things in the Holy Place: the showbread table and the lampstand.
[152]  What kind of relationship do these have with our contacting God?
[153]  In the last chapter we saw clearly that if we burn the incense, we cannot burn it in darkness.
[154]  It is in this enlightenment that we know how to pray and how to utter something of Christ unto God as the sweet incense.
[155]  Then by, in, and with this light we will be able to offer the incense; that is, we will be able to pray with Christ as incense, in a proper way, in the light.
[156]  But if we are going to have the proper prayer that is acceptable to God, the sweet incense with something of Christ in it, we cannot begin to pray immediately.
[157]  This is not a kind of teaching, but a certain kind of instruction to show you the proper way to contact God and to enjoy and experience all the riches of Christ in the presence of God.
[158]  If we would just confess all our sins, our failures, our mistakes, our wrong deeds, our shortcomings, and our weak points, and apply the redeeming blood of Christ to cleanse us, immediately we would have the sense within that this redeeming Christ has become our inner enjoyment and nourishment.
[159]  When we assimilate Christ into our being we have something so sweet and precious of Christ to utter to God.
[160]  When we get up early in the morning, we must stay at the offering altar for some time, realizing that we are sinful.
[161]  At the altar we confess so many items in which we are wrong: our attitudes, our motives, our intentions, our way of thinking, our way of making decisions, the way we love things, the way we hate things, etc. We are full of dirt, so we must confess to the Lord.
[162]  The priestly office is quite involved with the whole situation of the tabernacle.
[163]  Because God is on the mercy seat, which is the cover of the ark, and His shekinah glory is in the Holy of Holies, a priest must get to the mercy seat to contact God.
[164]  When we get into the enjoyment of Christ, we are in the divine dispensing of God Himself in Christ through the Spirit as life to us.
[165]  In the presence of God, the priest wears the breastplate.
[166]  Regardless of how spiritual we are, and how much we have been changed in nature, if we are just by ourselves, we are not the light and we do not have the light.
[167]  Regardless of how completely we are redeemed, how richly we have been nourished with the life, how thoroughly we have been enlightened with the light, and how absolutely we are transformed into pieces of precious stones, without Christ added we are still in darkness and we do not have the perfection.
[168]  Christ is the offering, Christ is the bread of life, Christ is the light, and Christ is the incense.
[169]  Several years ago I read an article concerning the Urim and Thummim written by an authority on Judaism.
[170]  But it does not give light until the high priest presents the redeeming blood and, by means of the acceptable incense, goes into the presence of God to ask Him something related to His people.
[171]  All the Epistles written by the Apostles were written in this way.
