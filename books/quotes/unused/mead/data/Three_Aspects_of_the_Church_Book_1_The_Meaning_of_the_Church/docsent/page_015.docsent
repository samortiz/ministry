   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Recovering the Oneness by Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The oneness in God s creation is according to His power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By His power God caused all things to function in a normal relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of their relationship and function toward God under the power of His creation, all things were in harmony and the universe was one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then Satan rebelled and brought death into the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once rebellion and death entered all things, the oneness was lost, and all things entered into a state of discord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today people disobey God, and those who are in lower positions disobey and even oppose those who are above them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although God upholds all things by His power, the oneness has been broken; therefore, God must come in to recover the oneness by His life, not by His power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God begins this work of recovery in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By His life He is recovering oneness in the church, and He will eventually recover oneness among all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Formerly, we were dead in offenses and sins, alienated from the life of God, and were enemies of God, but God s mercy reached us Eph 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through the redemption of the cross and through our believing, God forgave us of our sins and imparted His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once God s life entered into us, we were joined to Him, not only recovering our relationship with God as our Creator but also entering into union with Him in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, our function toward God, for which we were created, has been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This function enables us to rule for God, to accomplish God s purpose, to fulfill God s will, and to live out God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The corruption that was brought in through death is altogether swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is now complete harmony and one accord in our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the oneness God desires to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our experience, whether or not we arrive at the oneness that God desires, depends upon our arriving at the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 4:13 says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For us to arrive at the oneness is for us to arrive at the full-grown Christ and to allow the fullness of Christ to be manifested among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we are short of Christ, we are short of the oneness, and whenever we lack the element of Christ, we are in disharmony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life brings in light; and light, which is the knowledge of the Son of God, issues in harmony and oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today is not the time for God to deal with all things; rather, now is the time for God to deal with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God must deal with the church; otherwise, there will be no way for all things to become one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s dealing begins with the church as the firstfruits among all things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to carry out His complete work of restoration, He must first carry out His work of recovering the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the work of recovery, and it is carried out by God s life, not by God s methods, power, or acts; it is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The condition of oneness expressed through the church, depends upon the degree to which the church possesses God s life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oneness does not come from talking but from growth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not allow God s life to grow in us, no matter how much we desire to be one with the brothers and sisters, we will not be able to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only way to recover the oneness of the church is by life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This oneness is in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our fellowship is not based on having the same mind or sharing the same view; rather, it is altogether based on life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fellowship is life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan brought death into all things, causing all things to be separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, God has come into us as life, causing us to be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we touch life, we enter into God more deeply and are one with those in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, when life comes in, it brings in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Oneness is simply life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where there is life, there is oneness, and where there is oneness, there is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When life comes, the Head also comes; when the Head comes, oneness comes as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not have much experience of being in life, we will not have much experience of being under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All things not under the Head are in discord and death.</S>
