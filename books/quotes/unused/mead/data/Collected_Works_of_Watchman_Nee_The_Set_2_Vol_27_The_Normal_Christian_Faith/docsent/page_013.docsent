   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUALIFICATIONS FOR A MAN TO BE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is a thorny task.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we will employ the effective method we have adopted namely, setting down a few principles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we will search according to these qualifications and directions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We want to base our evaluation on what manner of life a person should possess and what qualifications he must have if he is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first condition that this person must fulfill is that he must claim to be God while he is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He cannot be apologetic about it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He must declare boldly that he is God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only then can we know who he is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without this declaration, we have no way to guess his identity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, a declaration is our first qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, the way this person came into the world must be different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I said that I am God and yet was born in the same manner as every other mortal, my words would carry no force.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If on the other hand, I dropped down from heaven, my assertion would be taken seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way this person comes into being must be extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He must come in an absolutely different fashion; otherwise, his words will not carry the necessary weight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, this man must bear a moral standard that is far above that of all other human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He must have God's holiness, and his life must bear the mark of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, if I became a bird and lived in exactly the same way as other birds, without showing them anything extraordinary, I could not convince them that I was actually a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God is to become a man, His moral behavior must be of the highest quality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the only way that we could identify Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, if a person is God, he must necessarily be able to perform things which no mortal can do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he can achieve what we cannot achieve and know what we do not know, we can say that he is truly God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lastly, this person must be able to tell us the divine purpose concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What was God's purpose in creating the universe and man?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How does He take care of human pains and sorrows?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the origin and ultimate solution of everything in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What should our attitude towards God be?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these he must reveal to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unless this one shows us what we do not see, we cannot say that he has shown us any revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A MAN WHO MEETS ALL FIVE CONDITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will set down these five conditions and put the whole of humanity to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us find out if someone meets the five requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a person would surely be qualified to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first person to put to the test should be yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, you are not God, because you have never claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nor have I ever claimed to be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So that rules out you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Very well, now we will introduce Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you read his books, you will find that he did conduct a very moral and proper life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he never claimed to be God either.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, he fails in the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What about Sakya Muni, the founder of Buddhism?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only was there an absence of the claim of divinity, but his philosophy itself is void of deity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not believe in the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since he had no God, he cannot be God either.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Next, go to Mohammed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But he never claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He called God Allah and himself the prophet of Allah.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you go through every person in history, you will discover that no one ever claimed to be God except One.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That One was Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He claimed to be the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No other person put forward such a claim.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE CLAIM TO BE GOD A SERIOUS MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can Jesus of Nazareth claim to be God?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before going on, we have to pause for a moment to seriously consider the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not a light thing to claim to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A person who makes such a claim falls into one of three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He must belong to one of these three categories; he cannot belong to all three.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, if he claims to be God and yet in fact is not, he has to be a madman or a lunatic.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Second, if he is neither God nor a lunatic, he has to be a liar, deceiving others by his lie.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Third, if he is neither of these, he must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You can only choose one of the three possibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you do not believe that he is God, you have to consider him a madman.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you cannot take him for either of the two, you have to take him for a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no need for us to prove if Jesus of Nazareth is God or not.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All we have to do is find out if He is a lunatic or a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If He is neither, He must be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These are our three choices.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>THE SON AND THE FATHER ARE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What did Jesus of Nazareth say about Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In John 10:30 He said, "I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need some explanation here.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Bible the invisible God is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Son manifests and expresses the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What is hidden is the Father, and what is expressed is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Son is the One who can be seen and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Behind, you have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In front, you have the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The two are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They are the two sides of the same reality.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we talk about two, we refer to the fact that one is hidden while the other is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we talk about one, we say that the revealed One is just the hidden One in manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the biblical interpretation of the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, when Jesus of Nazareth one day said, "I and the Father are one," it was a statement that no one else could make.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This man was saying in reality that He and the invisible God are one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is God and God is He.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God is the invisible Father, and He is the manifested Son.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Father and the Son are one!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Who can this One be that made such a claim?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Is He a madman?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Is He out to deceive us?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After Jesus spoke such a word, what reaction do we see?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>"The Jews again took up stones that they might stone Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Jews understood very well that Jesus' words meant that He claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After hearing these words they wanted to stone Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>A claim was made by Jesus, and an accusation was charged by the Jews, both of which concerned His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Was Jesus insane?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Did He speak pure nonsense just to cause people to kill Him?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Or was He a swindler setting up some kind of a scheme?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If so, what was He trying to gain?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Was He trying to gain death?</S>
