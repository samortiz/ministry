   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AS A COVENANT FOR THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND A LIGHT FOR THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 42 reveals Christ as a covenant for the people and a light for the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is a covenant, and this covenant is a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A covenant denotes an agreement between two parties, a contract signed by both parties.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A testament is a covenant, a signed agreement, that has become a will in which certain things are passed on to the heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The covenant is the agreement between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the death of Christ, the covenant became a testament, a will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now in His resurrection Christ executes, enforces, this testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the book of Isaiah, the covenant, which has become the testament, is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we first have the covenant, the covenant becomes the testament, and the testament is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ has not only given us the testament He Himself is the testament and the reality of everything contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, two items in the testament are life and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, Christ is our eternal life, and He is our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. Called by Jehovah,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Held by His Hand, and Kept by Him</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ has been called by Jehovah, and He is held by His hand and kept by Him 42:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that Christ and the God who calls are one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, Christ has been called by Jehovah, and then Christ is held and kept by Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, Christ and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This Christ has been called to be a covenant for the people 49:8b; Heb 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ has also been called to be a light for the nations Isa 49:6b; Matt 4:13-16 , to open the eyes of the blind Isa 42:7a; Luke 4:18; John 9:14 , and to bring the prisoner out of prison and those who dwell in darkness from the prison house Isa 42:7b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. The Servant of Jehovah,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whom Jehovah Upholds,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jehovah's Chosen One,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>in Whom Jehovah's Soul Delights</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah 42:1 says, "Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold, / My chosen One in whom My soul delights; / I have put My Spirit upon Him, / And He will bring forth judgment to the nations" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matt 12:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For Jehovah's Spirit to be upon His Servant means that His Spirit and His Servant are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word judgment in 42:1 is significant; it is an inclusive term.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have the Lord, we have judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the Lord, we do not have any judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we have the Lord, everything is judged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ must be the judgment for everything in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, we should have the Lord's judgment concerning the kind of shoes we buy and the way we style our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ's being the judgment means that Christ is the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to have Him as our judgment, we must have Him as our answer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without Christ, we have only questions; with Christ, we have an answer for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To wait on Christ means that we bring every question to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before doing a certain thing, we should bring that matter to the Lord and wait for His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must learn the lesson not to do anything or say anything before waiting on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we turn to the Lord and wait on Him, judgment comes, and we are able to act and speak in oneness with the Lord.</S>
