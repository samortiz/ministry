We are the sons of God, enjoying His life. We are the wife of Christ, receiving His love. We are kings over the nations, reigning forever.<p>I trust we have a clear view of what there will be in eternity. In it all, Christ will still minister His supply to us.<h2 class=head1>A PROMISE AND A CALL</h2><p>In the last chapter we have a promise and a call.<p>&#8220;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city&#8221; (22:14). Here is a promise that those who wash their robes in the blood will enjoy the tree of life. Then in verse 17 there is a call. &#8220;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! Let him who hears also say, Come! Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely.&#8221; Whoever answers the call and comes, will drink of the water of life. Those who respond to this call, which is still going out, will also receive the promise. They will enjoy Christ as the tree of life and drink of Him as the life-giving Spirit. These two verses are profound, though very brief.<h2 class=head1>NEW JERUSALEM AND ITS FORETASTE TODAY</h2><p>We have a clear picture here of what there will be in eternity. Our enjoyment will be the very Triune God-the Father, the Son as the Lamb, and the Spirit. Out of the throne of this Triune God flows the river of water of life. In this water grows the tree of life for the life supply. We shall be there as the city to be God&#8217;s dwelling place. God will be there as our dwelling place. He will dwell in us, and we shall dwell in Him. We shall be mingled together as a wonderful though indescribable unit! Christ will still be the center, ministering eternally to keep the whole city supplied.<p>In this age the church life is a miniature of the New Jerusalem. We are God&#8217;s dwelling place, and we take Him as our abode; that is, He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him. We have the throne of God and of the Lamb. We enjoy a river flowing and the tree of life growing. The church is also full of light. The Spirit speaks along with the church, the bride. New Jerusalem will be the full consummation of the church life. The foretaste we enjoy now has the very taste we shall know in full in the New Jerusalem. As we are enjoying the church life, we have the sense that we are truly enjoying the Triune God according to the view of the New Jerusalem.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
