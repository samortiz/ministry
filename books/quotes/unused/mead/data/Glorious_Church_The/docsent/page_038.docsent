   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the end of chapter eleven, John saw another vision a vision of the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Within the temple the ark of the covenant could be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God originally told the Israelites to build the ark according to the pattern which was given on the mount and to put the ark into the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, when Solomon built the temple, the ark was put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Israel was taken captive to Babylon, the ark was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But even though the ark on earth was lost, the ark in heaven still remained.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ark on earth was made according to the ark in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The shadow on earth disappeared, but the substance, the reality, in heaven still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the end of Revelation 11, God once again shows us the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the ark?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ark is the expression of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It signifies that God must be faithful to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The throne is the place where God exercises authority, and the temple is the place where God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The throne is something outward toward the world and mankind, but the temple is something for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The rainbow around the throne signifies that God will not do anything harmful to man, while the ark in the temple signifies that God will not do anything that comes short of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What God has purposed, He must accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What God desires to do, He is able to successfully perform.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ark was not only for man, but also for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God cannot deny Himself; He cannot contradict Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God purposed in eternity to have a glorified people, and He determined that the kingdom of this world would become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we see the situation of the church today, we cannot help but ask, "How can God accomplish His purpose?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet we know that God will never stop halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has the ark, and He Himself has made the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The righteous God cannot be unrighteous with man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the righteous God can never be unrighteous to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man never does anything to contradict himself, for each man has his own character.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither can God deny Himself in His work because of His own character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God unveiled the ark to us, He meant that what He desires to do He must accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we must see one point.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the basis upon which God and His Christ will reign forever and ever?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the basis upon which God will cause the kingdom of this world to become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His character is the basis.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God will accomplish all of these things because of His own character.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nothing can hinder Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn that whatever is of God can never be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ark still remains, representing God Himself and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God will accomplish this matter by means of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We thank God that from chapter twelve to the end of the book we are shown how God will accomplish all that He purposed in eternity through His own faithfulness.</S>
