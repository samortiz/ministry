   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Receiving the Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should also have an attitude of coming to receive the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should never come to the Bible to seek knowledge or study facts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This can be compared to studying the rice, meat, and vegetables on the table instead of eating them so that we can be nourished and supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is a treasure store of the spiritual bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we should always have the attitude of taking the bread of life from this treasure store for our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not merely a matter of understanding or comprehending with our mind; it is a matter of receiving the life supply from the Bible with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This point must be emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not say in our heart, I come to the Bible in order to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The proper attitude is to regard the Bible as a treasure store of the bread of life from which we draw the bread of life and are supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We read the Bible in order to obtain the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Receiving Enlightenment</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should also have an attitude of coming to receive enlightenment and not to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To study the truth is one attitude, and to receive enlightenment is another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In studying the truth we need only our mind, but to receive enlightenment, we need our heart and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to come before God and say, I want to touch the light in Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My heart and my spirit are open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, enlighten me through Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As I read, grant me not only the understanding, but even more, shine Your light through Your Spirit on the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Enlighten me concerning Your heart s desire and expose my true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not want merely to comprehend, but even more I want to see.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want enlightenment and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should also learn to pray when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should spontaneously have a prayer deep within us, saying, Lord, I come to Your Word to contact You, not merely to read.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Cause my heart to incline toward You and my spirit to open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cause me to love You more than knowledge and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May my inner being be nourished and enlightened by Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should have this kind of prayer, intention, and attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who read the Bible must realize what the Word of God is and have a proper attitude toward the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many do not read the Bible properly because they lack this preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are well prepared with regard to these two points, it will be much easier for us to read the Bible in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will immediately be on the proper path to touch life, to come to the light, and to fellowship with God in life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, we will contact God, and in Him and through His Word, receive the life supply and the revelation in light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only then can we gain the real benefit from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not a matter of knowledge or a matter of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person who obtains nourishment and receives revelation will spontaneously have understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the nourishment and revelation he receives is above and beyond understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must have such an attitude in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE WAYS TO READ THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have been studying different ways to read the Bible for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have even published books such as How to Study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But what we would speak of today is the simplest and most practical way to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are many ways to read the Bible that either require too much time or are too demanding for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should give new believers a simple way to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible can be read when one is at work or at school.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if a person is very busy, it is still possible to read a short portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a very convenient way of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Reading Sequentially</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, we should read the books of the Bible sequentially.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some new believers read the Bible randomly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When they rise in the morning, they shut their eyes and open to any page in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they happen to open to the book of Psalms, they read a psalm, and if they open to the book of Revelation, they read Revelation; they simply read whatever page they open to.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the page they open to contains a difficult portion, they may avoid it and go to another page.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If they come to an easy portion, they may read for a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible must be read consecutively and not randomly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Having a responsibility before God, believers should not randomly approach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to read the easy portions as well as the difficult ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even if we do not understand a portion in the Bible, we still need to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, we should always read in sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, we should even read all the names in the genealogy in Matthew 1:1-17.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should read the Old Testament and the New Testament simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not wait until we finish reading the Old Testament before reading the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should read the Old Testament consecutively beginning with the book of Genesis and at the same time read the New Testament consecutively beginning with the book of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every Christian should allocate two different times to daily read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One time should be in the morning, and the other can also be in the morning or in the afternoon or evening.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>According to the experience of many Christians, it is best to read the New Testament in the morning and the Old Testament during the other time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should read a consecutive portion during both times.</S>
