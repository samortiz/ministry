   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Reality of the Filling Being within Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Accompanying Us Day by Day</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is also the same with the matter of being filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The resurrected Christ as the reality of the filling of the Holy Spirit is within us, accompanying us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s word says clearly, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord accompanies us all the way; He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now you simply need to say, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fill me!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You will be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the secret of being filled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should never consider that being filled with the Holy Spirit is a very difficult matter, and that only those who have been saved over sixty years like me can have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let me tell you that even if you were saved today, you can be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every one of you can be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have been breathing for over eighty years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A newborn babe also breathes, and his breathing is the same as my breathing, with no difference at all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Obtaining Salvation by Confessing with the Mouth and Believing in the Heart</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 10:9 says, That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word indicates that once a person has heard the gospel, he has in his mouth and in his heart the Savior who can save him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He only needs to confess Him as Lord with his mouth, that is, to open his mouth and call on His name, and he shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 10 follows, saying, For with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth man confesses unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To confess with the mouth is to call on the Lord and also speak the Lord Jesus to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, once a person is saved, you will need to lead him to speak the Lord Jesus to others, to speak to the parents, the wife, the husband, the children, and the neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more he speaks, the more he breathes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we go to the communities to help people to be saved, we must set up home meetings in their homes so that they will not only call on the Lord s name, but also speak the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Enjoying the Lord s Riches</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>by Calling on His Name</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 11 and 12 continue, For the Scripture says, All who believe on Him shall not be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The secret of our enjoyment of all the riches of Christ is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is to call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Calling on the Lord is really the secret of our enjoyment of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, for our salvation we need to call on Him; after salvation, daily, even hourly, we need to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some will tell you that to be filled with the Holy Spirit, you need to fast, to confess, to empty yourself, to be broken, and also to pay the price to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you hear this word, you may exercise much effort to fast and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, you may obtain the filling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But actually, being filled with the Holy Spirit is not obtained by the act of fasting and praying; rather, it is obtained by the calling during the fasting and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God as Our Life Having Become a Law</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans chapter eight shows us that God coming into us to be our life is such a normal matter that it has become a law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law of the Spirit of life has freed us and delivered us v. 2 . Every day we are breathing unceasingly; this is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The matter of God in us as our life is also a law; it is a very spontaneous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, when the law of life is operating in us, we need to cooperate with it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, verse 6 says, For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we set our mind on the spirit to cooperate with the law of the Spirit of life, the issue is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The following verses from verse 9 to verse 11 mention God, Christ, and the Spirit at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These three are one; this is simply the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is within us; God is within us; and the Spirit is also within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is sufficient that we obey Him and cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the way to be filled with the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
