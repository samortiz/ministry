Not only should we consecrate people, careers, and things, but we also have to consecrate ourselves. Some think that after one has overcome he does not need to practice obedience anymore. Actually, our overcoming only makes us more able to obey the Lord. Formerly we did not have the strength to obey the Lord. Now that the Lord has accomplished everything for us, we can spontaneously hand over our will and everything to the Lord and allow the Lord to strengthen us with the overcoming life for obedience. This is something that we have to do in a definite way. There must be a definite date to our consecration, in the same way that there is a definite date to a girl's marriage. A girl cannot say, "I think I was married on a certain date." In the same way, we cannot say, "I think I consecrated myself on a certain date." This is something that we need to do before the Lord in a definite way. We should be very clear about this date and never forget it. I consecrated myself to the Lord on February 13, 1922. We can announce our date to others. We can tell those who brought us to the Lord or those who have given us spiritual help. We can even put out an announcement and declare to men as well as to Satan: "I am married to the Lord." Paul said that he had betrothed the Corinthian believers as chaste virgins to the Lord (2 Cor. 11:2).</p><p>Deuteronomy 26:16-19 says that if we obey the Lord's word, the Lord will make us keep all His commandments and make us a holy people to Jehovah our God. Obedience to the Lord's word is our duty as Christians, while making us a holy people to Jehovah is God's duty. If we take care of our part, God will do His part.</p><h2 class="head1">OVERCOMING TO LIVE A CONSECRATED LIFE</h2><p>If consecration is so intimately linked to overcoming, what then is the overcoming life? Is it merely a victory over all the evil things? No! If it were, there would be many people in this world who would not need the overcoming life. They have many natural virtues. They do not lose their temper and do not do many evil things. Are these people victorious? No! Victory does not mean just overcoming evil deeds. Victory means that we no longer live for ourselves but that we live for the Lord while we live on earth every day. We must have the realization that the Lord has purchased us, that we belong to Him, and that we have been married to Him. Those who live in this atmosphere will breathe the heavenly air of holiness.</p><p>Victory is not a practice of negating things. It is not just a passive deliverance from sin. Victory is an active consecration to the Lord and a fellowship with Him while living on this earth. Unless one reaches this stage, he is not overcoming. A Christian first overcomes and then consecrates. If we have broken through in the matter of overcoming, all we have to do today is to consecrate ourselves.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S HEART BEING GOOD</h2><p>Romans 6:16 says, "Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, his slaves you are whom you obey, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness?" We consecrate to the Lord to be His slaves. When many people hear about consecration and being slaves unto God, they are afraid. They think that after they consecrate themselves, God will give them a hard time. However, only those who do not know God think in this way.</p><p>A certain mother did not understand the meaning of obedience and consecration. Someone explained this to her by way of an illustration: "Suppose you have a son who was very stubborn and disobedient. Later, he repented and told you that from then on he would obey you, that he would take your word, and that he would do whatever you wanted him to do. As a mother would you think of difficult things for him to do throughout the whole night so that you could give him a hard time the next day?" The mother said, "Of course not. I would just turn around and love him more." In fact, she would think of how she could make him new clothes or buy him candy. This is a mother's heart. This is also our God's heart.</p><p>When we consecrate ourselves to God, He will order everything and make it work together for us. Is He not satisfied and pleased with our obedience? Why should He be scheming to deal with us or to give us a hard time? God's heart towards us is nothing but goodness and kindness. It is true that He does not do everything according to our way, but we have to believe that His heart towards us is good and kind. Although a Christian may suffer tribulations in this world, he can still rejoice in his heart. We can have joy in the midst of our tears because we know that everything that comes upon us has been measured by the Lord's hand. We have to believe that the Father's intention is always good. The more we consecrate ourselves, the more the Lord will love us. Before we consecrate to the Lord, we are just one among many Christians. But after we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we become totally different persons. We are special in His eyes, and He can have the full freedom to work on us according to His good will.</p><p>May every one of us place everything on the altar&mdash;the people who are related to us, our careers, our possessions, and even ourselves&mdash;sanctifying all these things to the Lord. May we understand that the goal of His salvation is for us to no longer live unto ourselves but to the Lord who died and has been raised for us (2 Cor. 5:14-15).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
