   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A UNIQUE PERSONALITY THE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We find this fact plainly stated in John 1:14, also in Philippians 2:5-7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This uniting of two planes of life in one personality would present to the world a unique Being "The God-Man."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this point the teacher should call attention to the first word in the Bible in reference to this unique personality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Have the class read Genesis 3:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Explain that the Lord God is pronouncing a curse upon the literal serpent in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This reptile had been the tool of Satan and was to experience changed conditions; its degradation doubtless being intended by God to serve as an object lesson to the end of time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Other animals are to return to their original condition in the glorious Millennial Age, but the serpent will continue to glide on its sinuous way in the dust, although its venom will have been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>See Isa 65:25; 11:6-8.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 15 the Lord God is speaking to the being who had used the serpent as his mouthpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This being we have already found to be Satan who had tempted Adam and Eve to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Notice very carefully the words that are uttered, for this verse contains the germ of all Redemptive revelation: "Enmity will I put between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; He shall crush thy head but thou shall crush his heel" Rotherham translation .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we read and re-read, we perceive that the personal pronoun "He" is the emphatic word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Evidently a unique, strong personality is indicated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This personality is said to be the "seed of the woman," an unusual expression considered biologically; for when natural generation is mentioned, the expression "seed of man" is used.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that no human father is indicated and that this seed is to "crush" the head of Satan, would argue that He was to be a super-man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We see also that the crushing of the head of Satan would be to his ambitious power and rule what the crushing of the head of a little serpent would be a death blow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And we see also that the crushing of the heel of the strong one, in the act of crushing the head of the serpent, would mean that all of the venomous power of the serpent would be directed against the heel, causing untold suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us now see if we can find other passages corroborating this peculiar expression, "the seed of the woman."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Isaiah 7:14 we read these words: "Behold a the in the original virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This name is very suggestive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It implies the uniting of two planes of life: the Uncreated Life of God and the created life of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word Immanuel means "God with us."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The us refers to humanity, and the force of the expression is God in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Isaiah 9:6 we find "us" again used.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Unto us i.e., humanity a child is born"; but notice carefully the next phrase "A son is given," not born; implying that His origin is above the plane of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And notice the name given Him: "The Wonderful Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Could any child of human origin bear such a name?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Micah 5:2 we find where this God-Man is to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In reading this passage call attention to the last phrase: "Whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting," and compare with the last phrase of Psalm 90:2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now let us turn to Matthew 1:18-25 where we find the birth of Immanuel, in Bethlehem, recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Also read the beautiful account of His birth as recorded by Luke, the physician.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>See Luke 2:1-20.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No wonder that the angels shouted for joy, for God had clothed Himself with humanity, that He might redeem a sinful human race.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A fourth cardboard symbol should now be shown.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is of uniform size with those already used and contains a large gilt star placed over three circles like those on card 3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A metal fastener is attached to the star and is inserted in the card.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Above the star should be placed the words The God-Man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Underneath the star in smaller letters may be printed, "The Last Adam."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>See Fig.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Explain the latter expression by calling attention to 1 Corinthians 15:45, 47; also link this expression with His human name Jesus, meaning Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>See Matt 1:21.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Point to the white circles as symbolizing His humanity, and make clear to the class that He really partook of our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have Hebrews 2:14-18 read, also Hebrews 4:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Dwell upon the fact that He needed food for the sustenance of His human body and sleep for its refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Call attention to various passages in the Gospels that prove these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Point to the star as symbolizing His Deity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Draw out from the class the proofs of His Deity as found in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let those passages be read which mention His forgiving sins and receiving worship; but be careful not to include those acts of His which were performed as man, exercising faith in God and in utter dependence upon Him; such as fasting in the wilderness, walking upon the water, and passing through the angry mob in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These, and other of His recorded acts, also prove the exercise of that dominion originally given to man which the first Adam forfeited through sin, but which the Last Adam completely manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Also have those passages read which emphasize His dependence upon God, His Father; e.g., John 6:38; 7:16, 28-29; 8:28-29, 38, 49-50; 5:30.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It will be very helpful if the contrast between the temptation scene in the Garden of Eden and that in the wilderness is shown.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A whole lesson might well be devoted to this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Notice that the Last Adam has the same tempter that overcame the First Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The same masterful mind that carefully planned the temptation in the beautiful garden has prepared his snare to entrap and overcome the Last Adam in the wilderness; but notice that where our first parents questioned and disobeyed God's Word, the Last Adam reiterated, "It is written," and remained firm in obedience and humble in dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The First Adam lost his God-given dominion when he sinned, and became the slave of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Last Adam exercised dominion and went up from the wilderness a king.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Right here explain to the class the meaning of dominion as used in this connection, for the subject is little understood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>True dominion has for its object the highest welfare of those dominated, and has power to effect the realization of the same, choosing to do this at any cost to self.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Dominion is the exact opposite of domineering, which has for its object the realization of selfish ambition at the expense of those controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God created man to be the ruler of the earth; he was to be the representative of God and a king here below.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All things were to be subject to him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The idea of kingship is that it is not an authority entrusted to man by man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not come from below.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is a power and sovereignty given by the supreme Lord of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Adolph Saphir</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Call attention to the fact that Satan forfeited his dominion when he sinned, and that he entered upon his domineering career, not as a king over his subjects, but rather as a master over his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even an archangel is but a vassal, not an independent king, and if he does not rule aright the kingdom which has been entrusted to him, it will be given to another.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Pastor Stockmayer</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It will now readily be seen that the humanity of the God-Man is sinless, dependent and victorious; therefore He is ready to execute that Plan for the Redemption of the human race which was in the mind of God even before He created the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In proof of this statement we have but to remember the omniscience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With God it is always present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He has no past, no future.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He saw the result of man's sin before He created him and assumed the responsibility incurred in creating a being with the power of choice.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He discharged that responsibility by providing a way whereby man might use his power of choice in such a manner that he could be freed from sin and become His glorified son.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus God's Plan of Redemption antedates the sin of man that made it necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>WHAT THE REDEEMER MUST DO</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let us now carefully note what the Redeemer must do in executing this Plan.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>First: He must become identified with the human race in its sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This means a deeper humbling.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We see this indicated in Philippians 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the previous verse we read, "He emptied Himself" to be "made in the likeness of man"; but now we read, "being found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Second: Identified with sinners, He must vicariously and representatively come under the operation of the law of sin and death in a substitutionary manner, that He might experience the full penalty for sin i.e., death, or separation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Third: Having representatively and substitutionally experienced the penalty, He must representatively manifest the working of a higher law, even the law of the Spirit of Life the Life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Fourth: As the glorified God-Man, He must become the Head of a new order of redeemed human beings, who should share His Life and eventually become conformed to His Image and be found in His Likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All this, the God-Man Jesus Christ was ready to do; for He had said, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God."</S>
