   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some have thought that being free from the denominations is the same as being free from authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, freedom from the denominations only frees us from man's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are still under the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our daily lives and work, God has appointed many representative authorities for us to learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a man says that he cannot find any authority to submit to, something must be wrong with such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a family gathers together we surely find all kinds of authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The parents are the authority to children, grandparents are the authority to parents, and older brothers and sisters are the authority to younger brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are at home, we have to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are away from home, the policemen on the streets are our authority, and we have to submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot overturn their authority just because we do not feel like submitting to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a responsible brother of an assembly wants to know if he should be a responsible one, the best way is for him to ask others whether they feel he should be a responsible one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The other brothers need not be political.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a responsible brother is doing a good job, he can go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, he should resign.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Prayer of Authority</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When something arises in an assembly that is beyond human control, the church should exercise its authority to pray and ask the Lord to intervene.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a work in a locality is carried out according to the Lord's will, His throne will support and be behind such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like the British embassy in China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is here to represent England, and the ambassador executes the move of the British throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If anyone kills an ambassador, it is an insult to the whole of England.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, if an assembly in a locality is a representative and testimony of the Lord, His authority will be behind this assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If necessary, the responsible ones should exercise the Lord's authority to stop all the frustrating elements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to help people to know that the church is where God's authority lies today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the place where the Lord's throne is established.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anyone who comes to the church should know the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The workers are the representatives of the Lord, and they have the authority of the Lord with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Thessalonians 5:12 and Hebrews 13:7 and 17 indicate that the workers should receive double honor and that others should submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must read these passages to the brothers again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should let them know that there is authority in the church, and that we should obey and honor such authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other Points</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A brother, who was a stone mason, once stood up in a meeting and asked everyone to read John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did this because he liked John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as he said this, George M ller stood up and said, "I can read this for everybody."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he said this, everyone stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although everyone can speak in a meeting, not everyone who speaks can edify others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle of prophesying is to speak that which touches one's inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, the words spoken must be for the building up of others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The principle of tongue-speaking is speaking when one is touched, yet not edifying others with such speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man is touched in his own heart, he is acting in the principle of speaking in tongues if his word does not touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word in 1 Corinthians 14:2-19 is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It says that if a man is touched by anything, what he is touched by must also touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only then can he speak in the meeting because only then will his word build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If something does not build up others, one should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the basic principle of speaking in the meetings.</S>
