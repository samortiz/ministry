</ol>
<p>In this message we will fellowship concerning the ministry of the new covenant. The ministry of the new covenant is the service of the new covenant. We may also say that it is the living of the new covenant. In the new covenant, this service, this ministry, is a living. We cannot separate the living from the service. If we separate these two matters, then our service becomes a performance or a show. An actor who is only twenty years old may play the part of an old man in a theater performance. Although he may act like an old man in the theater, he still lives the life of a twenty-year-old man in his actual living. His acting is merely a performance and has nothing to do with his real daily life. Another actor who is a man may even play the role of a woman. However, the two&mdash;the actor and the woman whom the actor is pretending to be&mdash;are not the same at all. Today we must not serve the Lord in the way of performing. The ministry of the new covenant is the living of the new covenant, and the living of the new covenant is the ministry of the new covenant. The living and the ministry must be one; they cannot be separate.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE NEW TESTAMENT AGE<br />
THERE BEING NO REGULATIONS<br />
BUT ONLY THE LIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Why are we considering this matter of the ministry of the new covenant? We are considering this matter because of our background. The Bible is composed of the Old Testament and the New Testament. If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that in the Old Testament the emphasis is on laws and regulations. The totality of these laws and regulations is known as the letter because all of these laws and regulations were written down sentence by sentence and word by word (2 Cor. 3:6). The Pentateuch, which was written by Moses, talks about the way to keep the Sabbath, the way to offer sacrifices, and the way to slay an animal when offering it&mdash;how to cut the animal, how to skin it, how to drain and apply its blood, and how to burn it. These regulations were all written down sentence by sentence and word by word. They are the letter. The ministry or service of the old covenant was of the letter; thus, an Israelite who came to offer a sacrifice had to follow what Moses had written down. He could not say, &ldquo;I have an idea. Today instead of offering a sacrifice, I will sing a song.&rdquo; This would have been a terrible thing. To do this in the Old Testament times would have been to stray from the Scriptures and to disobey God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>It is quite amazing, however, that the New Testament does not begin with the law of Moses but with the genealogy and origin of Jesus Christ. Who is Jesus Christ? Jesus Christ is the Son of God who became a man, a descendant of David. He was born in a manger in Bethlehem and grew up in Nazareth. When He was thirty years old, He began His ministry, and the Spirit of God descended upon Him. After three and a half years He went to the cross to die, redeeming us from our sins. After He was buried, He resurrected and ascended. Then He descended as the Holy Spirit. In His resurrection, as the last Adam He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>
 <p>The Greek word that we translate <em>spirit</em> can also be translated <em>breath.</em> Breathing is the foremost need of our physical life. A person can live thirty to forty days without food or three to four days without water. However, if a person stops breathing for five minutes, he will die. Our greatest need is to receive air into us, to breathe.</p>
<p>I believe that we all have read the Gospel of John. What is the subject of this Gospel? The Gospel of John says that in the beginning was the Word and that the Word was God (1:1). It also tells us that this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth (v. 14). What is truth? Is truth the same thing as doctrine? It would be wrong to say that the Word was full of grace and doctrine, for truth is reality. The Gospel of John also reveals that the Word who was God and who became flesh is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (v. 29). John 19 further reveals that this One suffered death by crucifixion. While on the cross, blood and water flowed out from His pierced side (v. 34). Then John 20 tells us that He resurrected. Where did He go after He resurrected? We should not say that He went to heaven, because the Gospel of John does not say this. On the night of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the disciples were in fear of the Jews, so they went into a house, closed the doors, and shut themselves inside. They were feeling lost and bewildered. Then suddenly the Lord Jesus stood in their midst. While the disciples stood there, still having doubts, what did the Lord Jesus say to them? Did He tell them, &ldquo;Moses gave you ten commandments, but I am going to double that number and give you twenty commandments. The first commandment is that you shall be zealous, the second commandment is that you shall love others as yourselves, and the third commandment is that you shall lose your life and suffer martyrdom for My sake&rdquo;? Did the Lord Jesus say this? He did not. Then what did the Lord Jesus do while He was there in the midst of the disciples? He did not talk about doctrines; He simply breathed into the disciples. Can you believe that this is what the Lord Jesus did? He was the Son of God, the resurrected Christ, but He did not give them any regulations. Instead, He simply breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). Do not forget that <em>spirit</em> can also be translated <em>breath.</em> Thus, it would be correct to translate the Greek phrase rendered <em>Holy Spirit</em> as <em>Holy Breath.</em> If we were to do this, John 20:20 would say, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Breath.&rdquo; Who is the Holy Breath? The Holy Breath is the Holy Spirit. And who is the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is our wonderful Lord! In the beginning He was the Word who was God. Then He became flesh, and eventually He became breath. This breath is the Spirit.</p>
<p>After breathing into them, the Lord Jesus did not say, &ldquo;Peter and John, My time is up. I have to go. Good-bye.&rdquo; He did not say this. The Gospel of John mentions His appearing to His disciples, but it does not mention His departing from them. Where was the Lord after He breathed into the disciples? He was in each and every one of them. Therefore, when the disciples came together to meet in the evening on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the Lord Jesus appeared to them again. Later some of the disciples went fishing. They fished the whole night but did not catch anything; their nets were empty. The fish did not come, but suddenly the Lord Jesus came. When the disciples first saw Him, they asked themselves, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; Then after watching Him and listening to Him, they realized that He was the Lord. What was the purpose of these events? The purpose of these events was to show the disciples that after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He would be with them in their spirit and would never leave them again. This is also true today. Not only is the Lord with us when we are praying and reading the Bible, but even if we go back to the world to &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; the Lord will go with us.</p>
<p>The point of my fellowship is that in the New Testament there are no regulations or rules; there is only the living Lord Jesus. From beginning to end, the New Testament reveals the living Lord Jesus. If the Lord Jesus were a religious figure, then His religion would need doctrines. Without doctrines there can be no religion. This, however, is not the Lord&rsquo;s way. Thus, the New Testament does not deal with doctrines. Every book of the Bible speaks about the Lord Jesus and tells us many things about Him. The Bible reveals that the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom (2 Cor. 3:17). It also declares that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The Lord is the Spirit, not a doctrine. He is the Spirit, not the letter. Thus, today when we serve God in the new covenant, we should serve not according to doctrines but according to the living Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT OF THE LETTER BUT OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Jews invented Judaism based upon the Old Testament, and Christians invented Christianity based upon the New Testament in addition to the Old Testament. However, if we read the Bible, we can find the terms <em>Christ</em> and <em>Christians</em> (which means &ldquo;Christ-men&rdquo;), but we cannot find the term <em>Christianity</em>. This is because Christianity is man&rsquo;s invention and is apart from Christ.</p>
<p>Then what is the chief concern of Christianity? We should not say that Christianity is primarily concerned with Christ, because this is not the case. Christianity is primarily concerned with religious doctrines. Every religion has its doctrines. I would like to ask all of you whether or not you are in Christianity. If I asked you, and you said that you were not in any religion at all, I would not believe you. My disbelief has a basis. For example, your worship of the Lord is according to a schedule and a procedure. When you arrive at the meeting hall, you sit quietly and wait until a responsible brother calls a hymn before you sing. After singing the hymn, you know that the singing will be followed by prayer. Then after the prayer there is always a brother who stands up to read the Bible and give a message. Is this religion or not? Surely it is religion, but what kind of religion is this? This is not the Christian religion; this is a &ldquo;self-religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope that you will not be offended, but as your brother, I must speak frankly and truthfully. I am afraid that many brothers and sisters are still in a self-religion. For example, some may say, &ldquo;I do not agree with disorderly meetings in which there is yelling and shouting. I would rather have quiet meetings.&rdquo; This is a kind of self-religion. At the same time, those who like to shout may say, &ldquo;When we meet, we must shout, because if there is no shouting, the meetings are not exciting enough.&rdquo; This is another kind of self-religion. The form of religion adopted by those who prefer to be quiet is like the religion of the Pharisees, and the form of religion adopted by those who shout is like the religion of John the Baptist. You may have thrown out the old religion of Christianity, but you have brought in a new religion. If you strongly advocate quietness, then you have a quiet religion. If you insist on shouting, then you have a shouting religion. Both are forms of religion.</p>
<p>You may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are too hard on us. Did you not bring in the practice of shouting among us?&rdquo; I did bring in this practice. This can be likened to John the Baptist&rsquo;s introduction of the practice of baptism. However, just as John the Baptist did not form a baptism religion, I did not lead you into a shouting religion. Neither shouting nor quietness should be a regulation. In fact, we should not have any regulations.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may ask, &ldquo;If we should not have any regulations, then what should we do?&rdquo; By asking what you should do, you are again being religious. My answer for you is, &ldquo;Do not do anything.&rdquo; Having received this answer, I know that you will want to ask, &ldquo;How do we not do anything?&rdquo; You must realize that in asking for a method, you are doing what religious people do. Our focus should not be on methods.</p>
<p>In Matthew 11:18-19 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;John came neither eating nor drinking....The Son of Man came eating and drinking.&rdquo; John was the Lord&rsquo;s forerunner. Since John abstained from eating and drinking, logically the Lord should have done likewise. However, the Lord Jesus did not do as John did because the Lord was not under any regulations.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may say, &ldquo;You are making things too difficult for us, so we give up. We will not come to the meetings anymore. It is too difficult here! We changed from being quiet to being loud, but now that we are loud, you still do not approve of us. You are not only against being quiet; you are also against shouting. What do you really want?&rdquo; Dear brothers and sisters, you are absolutely right. We do not care for regulations; we care only for the Lord. How can we care only for the Lord? We can do this by being in the Spirit. Our Lord is the living God and the living Spirit. The entire New Testament talks about the Spirit and reveals that the Spirit eventually becomes the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). Today the Spirit is the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</p>
<p>Today Christians have turned the Lord into a religious leader and the church into a religion. Although we have left the sects, denominations, and old Christianity, we have formed a new religion&mdash;a self-religion. If we read the publications of Watchman Nee, we will realize that he had this feeling many years ago. For example, he said that the practice of having one man preach a sermon every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning is a custom of the Gentiles, the nations. When he spoke of the nations, he meant the denominations. He said that we should get rid of the pulpit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and go out to preach the gospel. His speaking concerning this was published in 1948, but it was not until 1968 that we got rid of the pulpit. The Lord&rsquo;s Day pulpit was so difficult to get rid of because everyone was accustomed to the old practice.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, I hope that you can understand what I am saying. The Lord is not our religious leader, and He did not give us a religion. His words in the Bible are not mere doctrines and teachings. All of His words are spirit. The Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). The Lord Himself is Spirit, and what comes out from Him is spirit. Today as we are serving God in the new covenant to fulfill our ministry, we should not be in the realm of doctrine and the letter. We need to see that our Lord is the Spirit and that we need to be in the realm of the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">IN NEWNESS OF SPIRIT<br />
AND NOT IN OLDNESS OF LETTER</h2>
<p>How can we be in the realm of the spirit? Suppose that there are four brothers who love the Lord very much and often have fellowship with Him. (Remember that the Lord whom they love is neither a doctrine nor a religion; He is the Spirit). Suppose that these four brothers come to a meeting with their Bibles under their arms, sit down one by one, and then remain sitting in their seats. If I saw this, I would ask them, &ldquo;Why are you just sitting here?&rdquo; They might answer, &ldquo;We are sitting here quietly because it is not yet time for the meeting to begin.&rdquo; Then I would ask, &ldquo;Is the Lord, whom you serve, inside of you?&rdquo; If they say yes, then I would say to them, &ldquo;Then do you care about the time or about the Lord? If you care about the Lord, then you should not sit here idly. The time has not yet arrived, but you have arrived! Do not take care of the time. Take care of the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may say that we love and serve the living Lord and that we fellowship with Him, but in actuality we may be religious people. When we come to meet, we may not care whether the Lord is living or not. Rather, we may care for the time, we may wait for the responsible brothers to call the hymns, and we may want all the meetings to be carried out step by step in an organized way. This is to be religious.</p>
<p>How can we avoid being religious? Only when we are in the Spirit are we not in religion. I love my Lord, and my Lord is the living Spirit, so I have fellowship with Him from morning to evening. If I were a saint with a job, then after I get off from work in the afternoon and have dinner and a little rest, I would leave for the meeting at six-thirty. I would do this because the meeting starts at seven-thirty. While I am on my way, I would begin to sing, &ldquo;Victory, victory, Hallelujah!&rdquo; I would not sing the same hymn every day. In fact, I might not even sing a hymn that is in the hymnal. I would simply sing according to inspiration. While I am walking on the street, I would sing. Singing on the street is better than singing in a place of worship. If I choose to ride the bus, I would also sing and pray on the bus. I might pray, &ldquo;O Lord! Bless all those who are taking this bus! Save all of them, including the bus driver!&rdquo; Our service today is simply our living. Thus, when a sister goes shopping for groceries, she can shout, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord! Hallelujah! Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; as she is shopping. Someone may ask her if she is insane, but she can answer, &ldquo;I am not insane; I am beside myself with Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the way that we should come to the meetings. The meetings should start in our home. Then all the way to the meeting we should either be praising, singing, or praying. When we arrive at the meeting hall, we can begin to praise, even if we are the only one there. Dear brothers and sisters, we should not have regulations anymore. Throughout the generations God has been working against regulations. Today we are in the end times, and the Lord is coming soon. The Lord wants to do a swift work and to take a fast way. Thus, He can no longer tolerate our way, in which we maintain our regulations.</p>
<p>Today the service of the new covenant is not of the letter but of the spirit. Thus, we should not take any practice and make it into a habitual practice. We have to be new every day. We need to do away with the oldness of the letter and serve in newness of spirit. Our Lord is a living God and a living Spirit. Today He lives not only in heaven but also within us. We can have fellowship with Him and look to Him for the cleansing of His blood. Moreover, where the blood is applied, the ointment is applied, and where there is the precious blood, there is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When we come to meet, we should not care for the letter or for regulations; we should care only for the living Spirit. Praising the Lord and calling on His name will draw out our spirit. As a result, we will be filled with the presence of the Lord inwardly. With the presence of the Lord, we will be enlightened and burning within. One who is filled with the Spirit of the Lord will be burning inwardly since the Lord is not only the watering Spirit but also the burning Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are burning, we are set free. The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. This freedom, which is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17, implies freedom from regulations and freedom from the letter of the law. The letter of the law veils us. When we are filled with the Spirit of the Lord inwardly, the veil is taken away, and we are set free. Then with an unveiled face we behold the Lord as a mirror. As a mirror we reflect the glory of the Lord and are transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory. How are we transformed? We are transformed not by doctrines but from the Lord Spirit. This is the ministry of the new covenant and the service of the new covenant. May the Lord have mercy on us to deliver us from all methods, creeds, regulations, and doctrines so that we will live in the Spirit under His precious blood.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

</ol>
<p>In this message we will fellowship concerning the way to enjoy Christ. We do not care for methods, but we do have a certain way to enjoy Christ. We should forsake all methods, but we should also walk on a way. Where can we see the way to enjoy Christ? We can find it in 1 Corinthians. First Corinthians shows us that the way to enjoy Christ is in our spirit. How can we enjoy Christ in our spirit? Let us consider this matter step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE PORTION OF ALL THOSE<br />
WHO CALL UPON HIS NAME</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is &ldquo;theirs and ours.&rdquo; This phrase is very precious. Christ belongs to us all! Christ belongs to the brothers, and Christ belongs also to the sisters. Christ belongs to the elderly saints, and Christ belongs also to the young people. Christ belongs to the strong ones, and Christ belongs also to the weak ones. This verse tells us that Christ belongs to all those who call upon His name. The Greek word for <em>call upon</em> means &ldquo;to call out audibly, even loudly.&rdquo; For example, when a house is on fire, we call out, &ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; We do not simply shout; we call out for help.</p>
<p>Someone once said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, the Lord is not so deaf that He cannot hear our voice. Why do we need to cry and shout? I do not think that we need to do this.&rdquo; Perhaps there are others who think this as well. I am not here to subdue you, but I must tell you the truth. Consider your experience from the day that you were saved until now. Have you ever called upon the name of the Lord? I can confidently say that you have. Every Christian has called on the Lord. A few days ago I heard a testimony given by a sister. Not long after she was saved, she was hit by a car and was in great pain. No one had ever taught her to call on the Lord; nevertheless, she called, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; After she had called on the Lord a few times, miraculously her pain went away. You may say that you have never called upon the name of the Lord&mdash;you even may be hard-hearted, but the Lord still has a way to deal with you, and when He does, you will call louder than everyone else. To whom does Christ belong? Christ belongs to those who call upon His name! When you call on the Lord, He becomes your portion.</p>
 <p>God has given us Jesus Christ as our portion. He has also called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ (v. 9). For us to be called into His fellowship is for us to be called into His enjoyment. God has not called us to go to heaven; He has called us to enter into His enjoyment, His fellowship. Thus, every day we should enjoy the Lord, live in fellowship with the Lord, and take the Lord as our portion.</p>
<p>In addition to being our portion, the Lord is also the power of God and the wisdom of God (v. 24). To accomplish anything, we need power and wisdom. For instance, suppose we want to establish a large corporation. To do so, we must have sufficient funds as capital. Our capital is our power. However, if we have sufficient funds but lack the intelligence to manage a company, we will not be able to accomplish anything. Our capital is our power, and our intelligence is our wisdom. If we have both, surely our corporation will prosper. The &ldquo;capital&rdquo; of the large &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; of God is simply Christ Himself, and the way, or wisdom, that God uses to manage this large corporation is also Christ Himself. Christ is power and Christ is wisdom.</p>
<p>As Christians we are in Christ. Who put us in Christ? God put us in Christ. God put us in Christ, and God wants Christ to become wisdom to us. Christ becomes wisdom to us as righteousness for our past, as sanctification for our present, and as redemption for our future (v. 30). As our righteousness the Lord covers all of our shameful past, as our sanctification the Lord enables us to live a sanctified life in the present, and as our redemption the Lord will redeem and transfigure our body in the future. This is the way that the Lord becomes wisdom to us.</p>
<p>Thus, we see that Christ is five major items: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. In addition to these five major items Christ is another ten major items: the foundation (3:11), the Passover (5:7), our spiritual food, drink, and rock (10:3-4), the Head (11:3), the Body (12:12), the firstfruits (15:20, 23), the last Adam (v. 45), and the second man (v. 47). In other words, Christ is the first, the second, and the last. Hence, Christ is everything, Christ is all things, and there is nothing that is outside of Christ. All of the grace of God is in Christ, and Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING<br />
THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord that the all-inclusive Christ, who is so full, has become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life (v. 45b; 2 Cor. 3:6b). This Christ has become the Spirit, and as the Spirit He is power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. As the Spirit He is also the foundation, the Passover, our spiritual food, drink, and rock, the Head, the Body, the first, the second, and the last. Everything is included in the Spirit, for the Spirit is all-inclusive.</p>
<p>Where is the Spirit today? He is in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; In addition, we all have been baptized into the Spirit. On the day that we called upon His name and were saved, we were baptized into the Spirit. Since we all have been baptized, let us now drink of this Spirit (12:13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD<br />
TO DRINK OF THE LORD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>How do we drink of the Spirit? It is very easy&mdash;we simply call on the Lord. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In other words, if we simply say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we will be in the Holy Spirit and will also drink of this Spirit.</p>
<p>How do we let air into our room? It is very easy&mdash;we simply open a window. Suppose we shut all the doors and windows and then kneel down to pray, &ldquo;Lord! Please give us fresh air! We want fresh air to come in!&rdquo; No matter how much we pray this, the Lord will not answer our prayer. If we want fresh air, we must open a window. Similarly, we are already in the Lord, so if we want to drink of the Lord, the way to do so is to open our &ldquo;window.&rdquo; What is our window? Our window is our mouth. We simply need to open our mouth and call on the Lord from our spirit, calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; When we do this, we will genuinely be in our spirit and will genuinely drink the Lord.</p>
<p>I am afraid that some of you who love the Lord and have intimate fellowship with the Lord have never called on the Lord like this. If you have not, you should try it. Sisters, when your children disobey you, the best thing to do is to say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; After you say &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; five times, see if your children are still misbehaving. Brothers, when your wife is nagging you, do not argue with her. The more you argue, the more she will nag. The more you reason with her, the more she will justify herself. You can never clear up such a situation by reasoning. Therefore, when your wife is bothering you, simply say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; Sisters, when your husband loses his temper, do not argue with him. Simply declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; A certain brother in the United States has been helped greatly by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. Whenever his wife loses her temper, he simply declares, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; After he declares this a few times, his wife calms down and says, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Their children, seeing the testimony of their parents, follow with, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; Then the whole family is happy. This is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>We should not think that tempers come from bad dispositions. Actually, tempers come from little demons. When people lose their temper, they are &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; by demons. What can cast out the demons? Only the mighty name of the Lord Jesus can cast out the demons. For instance, suppose your wife loses her temper, becomes irrational, and the demons prevail. Do not argue with her. You must declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; After such a declaration, the demons will run away in fear, and your wife will be released.</p>
<p>When young sisters have to walk in dark alleys or isolated areas, they may feel frightened. However, they do not need to be afraid. They should simply declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; When they declare this, who are they declaring it to? They are declaring this to the demons and the evil spirits in the air! We should declare &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; in every place. Some cannot sleep at night, so they count sheep. However, most of the time this does not work. The best cure for insomnia is to declare &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; and to keep on declaring this. You will not need to declare this too many times, for soon you will fall asleep. Then you will sleep soundly until the morning.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, do not think that I am speaking nonsense. Please try declaring the Lord&rsquo;s name. If you cannot overcome your temper, simply declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; Whenever you are faced with something that you cannot overcome, simply declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; The name of Jesus is above every name, and in the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue will openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Phil. 2:10-11). Since this is the case, there is no reason that we should not take the lead to declare His name.</p>
<p>Recently, some of the brothers and sisters in San Francisco have been greatly blessed. When they go to work in the morning, they wear gospel robes, and while driving to work, they shout, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; Some of the saints who are students also wear gospel robes to school. They walk around the campus wearing gospel robes, they eat in the cafeteria wearing gospel robes, and they come home wearing gospel robes. In addition, when they see each other, they shout, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; This is wonderful!</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we cannot be dumb Christians. We must call on the name of the Lord. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is the way to drink the Lord and to enjoy the Lord. We all should try calling on the name of the Lord. The more we call, the more we will have the presence of the Lord. Suppose that when we come together to meet, we all come with our Bibles tucked under our arms, and we all keep quiet and sit silently in our seats. What sort of meetings would we have? Suppose, however, that we all shout, &ldquo;O Lord! Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; as we enter the meeting hall. If we do this, the meetings will be enlivened, and the Spirit will flow.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us and cause us to see that our Lord is not a religion, a doctrine, a teaching, or a ritual. May we all see that He is the living Spirit, and that today He is in our spirit. We must also see the way to enjoy Him. How do we do this? We enjoy Him by calling on His name. When we call on His name, we touch Him, we are released, and we are supplied.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must all call on the name of the Lord, but we must not forget that in addition to calling on the Lord and enjoying the Lord, we also need to walk in the spirit every day. Each of us needs to be a spiritual man (1 Cor. 2:15). What kind of person is a spiritual man? He is a person who lives in the spirit. When we wake up in the morning, we may be busy, and we may not have the opportunity to kneel down and have a time with the Lord. However, when we are washing our face or making our bed, we can call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Amen! O Lord! Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; In addition, if we memorize a verse or two, we can pray-read while we are doing our chores. In this way we will be able to enjoy the Lord even if we do not have much time. Because we have enjoyed the Lord, we will then be able to walk according to Him in our daily living. We will not follow our will, our emotion, our logic, or the outward circumstances. We will simply follow the Lord whom we enjoy. The Lord is the Spirit, and He is in our spirit. When we walk according to Him, we will have a spiritual living, and we will experience Christ in a practical way. Then when we come to the meetings and shout, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; this will not be merely a performance. Our meetings and our living will have been blended together, and the two will be one.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Lord is the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
<li>The Lord as the Spirit is the treasure in us as earthen vessels&mdash;4:7.</li>
<li>Because we have the Lord as life in our spirit, our spirit becomes our inner man&mdash;Eph. 3:16.</li>
<li>Our inner man takes Christ as the person&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
<li>Our outer man needs to decay so that our inner man may be renewed&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
<li>We are being transformed into the image of the Lord, even as from the Lord Spirit, by the renewing of our inner man&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2.</li>
<li>To be transformed by the renewing of the mind requires the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to be with us&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this message we will consider the renewing of the inner man. This subject is both profound and fine. In order to make progress in spiritual matters, we need to learn to go deeper into them and to touch them in a deep and detailed way. This will be our approach as we consider the renewing of the inner man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING A SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our physical body is outward and superficial. However, within our body we have something that is most precious, something that neither scientists nor medical doctors are able to locate. This is our spirit (Job 32:8). The Bible clearly reveals that man has three parts. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.&rdquo; This verse distinguishes the spirit from the soul, putting the word <em>and</em> between the two words. This clearly shows us that the spirit and the soul are two different things.</p>
<p>The genuineness of our person is our spirit. Sometimes when we smile, our smile may not be genuine. Genuineness comes not only from the heart but also from the spirit. When we lose our temper, our spirit comes out. At that moment we are being genuine. If we become indignant or infuriated, our spirit really comes out. When we get angry to such an extent, we forget about our rationality, our face, and our relationship with others. As a result, our spirit is released. This kind of release of the spirit, however, is not normal but abnormal. Nevertheless, in such a situation our spirit does come out. The spirit of most people is not released easily. It is even more difficult for the spirit of a person who is very patient and refined to be released, for even when such a person is furious within, outwardly he can appear quite rational and cheerful. He knows how to control himself, but he is not genuine. His refined manner is a pretense.</p>
<p>We can illustrate the three parts of man with three concentric circles. The outer circle represents man&rsquo;s body, the middle circle, which is within the outer circle, represents man&rsquo;s soul, and the inner circle, which is within the middle circle, represents man&rsquo;s spirit. Man&rsquo;s soul is within his body, and man&rsquo;s spirit is within his soul. Everyone is familiar with the body, but the soul is a bit more complicated. Man&rsquo;s soul has three parts. The first part, which is the leading part, is the mind. The mind is the faculty by which we think. The mind can consider, memorize, comprehend, infer, and analyze. The emotion, which is the second part of the soul, is also quite strong. The emotion can love, desire, hate, and have joy or sorrow. The third part of the soul is the will. The will can make plans and decisions. Thus, the soul is composed of these three parts&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>On the one hand, human beings have a spirit. On the other hand, the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The fact that the Lord is the Spirit implies three things. The first thing it implies is that, according to God&rsquo;s nature, God is Spirit. This is similar to saying that the nature of a table is wood or that the nature of a metal pipe is iron. The second thing it implies is that, according to God&rsquo;s economy, God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In God&rsquo;s economy, which is God&rsquo;s way to accomplish His work, first, God is the Father; second, He is the Son; and third, He is the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the One who enters into us. The third thing that this fact implies is that, according to God&rsquo;s plan of redemption, the Lord Jesus was incarnated to become a man, the last Adam, and that one day the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, after the Lord Jesus accomplished everything on the cross, God&rsquo;s plan of redemption is still a matter of the Spirit. Thus, the entire Bible can be summarized by the statement <em>the Lord is the Spirit.</em> The Spirit includes God Himself, God&rsquo;s economy, and God&rsquo;s redemption. This is why we can say that the Spirit is all-inclusive. Today the God we worship and the Lord we serve is the Spirit. In fact, everything related to our God and our Lord is a matter of the Spirit. The Spirit who is within us today is truly a treasure.</p>
<p>Man is different from the beasts, because man has a spirit inside of him. Moreover, those who are saved are different from those who are not saved, because those who are saved not only have a human spirit, they also have received the Lord as the Spirit into them. Thus, as saved ones, we truly have reason to shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; We have something that the unbelievers do not have&mdash;we have the Lord Himself in our spirit. How do we know that the Lord, who is the Spirit, has come into this particular part of our being? We know this because the Bible clearly says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). The Lord is Spirit, and as the Spirit, He enters into and lives in our spirit, causing us to be joined to Him as one spirit. The Bible also says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:22a; Rom. 8:16). These verses prove that the Lord as the Spirit is in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTER MAN AND THE INNER MAN</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the difference between the outer man and the inner man. We have already stated that man is composed of three parts&mdash;body, soul, and spirit. Now we must ask, which of these three parts is our real person? Neither our body nor our spirit is our real person; our real person is our soul. We can see this in Genesis 2:7. This verse begins, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man with the dust of the ground....&rdquo; This refers to the way in which God formed our body. Then this verse continues, &ldquo;and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life....&rdquo; This refers to the creation of man&rsquo;s spirit. Finally, this verse ends, &ldquo;and man became a living soul.&rdquo; This final expression indicates that man&rsquo;s person is the soul, for man became a living soul. In addition, there are also other verses in which the Bible uses the term <em>souls</em> to refer to persons. When the seventy members of Jacob&rsquo;s family went down to Egypt, Exodus 1:5 refers to them as &ldquo;seventy souls&rdquo; (lit., Hebrew) rather than as seventy persons; and when three thousand people received the Lord and were baptized on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2:41 says, &ldquo;There were added on that day about three thousand souls.&rdquo; From these verses we can see that a person is a soul, and the soul is the person. In other words, the soul is the self and the personality.</p>
<p>Our body is an outward organ for contacting the physical world, and our spirit is an inward organ for contacting the spiritual world. Only our soul is our person. Originally, our spirit is merely an organ, but when Christ comes into our spirit, He comes into us as a person. Now we have a person in our spirit. As a result, our spirit, which now has a person and a life within it, is no longer only an organ. It has become a person. Formerly, we had only one person inside of us&mdash;the soul. However, now that the Lord has entered into our spirit to become the life of our spirit, our spirit has become a person. Thus, today we have two persons within us&mdash;our soul is the old man, the outer man, and our spirit is our new person, the inner man.</p>
<p>Since we now have two persons within us, I would pose the question, &ldquo;Is it better to have one person or to have two persons within us?&rdquo; Consider what it is like for two people to live together in the same room. Is it better to have one person or to have two persons live in one room? Nearly all would say that it is better to live alone. Why do we prefer to live alone? We prefer to live alone because when we live alone, we have more freedom. If we live alone, we have no one to bother us. We can open or close the doors and the windows as we please. As soon as two persons begin to live together, however, there is trouble. One person wants to open the window, but the other person wants to close the window. Right away there is the question of who should listen to whom. On the one hand, we cannot deny that it is a blessing that we are saved, for the Lord has come into us as a genuine treasure (2 Cor. 4:7). But on the other hand, it is also true that because the Lord has come into us, we experience some trouble. Before we were saved, it may have been very natural for us to tell a lie now and then, to occasionally play mah-jongg with our friends, and to curse when we lost our temper. This may have been the situation before we were saved, but what is our experience now? On the day that we were saved, Christ as the treasure came into us. Now if we want to tell a lie, we do not have peace. When we want to lie, He does not want to lie. Moreover, to do something like playing mah-jongg is now entirely out of the question. When we want to play mah-jongg, the Lord is not only unhappy about this, He even gets angry. Who can deny that this is troublesome?</p>
<p>Faced with this troublesome situation, what should we do? The Bible reveals that it is not good for us to have two persons within us at the same time. Thus, we must get rid of one of them. If we must do this, which one should we get rid of? Surely we must get rid of the old man. Romans 6:6 declares that &ldquo;our old man has been crucified with Him,&rdquo; and Galatians 2:20 states, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live.&rdquo; When the old man is crucified, the new man is enlivened.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</h2>
<p>We all need to be clear that the Lord Jesus is in us not only as life but also as a person. Every man has a person within him, but those who have received the Lord into them as life have also received the Lord into them as another person. Thus, we need to see that the Lord is in us today not only as life but also as a person.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:16-17 says that we need to be strengthened with power into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts. The fact that Christ wants to make home within us indicates that He is a person. Thus, the question is, who is the person inside of us? Is the self the person, or is the Lord Jesus the person? It is true that the Lord Jesus is inside of us, but He can be inside of us in different ways. For example, you may receive me into your home, but this does not mean that I can make myself at home. Although you have invited me into your home, I am still only a guest. If you lead me into the living room and tell me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we have prepared this room for you,&rdquo; then I can have the freedom to use that room. This does not mean, however, that I can move into any of the other rooms in your house. When I am in your house, everything is decided by you, not by me.</p>
<p>Today the Lord Jesus is inside of us, but will He be able to possess our whole being, or will we force Him to stay only in our spirit? Frankly, some brothers and sisters confine the Lord Jesus to a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; within them. You might be thinking, &ldquo;Since Christmas is almost here, I will buy a few presents and send them to my children in the United States.&rdquo; While you are thinking this, the Lord is in the &ldquo;living room&rdquo; of your spirit. However, in response to your plans, the Lord may try to come into the &ldquo;room&rdquo; of your mind, yet when He tries to do this, right away you shut the door to your mind, saying, &ldquo;Lord! Please sit in the living room; do not come in here.&rdquo; If this is the situation, then the Lord has not made His home within you.</p>
<p>One day a sister may come to a meeting and see a dress worn by one of the other sisters. Upon seeing the dress, she may be stirred up in her emotions because she likes the dress very much. As a result, she may quickly note the brand of the dress and ask the other sister where she bought it. However, while the sister is preparing to go out and buy the dress, the Lord Jesus may come to interfere with her plans. The Lord may begin by asking her, &ldquo;Do you really want to buy that dress?&rdquo; However, the sister may reply, &ldquo;Lord, please stay in the living room. It does not feel so comfortable when you try to come into the room of my emotion. Please do not come in.&rdquo; We all have experiences like this. There are many parts within us that we do not allow the Lord to enter into. We do not want Him to interfere with what takes place in these parts of our being. Thus, we force the Lord to stay in our spirit.</p>
<p>Because our tendency is to force the Lord to stay in our spirit, the apostle Paul prayed for us. He prayed that we would be strengthened into the inner man, so that as a result the Lord Jesus would be able to make His home in our hearts. For the Lord to make His home in our hearts means that He is able to go from our spirit to our conscience and from our conscience to our mind, emotion, and will, thus occupying our entire heart. Only when the Lord has this freedom will He be able to make His home in our hearts.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus does not like to stay only in our spirit. He likes to visit our mind, emotion, and will. Moreover, once He has visited these parts, He does not want to leave; He wants to fully occupy them. This is what it means for Christ to make His home in our hearts. The Lord has indeed come into our spirit, but He is waiting in our spirit for a chance to spread His influence from our spirit into every corner, every part, of our being. The Lord wants to spread His influence in our being to the extent that if He does not move in our mind, we will not think about buying things, if He does not move in our emotion, we will not give our love to anything, and if He does not move in our will, we will not make any plans or decisions.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus gains the ground in every part of our being, He will then be able to make His home in our hearts. Thus, we must learn the lesson that as believers we are meant not only to rely on His power and live by His life but also to receive His entire person into us to be our person. This lesson is both deep and fine.</p>
<p>If we receive the Lord Jesus as our person in this way, our outer man will be consumed every day. The Lord will cause circumstances to rise up to consume our outer man, but as He is doing this, He will also cause our inner man to be renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). This is the meaning of John 3:30&mdash;&ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo; Our inner man, the new man, is Christ Himself. Christ must increase within us. Our outer man, the old man, is the self. The self must gradually decrease. The result of this increase and decrease will be that we no longer live but that Christ lives in us as our person (cf. Gal. 2:20). Then Christ will not only be our life, He will also live in us as our person. Hence, each of us will be able to declare, &ldquo;For to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21).</p>
<p>This is a very sweet matter. Our inner man is being renewed and is expanding day by day. This will happen to the extent that one day even our body will express the glory of the Lord. In the end we will be transformed into His image, from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). Brothers and sisters, this is what the Lord desires to gain today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

</ol>
<p>In this message we want to touch a matter that is very delicate. Thus, we must not do a rough work but a delicate one. The electrician who installs the lights in a building drills holes, fastens screws, and runs wires. This kind of work is rough. The work to install the lights is rough, but inside a light bulb itself, there is a filament that is very delicate. This filament cannot be handled in a rough way. We may say that in this message we have come to the filament inside the light bulb.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD SPIRIT AND OUR SPIRIT<br />
BEING MINGLED TO BECOME ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Man can be likened to a light bulb. In fact, this is a very fitting comparison. The sole function of a light bulb is to express electricity&mdash;if a light bulb is not filled with electricity and does not shine, it is vain and useless. In the same way, if we do not have God and do not express God, we are vain and useless. Like light bulbs created to be filled with and to express electricity, we were created by God for Himself that we might be filled with Him and express Him.</p>
<p>The most important part of a light bulb is the filament. Similarly, our most important part is our spirit. We are like light bulbs, and our spirit is the &ldquo;filament&rdquo; within us. Any problem with our filament causes us to be insulated from God. Because our ancestor sinned, we were born in sin. Sin defiled our conscience, which is the most important part of our spirit, and as a result, our spirit became deadened. Thus, our filament was broken, and we were disconnected from God. Ephesians 4:18 reveals that we became &ldquo;alienated from the life of God.&rdquo; In electrical terms, we became insulated. When a light bulb&rsquo;s filament burns out, the light bulb is insulated, disconnected, from its supply of electricity. As a result, it does not shine.</p>
<p>Every fallen sinner has a broken filament and is disconnected from God. However, the gospel is that the Lord Jesus came, died for us on the cross, and redeemed us from our sins. When we repent and believe into Him, His precious blood washes away our sins, and the Lord, who is the Spirit, contacts our spirit. On the one hand, He restores our spirit itself; on the other hand, He comes to live in our spirit, to be joined to our spirit, and to be mingled with our spirit as one. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is too great. Not only is our inward contact with the Lord restored, but also we are mingled with Him.</p>
<p>The meal offering in the Old Testament is made from fine flour mingled with oil (Lev. 2:1). The meal offering is a type of the Lord Jesus, who is a meal offering to God. The oil in the meal offering typifies the Holy Spirit, and the fine flour typifies the Lord&rsquo;s human living. Therefore, the mingling of the oil with the flour typifies the mingling of the Holy Spirit with humanity. Through this mingling, the two&mdash;the oil and the flour&mdash;became one in the meal offering. Neither the oil nor the flour changed&mdash;the two remained the same&mdash;but the two were mingled together to become one.</p>
<p>Similar to the mingling of oil with fine flour, God has come into us and has been mingled with us to become one. God is the oil, and we are the fine flour. If fine flour is without oil, it is hard and dry, but if oil is added to flour and mingled with it, the flour becomes soft and moist. We can all testify that this picture matches our experience. Before we were saved, we were &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;dry.&rdquo; But after we were saved, we started to become &ldquo;soft&rdquo; and &ldquo;moist&rdquo; inwardly. Moreover, as we call, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen,&rdquo; more oil is added into us, we are mingled with the Lord more, and we become more moist and less dry within.</p>
<p>The salvation of the Lord is not to change us outwardly but to mingle Himself with us inwardly. He is the oil, and He wants to mingle with us in our spirit. Originally, our spirit was by itself, but now the Spirit has been added to our spirit, joined to our spirit, and mingled with our spirit. Therefore, we can say that our spirit is now a doubled or twofold spirit.</p>
<p>This twofold spirit, which is two spirits mingled to become one spirit, is often mentioned in the Bible. This is a problem for Bible translators, for they often cannot determine whether certain verses are referring to the human spirit or to the divine Spirit (cf. Rom. 8:4-6). Praise the Lord that these two spirits&mdash;the divine Spirit and the human spirit&mdash;have been mingled to become one spirit. The divine Spirit has been mingled with the human spirit, and our human spirit has been mingled with the divine Spirit. This is truly a mystery.</p>
<p>Please consider the following question&mdash;when you are praying, who is praying? If you are praying alone by yourself, then your prayer is too poor. Moreover, if this is the only kind of prayer you know, it may be that you are not yet saved. If you are saved, then the Lord as the Spirit lives in your spirit. Thus, when you pray with your spirit, on the one hand, you are praying; on the other hand, the Lord is praying within your spirit.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:12 says, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rdquo; This verse refers to what the Lord has been doing since His resurrection. However, have you ever seen the Lord Jesus singing hymns in the church? Surely, you have never seen this. Then how does the Lord Jesus do this? What does this verse mean? If we are genuinely in our spirit when we sing hymns, then the Lord Jesus is singing in our singing. Someone once asked me, &ldquo;Should we or should we not shout and sing loudly?&rdquo; I answered them, &ldquo;The question is not whether we should or should not shout or sing loudly, but whether we have the confidence that the Lord is shouting when we are shouting and singing loudly when we are singing loudly. If you want to shout, but He does not want to shout, then you should not shout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If before you were saved, you liked to sing popular, worldly, music, try to sing this kind of music now that you have been saved and see if the Lord Jesus will sing with you. If you try to do this, you will feel uneasy within. When you sing worldly music, something will stir within you and discourage you from doing so. This inner stirring is the Lord&rsquo;s disapproval of your singing. When you sing hymns of praise to the Lord, however, you will feel something encouraging you from within and motivating you to praise. This inner encouragement is the Lord&rsquo;s delighting in your praise. In this case, when you are praising, the Lord is also praising, and when you are singing, the Lord is also singing.</p>
<p>According to the same principle, when we are praying in our spirit, the Lord is also praying. Andrew Murray was the most spiritual person at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century. One time he said that the best and highest prayer is the Christ within us praying to the Christ sitting on the throne in the heavens. When we pray this kind of prayer, we are praying, and Christ is also praying. How is it possible for us and Christ to pray together in this way? This is possible because the Lord as the Spirit has been joined together with our spirit to become one spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">SETTING THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In addition to a spirit, we also have a soul within us. Our soul, which is between our body and our spirit, is our person. The most important part of the soul is the mind. A person is generally governed by the thoughts in his mind. For this reason we must guard our mind. The devil is most vigilant, and he is very good at utilizing our mind. For example, when a sister wakes up in the morning, a thought may come into her mind. She may think, &ldquo;My husband mistreated me yesterday.&rdquo; If she accepts this thought, other thoughts will follow. As a result, she will have a long face when she gets out of bed. She will not want to look at her husband, and she may feel hateful toward him. Then the devil will use her hateful feelings and her long face to put a thought into her husband&rsquo;s mind. The husband will then think, &ldquo;Why does my wife have such a negative expression on her face?&rdquo; This thought will give him a long face as well. Then when the sister sees her husband&rsquo;s long face, the expression on her face will grow even worse. In the end, one of the two will throw their chopsticks on the floor, and the two will begin to fight verbally and maybe even physically. This is an example of how Satan uses the minds of a sister and her husband as a battlefield. Please do not think that I am joking. On the contrary, I am telling you real stories.</p>
<p>What does someone who has learned the spiritual lessons do when Satan puts a thought into his mind? At that very moment, he sets his mind on the spirit. We need to learn how to do this. The mind is between the flesh and the spirit. The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace (Rom. 8:6).</p>
<p>There are many people, things, and matters around us that are placed there to tempt us and to stir up our mind. When our mind is stirred up by these temptations, our mind is set on the flesh, and the result is death. If the sisters do not believe me, they should visit a big department store. Then they will see that every display window tempts them. Every pair of shoes in the first window looks good, every hat in the second window looks great, and every skirt in the third window looks even better. Everything is a temptation to us, so what should we do? If we give in to the temptations, the result will be death. What we need to do is to call on the name of the Lord. I know for a fact that if the sisters call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; as they are picking up a pair of shoes, the One within them will tell them to drop the shoes; if they call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; as they are taking a skirt off of a rack of clothes, the One within them will tell them to put the skirt back; if they call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; as they are approaching the next rack, before they could even pick anything up, the One within them will tell them to keep walking; and if they call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; as they are approaching the next rack, the One within them will tell them to go home. If they genuinely obey the Lord and go home, they will be filled with joy and peace within. Then when they come to the meeting that evening, their spirit will be strong, and their speaking will be full of strength.</p>
<p>We must realize that every person, matter, and thing around us can be a tool used by the devil. If we are not watchful, even we can be used by him. This is why we need to set our mind on the spirit continuously. Everything around us tempts us, so our best protection is to turn back to our spirit. How do we do this? We turn back to our spirit by becoming like one who is deaf and blind&mdash;unable to hear or see anything&mdash;and simply setting our mind on the spirit by calling, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our mind is neutral, and it straddles between two sides. It can be set on the flesh, or it can be set on the spirit. To set our mind on the flesh is to stand with Satan, and the result is death. To set our mind on the spirit is to stand with the Lord, and the result is life and peace.</p>
<p>We should know that in every situation either God prevails or Satan prevails. Satan and the evil spirits work in every home and in every person. Satan works mostly in the mind. The way that Satan gets to the mind is firstly through the eyes, then through the ears, and then through the mouth, all of which are connected to the mind. Many times we need to close our eyes and not see anything, cover our ears and not hear anything, shut our mouth and not speak anything, and simply call, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; If we do this, we will be delivered. If a wife gives her husband a long face, he should not look at her. He should simply call, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen.&rdquo; If his wife is being unreasonable, he should not listen to her. He should just declare, &ldquo;O Lord! Victory, victory, hallelujah!&rdquo; In such a situation he should not use his mouth to talk to his wife; rather, he should use it to open himself to the Lord. If he does this, Satan will not be able to do anything to him.</p>
<p>We must set our mind on the spirit. This is a very effective secret, but we do not use it enough. After reading this message, you all should be very clear, but tomorrow morning when your wife gives you a long face, you may forget everything. If you continue to look at her long face with your eyes and listen to her grumbling with your ears, you will fall into Satan&rsquo;s trap. Do not look or listen. Simply set your mind on the spirit by shouting, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do we have the Lord? We do. Is He our Lord? He is. Is He within us? He is in our spirit. For this we must praise the Lord. Praise the Lord that He is in our spirit! The Lord in our spirit is the key. We should not listen to the old talk in Christianity which says that we should look to the Lord who is in heaven. If we really experience the Lord, we will realize that even though it is true that He is in the heavens, it is even more true that He is within us. Thus, we do not need to try so hard to look to Him in the heavens; we only need to turn inward to our spirit. How do we do this? To turn to our spirit is very simple. All we need to do is to call, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; Do we need patience? If we do, we do not need to wait for the Lord, looking to Him for patience. Do we want to love our wife? If we do, we may look to the Lord to give us love, knowing that we cannot love our wife and that only the Lord can cause us to love her. However, this is too objective. In our practical experience, we do not need to be so complicated. Actually, all that we need to do is to call &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; a few times. We do not need to spend time looking to heaven. The Lord Jesus is like heavenly electricity that has been directly connected to our inner being. The Lord is already in our spirit today. To instantly enjoy Him, we only need to turn to our spirit by setting our mind on the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE MIND</h2>
<p>If we continually set our mind on the spirit, the spirit will have the opportunity to spread outward into our mind, saturating our mind and becoming the spirit of our mind. Initially, the spirit is limited within the spirit, but by spreading into our mind, the spirit becomes the spirit of our mind. This causes us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23). The old is replaced by the new. When the spirit of our mind saturates our entire being, all of our thoughts, feelings, and concepts will be completely changed. The old man will be put off and the new man will be put on. In addition, we will be fully transformed from glory to glory into the image of the Lord.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us and grace us, so that we will be able to go on in this way. May we all release our spirit and exercise our spirit. May we set our mind on the spirit so that our spirit will be released, freed, and uplifted, and so that our spirit will spread into our entire being, fully transforming us into a man of the new creation who lives in the Body and in the church. The new man is actually the Body of Christ. Thus, to put on the new man is to put on the church, which is just to live the church life.</p></body></html>
