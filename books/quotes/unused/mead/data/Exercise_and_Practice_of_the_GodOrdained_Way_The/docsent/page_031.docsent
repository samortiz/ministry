   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE NINE MUCH FRUIT AND REMAINING FRUIT Scripture Reading: John 15:5, 8, 16; 1 Thes 2:19-20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: O Lord, we come back to You again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We believe we have been gathered by You into Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, we have seen Your beauty and have been captivated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We love You, so we love the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we love You, we have an interest in the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, You loved the world and came here to save the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also would have this same love and burden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We look unto You for this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, attract us that we may run after You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, defeat the enemy and rescue us from his usurping hand and from the deceiving world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, we are here because You have been with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know You, and we love You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>PASSING THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION TO BEAR MUCH FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this message I will continue to share concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 15:5 the Lord says, "I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must pay close attention to the words "much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here the Lord does not refer just to fruit but much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To bear only fruit is not adequate; we must bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 8 the Lord says, "In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To bear one fruit is not sufficient to glorify, or express, the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To express the Father, to glorify Him, we must bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This can be illustrated by a carnation plant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before it blossoms, its beauty, its glory, is not expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when it blossoms, the carnation is glorified, and its beauty is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, all the opposing ones despised Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was put to death, but after three days He rose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In resurrection, He appeared to Mary at the tomb and said, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through His death and in His resurrection, He was glorified; and in the Son's glorification, the Father was also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His death and resurrection, He bore much fruit; He brought forth His disciples as His many brothers to express and glorify the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, by choosing us and appointing us, He is sending us to go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet, to bear fruit requires the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus went through this process; He cut the way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we should follow Him by letting ourselves be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel in a natural way; instead, we need to pass through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we hear about knocking on people's doors for gospel preaching, we may consider that this is something easy or common and that anyone can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we keep going out to visit people week after week, we will eventually have to pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To go out just once or twice, or even thirty or forty times, will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A fruit tree that bears much fruit has gone through many dealings and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not a simple or easy thing to go out to knock on people's doors and tell them about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, it is easy for a tree to bear fruit because the life within it produces fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, a tree can only produce fruit once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For you to go out to knock on people's doors for the gospel for three months might be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But for you to go out consistently for years might exhaust you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not believe the Lord would charge you to go out every day; once a week would be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Also, you do not need to go out every month; ten months a year would be adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may go out for five months and then rest for one month.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you could go out again for five months.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do this consistently, eventually you might get tired out and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To bear fruit is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why the Lord compares our preaching of Him to fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Preaching is easy; but bearing fruit is not that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should keep going out to preach the gospel for a complete year regardless of whether we bear fruit or not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may go out for five months in the first half of the year and gain no one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then in the second half of the year, after going out for four and a half months and gaining no one, we may feel hopeless and give up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may say: "This way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have been wasting my time."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have seen this happen many times.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I was saved in the spring of 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That year I began to go to the countryside with tracts that I had written by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I did this again and again, yet I gained no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then my patience and endurance came to an end, and I simply gave up.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have encouraged you to go out to visit people and to find many different ways to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But what will you do if you go out for a whole year and still gain no fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am afraid you may stay home and stop going out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You may lose your interest and confidence and say, "This way does not work."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, if you go out for one year and gain nothing and still go out the next year, I am quite sure you will gain some fruit in the second year.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even if you would not gain anything the second year, you still have to go out for a third year.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am very concerned that some of you may become disappointed and stop going out.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I do not expect that you will gain one person every year, but I expect and have the full assurance that within three years you will gain at least one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If everyone will gain one within three years, we will have a thirty-three percent increase each year.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that if we have ninety meeting together, after one year they will increase to one hundred twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then after another year, this one hundred twenty will increase to one hundred sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to Christian history, there has never been a church that has had a thirty-three percent increase every year.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This may seem slow, but for each of us to gain one person every three years is really quite fast.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we do this for ten years, we will have the highest rate of increase in all of Christian history.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If a church of two hundred fifty would increase by one-third each year, the entire population of the earth would be gained in less than sixty years.</S>
