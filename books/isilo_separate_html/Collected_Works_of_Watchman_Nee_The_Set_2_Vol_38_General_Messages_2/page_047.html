A word may pass from one man to another and then to a third and so on. Three or four mouths will turn the word into something totally different from what it was originally. This is because everyone wants to add his own thoughts. When one adds a little and another adds a little more, the whole thing eventually becomes completely distorted. When one person conveys something to another and does not speak according to the facts, adding some of his own thoughts into the speaking, he is lying. Therefore, when we report something, we have to learn to speak before the Lord according to the facts and not put in our own thoughts. If we want to speak our own thoughts, we should clarify that this is our opinion. We should separate our opinions from the facts and not mix them together. Otherwise, we are lying.</p><p>If you want to test a brother's heart before the Lord, all you have to do is tell him something and ask him to pass it on. You can easily find out how his heart is before the Lord. A person who fears the Lord, who has learned the lesson, and who has been dealt with by the Lord considers speaking to be a great thing. He will not dare speak rashly or pass on things lightly. He will always try to speak accurately. A person who has never been dealt with by the Lord and who has never been disciplined will pass on words enthusiastically. The way he relays the words will expose him as a flippant, vain, and dishonest person. As he passes words around, he adds his own words and says many things that should not be said. This kind of person can never preach God's Word. He cannot study the Bible properly, because God's Word is accurate to the last iota and serif (Matt. 5:18). A person who is careless will surely make mistakes concerning God's Word.</p><h2 class="head2">Exaggerations</h2><p>Another common lie is exaggeration. Exaggerations are manifested in inaccurate numbers or in the use of exaggerated words or expressions that are not true. These are lies. Sometimes a person likes to magnify the mistakes of others. A person may be wrong thirty percent, but those who exaggerate will say that it is fifty percent. At the same time these ones try their best to speak lightly of their own mistakes. This is also to lie.</p><p>After a man is saved, his speaking has to be severely disciplined by the Lord before he can become an honest person. Let me say a strong word to all of you: A man must reject lies again and again. Every time there are inaccurate words, he has to reject them. He may need to reject them for three to five years before he can be an honest person. A man who is careless in his speech cannot be honest. A common fault with many people is their lies; they speak inaccurate words. There is no need for a person to learn to lie. As soon as a child is able to talk, he lies. Wise and foolish men alike lie; the only difference is that some are more skillful at lying, while others are less skillful at lying. But whether or not they are skillful, it is lying just the same. Since lying is so common, we have to learn to deal with it. Whenever there is a lie or we touch a spirit of lying, we should be aware of it.</p><h2 class="head1">IDLE WORDS</h2><p>Second, we cannot speak idle words. Matthew 12:35-37 says, "The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things. And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."</p><p>In verse 33 the Lord Jesus says, "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known." Following this, He describes the way man speaks. This proves that the fruit spoken of here is not man's conduct but his words. If the fruit is good, it proves that the tree is good, and if the fruit is bad, it proves that the tree is bad. If a man is good, his words will surely be good, and if a man is evil, his words will surely be evil. Some people gossip, criticize, slander, and tear down others with their words all day long. They say all kinds of unclean, filthy, and evil things. This clearly proves that the tree is bad.</p><p>If God's children have such faults in themselves, it is impossible for them to help others overcome the same faults. If some brothers and sisters spread unhealthy, filthy, or sinful things all the time, there is no need to ask whether the things are true or false; the very spreading is in itself unclean. A man's words are his fruit. One cannot find a man with a pure heart spreading filthy things. Nor can one find a man with a loving heart spreading hate. The fruit proves the tree. This is not a matter of being true or false. A person may be speaking facts, definite facts, but the facts should not have come out of his mouth in the first place. The facts may be true, but they are not words that one should say. The issue is not whether something is true or false but whether or not one should say it. It may not be a lie; it may be a fact, yet as long as it is an idle word, we should not speak it, and we need not speak it.</p><p>The Lord said, "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment" (v. 36). Brothers and sisters, idle words spoken by a Christian are not over once they are spoken; they will be repeated again a second time. Today you may have spoken something rashly. But one day, you will have to say the same thing again before the judgment seat. When you say it the second time, you will be justified or condemned according to your word. Hence, God's children should learn to fear the Lord and reject all inaccurate and idle words. A word that does not edify oneself or others should not be uttered.</p><p>Whether or not a man has been dealt with by the Lord can be seen from the words he speaks. Those who have been dealt with by God have their mouths checked. Those who lie and speak idle, careless words are of little use to the Lord. The only thing they can do is wait for the judgment to come. Those who speak filthy words are surely filthy in themselves. Those who speak corrupting words are surely corrupt in themselves. The kind of words you speak proves the kind of person that you are. One tells the tree by its fruit, and one tells a person by his words. From the day we are saved, we should learn to be dealt with by the Lord in our speaking.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
