Before becoming king, David was also anointed by Samuel, and then he began to serve God according to the ministry which God had bestowed upon him (1 Sam. 16:12-13). This shows us very clearly that ministry follows anointing. A person who has a ministry before God must have first received an anointing before God. This is true even of the Lord Jesus. He said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of jubilee" (Luke 4:18-19). We can see from the Word of God that a person who is useful in the hand of God must have first received the anointing before Him. One who has not received the anointing before God cannot serve or work for Him.</p><p>Having the anointing can very easily become an outward matter among the children of God. We are prone to link the anointing and power together. It is true that they are associated with each other because God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. The Holy Spirit and power do go together, and the Holy Spirit is the power of God, but the Holy Spirit becoming power upon man is just the result of the anointing; this is not God's primary purpose. It is not the thought which God has in mind at the time of anointing people. We should understand that the purpose of receiving the anointing is not to speak with tongues, to perform miracles, or to work wonders. The purpose of the anointing is to be separated and holy before God.</p><p>The anointing is referred to in many instances in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, however, the anointing is not linked together with power. The anointing had only one significance in the Old Testament: to indicate that the person belonged to God. When I say that this book belongs to me, I affix a seal upon it; when God says that a person belongs to Him, He anoints him. Ointment is for separation as well as sanctification. To anoint means to separate unto Jehovah or to belong to Jehovah for holiness.</p><p>This kind of absolute belonging to the Lord constitutes the primary requisite for the ministry. Anyone who has a ministry before God is separated unto Jehovah. Only those separated to Jehovah can have the ministry; only they can participate in the work. Whenever consecration ceases, the work will also cease; whenever there is a change in consecration, there will be a change in the ministry.</p><p>After the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus, God's acknowledgement, "This is My Son, the Beloved" (Matt. 3:17), came before the Lord began to work. This was God's speaking. Therefore, the anointing indicates God's ownership. Here is a person whom God can claim to be His own, and here is someone whom He can send or use. After the anointing we see power, spontaneous power. As a result the gospel was preached to the poor, sight was restored to the blind, those in bondage were delivered, and men heard of the year of jubilee, in which God accepts man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING TO OTHERS&mdash;POWER</h2><p>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power before the Lord Jesus went about doing good and healing those who were oppressed by the devil. God anointed Him with ointment. What is this ointment? It is the Holy Spirit, and it is also power. It is very wonderful and precious that the Holy Spirit is ointment on us and power to others. To others the Holy Spirit is experienced as power, whereas on us, it is ointment. Whenever the ointment is on us, those who come in contact with us will touch power.</p><p>If we are separated before the Lord, spontaneously we will be power to others. Power is not first but second. If the problem of consecration before God is settled, spontaneously the question of power to others is settled. Whenever there is a problem with consecration (or, in other words, with separation), there is a problem with power, and there is a problem with the work. Anointing brings in spontaneous power. This is true with David as well as with Aaron.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
