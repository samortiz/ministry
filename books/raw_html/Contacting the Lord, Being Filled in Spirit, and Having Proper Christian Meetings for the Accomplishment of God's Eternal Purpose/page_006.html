<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DEAL WITH, CONTACT, AND ENJOY<br />
THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>It is wonderful that we have this divine person dwelling within us. The very Triune God of this universe is within us, and He will never leave us. The question now is how to deal with Him. How do we deal with, contact, and enjoy this wonderful One who is dwelling within us? How do we take Him as our life and everything in a practical way in our daily life? The Triune God being within us is not a matter of doctrine; it is very real and practical. Thus, we must consider how we should deal with, contact, and enjoy Him within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Loving Him</h2>
<p>The first thing we must do is love the Lord. In the Gospel of John the Lord did not ask us to do many outward things. Rather, He asked us to do two things&mdash;to believe into Him and to love Him. After He had risen from the dead, the Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; Then the Lord asked Peter two more times, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me?&rdquo; (21:15-17). I believe that the Lord is asking us this question today. Do we love the Lord? It is a pity if we do not love Him. We all must love the Lord. I believe that within every believer there is a longing to love the Lord. Even backsliding believers have this longing and have some love for the Lord within them. We all have such a longing and such a love in our heart. Our love for the Lord may be very small, but even though we may have only a little love for Him in our heart, this is sufficient. This small amount of love is like a seed that will eventually grow. All of us must love the Lord. I have traveled to many places on this earth, and I have observed that every Christian has something within him that is calling and even demanding that he love the Lord. Each of us has such a sense within&mdash;something urging and demanding that we love the Lord. We must take care of this feeling and respond to this inner voice. We need to answer this call and tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I must love You, and I do love You, but my love for You is very small. Cause me to love You more.&rdquo; We all must pray to the Lord concerning our love for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecrating Ourselves to Him</h2>
<p>In addition to loving the Lord, we must consecrate ourselves to Him. At least once in our life we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord in a definite way. We all must pass through this crisis. If we have never consecrated ourselves to the Lord in a definite way, we must do so now. We must go to the Lord and tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I have been bought by You. You have purchased me with Your precious blood, and I have been ransomed and redeemed by You. Lord, I am Yours. I belong to You, so I hand myself over to You. Because I love You, I offer myself to You.&rdquo; Many of us might have done this before, but if some years have passed since the last time we consecrated ourselves to the Lord, we must do it again; we must renew our consecration. After we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, the Lord will have the ground to operate in us. The Lord will have the ground within us, and He will begin to move and speak in us. In addition, we will have the ground to contact the Lord and to enter into fellowship with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reading and Praying the Word in Spirit</h2>
<p>In addition to loving the Lord and consecrating ourselves to Him, we must spend time in His Word. Every morning we must open His Word. We do not need to read too much; we should simply open the Word and read it with our heart and our spirit. We may know how to read the Word with our mind, and we may even know how to read the Word with our heart, but do we know how to read the Word with our spirit? Second Corinthians 3:17 states that the Lord is the Spirit, and John 6:63 reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. To read the Word with our spirit means that when we come to the Word, we need to contact it with the innermost part of our being. We must contact the Word with the deepest part of our being, and we must not merely understand the Word but sense the Word. We must not only understand the Word with our mind and love it with our heart; we must also sense it with our spirit. There is a great difference between reading the Word and reading the newspaper. To read the newspaper, we only need to use our eyes to see the words and our mind to understand them. To properly read the Word, however, requires something more. To properly read the Word, we also need to use our heart to love the Word and our spirit to contact and sense the Word.</p>
<p>This matter of sensing the Word may be unfamiliar to many. Some may wonder what this means and how we can use our spirit to sense the Word. To sense the Word with our spirit requires us not only to read the Word but also to pray over the Word. After reading a verse or two, we need to spend some time to pray with the verses and concerning the verses. For example, suppose we read Luke 18:19, which says, &ldquo;But Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One&mdash;God.&rdquo; After reading this verse, we need to pray about it. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, Your Word says that no one is good. Thus, I am not good. No one is good except God Himself. Lord, I do praise You. You are the only One who is good. There is nothing within me that is good.&rdquo; After praying in this way, we may continue to pray, &ldquo;Lord, since there is no good in me, please save me from trusting in myself, and teach me how to enjoy You and trust in You. You are the only One who is good.&rdquo; By praying with the Word and concerning the Word in this way, we exercise our spirit, and by exercising our spirit in this way, we contact the Lord in the Word. Instead of merely reading the Word with our mind, we can exercise our spirit by praying over the Word. We can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, no one in this universe is good except One&mdash;God. God is the only One who is good.&rdquo; Of course, we need to understand what this verse means, but even more we need to exercise our heart to love this verse and our spirit to contact the Lord in this verse. We should immediately turn our reading into prayer, praying, &ldquo;Lord, this is so wonderful. No one is good, not even me. Only You are good. Lord, I thank You that You are the only One who is good. Cause me to realize that I am not good and that there is nothing within me that is good. Save me from having any confidence in myself and from trusting in myself. Teach me to trust in You, to take You as my life, and to live by You. You are the only One who is good.&rdquo; This is the way to come to the Word&mdash;to turn all our reading into praying. By doing this, we exercise our spirit and contact the Lord in the Word. This is the simplest and most effective way to read the Word.</p>
<p>Every believer should read through the whole Bible in a quick way at least once so as to get an overview. Then, after reading quickly, he should go back and digest every verse in a slow way, verse by verse. The first kind of reading can be likened to going to the supermarket, purchasing a great amount of food, and bringing the food home and storing it. The second kind of reading can be likened to cooking and eating the food little by little every day. Every day we should eat a little food at breakfast, a little at lunch, and a little at dinner. In like manner, every day we need to take a little of the Word into us. If possible, we should rise up every morning and spend some time to contact the Lord by reading His Word in a living way. Every day we should spend ten minutes to come to the Lord early in the morning. In those ten minutes we do not need to read too many verses, nor do we need to think too much about what we are reading. Instead, we should simply read a few verses and pray over them. By taking a little of the Word into us every day, the Word of God will be our food, and we will live by it.</p>
<p>If we pray over the Word every day, we will sense the presence of the Lord and the anointing of the Holy Spirit. In addition, we will learn how to pray from our spirit. In the past we may have prayed solely from our memory or from our mind, but by praying over a few verses every day, we will learn to pray from our spirit. To pray from our spirit is to pray from our inner sense. Instead of merely praying what we have memorized or what we are thinking, we pray according to the sense that is within us. We can illustrate this in the following way. Suppose a certain brother&rsquo;s mother becomes sick. This brother may be concerned about his mother, but when he comes to contact the Lord, he should forget about his mother&rsquo;s sickness. He should forget about everything and simply come to the Lord, praying to the Lord not according to what is in his mind but by using the Word and by praying according to his deep inner sense. He should pray according to his inner feeling, not according to his memory. If he does this, the more he prays, the more he will sense the presence of the Lord. Eventually, while he is in the presence of the Lord, the Lord within him will remind him to pray for his mother. Then, when this brother prays for his mother, his prayer will not be out of his self but out of the Lord who is within him.</p>
<p>By reading the Word and praying to the Lord in this way, we can contact the Lord and be contacted by Him. The Lord can speak many things to us, bring us into His presence, enlighten us, and show us all our weaknesses, faults, and defilements. When He shows us these things, we must confess to Him. Then He will cleanse us with His precious blood and purge our conscience, making it bright and pure. As a result, our conscience will be fully at peace, and our spirit will be living and prevailing. Consequently, we will have the living anointing within us all day long. We will be able to fellowship and converse with the Lord continually, and as we do this, gradually we will be filled with the Lord until our whole being is full of the Holy Spirit. This is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>The sisters know that the best way to cause their children to grow is to feed them. We Christians also grow by feeding. We grow by feeding on the Lord, and we feed on the Lord by reading the Word in a living way and by praying to the Lord with the Word. This is absolutely not a matter of doctrine. If we take this matter as a doctrine, it will not benefit us. Rather than being a doctrine, this word is a direction for us to take and practice. We all should endeavor to practice. Every morning we should try our best to rise up fifteen minutes earlier than we usually do. Then we can use these fifteen minutes to spend some time with the Lord and to read His Word. We can read at least one or two verses and at most nine or ten verses. We can read in a silent way with a sincere heart and pray about what we read. In fact, we can even pray with what we read. Then we should spend some time to pray in a prevailing way according to our inner sense. If we follow these instructions, we will genuinely contact the Lord. It would be wonderful if we had more time, but we should spend at least fifteen minutes to read the Word and pray to the Lord in this way.</p>
<p>If we spend fifteen minutes every morning to contact the Lord in this way, there will be many results. We will experience the infilling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and spiritual gifts, light, life, and power will flow out of us. When children eat well, they experience change and growth every day. However, Christians today remain the same because they are starving spiritually. The majority of Christians merely come to &ldquo;church&rdquo; and sit in the congregation as &ldquo;pew members.&rdquo; From time to time they have the opportunity to pray a little. When they do, they pray according to their environment, situation, and circumstances, or solely from their memory or natural mentality. Most Christians simply do not know how to exercise their spirit. Even when they read the Word, they exercise only their mind, and the result is that they have many peculiar thoughts. The goal of our reading of the Word, however, is not to receive peculiar thoughts but to contact the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is the Spirit, and the Lord is in His Word. Thus, when we pray and read the Word, we do so not to receive knowledge, doctrines, and teachings but to contact the Lord and to be fed by Him. We need to feed on the Lord through the Word and to contact the Lord through prevailing prayer. Then the Lord will speak to us, reveal Himself to us, and bring us into the light, exposing to us our real condition. Then we will know the Lord and ourselves in a real way. We will also experience the Lord, enjoy the Lord, and be filled with Him. This will cause us to grow and will release many positive blessings. If we spend fifteen minutes every day to read the Word and contact the Lord, after a few weeks even the meetings of the church will be changed. They will become rich, powerful, strong, and living, and in such an atmosphere many sinners will be brought to the Lord. The secret, the key, to all these wonderful things is to contact the Lord through reading the Word and praying in a prevailing way.</p>
<p>In some places that I visit, I ask the brothers to sign their names on a piece of paper, promising that they will spend fifteen minutes with the Lord in the morning. After the brothers who are willing sign this piece of paper, I keep it, and after two weeks I write a letter to each brother asking him whether or not he has kept his promise. Often, brothers have written me back, telling me how wonderful their experience has been. I hope that all of us will make such a decision to spend time with the Lord in the morning to read His Word and to pray to Him in a prevailing way. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I love You, so starting tomorrow I will try to learn to rise up a little earlier in the morning to spend some time with You to read Your Word and to pray in a living, new way.&rdquo; May we all endeavor to enter into this practice.</p>
