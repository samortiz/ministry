First, there is the blood. Christ died for us so that we could escape death; this is for our redemption. Second, there is crucifixion, which deals with the old man. Third, there is the flesh. He was crucified so that man could receive life; through death He released life. Fourth, there is the bearing of the cross. This is for dealing with the self.</p><p>The blood is for forgiveness; crucifixion is for dealing with sin; the flesh is for life; and bearing the cross is for dealing with the self. These aspects of the death of Christ secure a complete salvation for man. Last night we saw how the blood accomplished redemption before God. Tonight we will see how crucifixion deals with sin, that is, how it deals with the indwelling sin. This touches our flesh.</p><h2 class="head1">SINS BEFORE GOD AND SIN WITHIN MAN</h2><p>The Scriptures show us two kinds of sin. One is before God, and the other is in us. The first is plural in the original Greek, while the second is singular. The many sins that are before God are the sins we have committed; they can be counted item by item. The indwelling sin is a kind of power that urges man to sin and to perform many sinful things. We must differentiate between the sins that are before God and the sin that is within man. David said, "Against You and You alone have I sinned" (Psa. 51:4). These are sins before God. However, Paul referred to the "sin that dwells in me" (Rom. 7:20). This sin is another matter. Since there are two aspects of sin in the Scriptures, there must also be two aspects of salvation. The sins before God are dealt with by the blood, while the sin in us is dealt with by another method.</p><p>Let us consider the difference between the sins before God and the sin within man. Suppose a little child does not want to go to bed early. Every night he wants to play until ten o'clock before going to bed. At first his parents do not say much. But as his health continues to deteriorate, his parents decide that he must go to bed at eight o'clock. When eight o'clock comes, he can no longer be outside or play because his parents have given him an order. However, once he enters his bedroom and closes the door, he continues to play until ten o'clock before going to bed. Before his parents gave the order, he was not sinful in their eyes if he did not go to bed on time. But after his parents gave the order, in their eyes he is guilty of the sin of disobedience if he does not go to sleep. This sin issues from the fact that in his heart he does not like to go to sleep. This may continue for a period of time. Every evening the child goes to his room at eight o'clock and plays until ten o'clock. At first his parents are not aware of this. But after awhile, they notice that he is still very tired. So after he goes into his room, the parents watch outside the room and discover that he is still not in bed. The next morning his parents rebuke him, and the child confesses his wrongdoing. His parents forgive him and ask him to go to bed on time again. His sin before his parents is forgiven. But has the heart of the little child changed? Is he going to bed early? After eight o'clock the little child will still sigh and moan in bed because he still does not like to go to sleep.</p><p>Please remember that the forgiveness of sins does not make you a good or sinless person. A proud person may know that pride is sin and may ask God for forgiveness. But forgiveness alone will not necessarily make him humble. This is like a person who habitually borrows money. He keeps on borrowing until he owes millions of dollars. A good friend of his may come along and offer to pay off all the debts. But after his debts are paid off, will he stop borrowing? When the impulse rises up, he will borrow just as before. Although the outward sins are forgiven, the inward sin still remains.</p><p>Temper is a common malady among Christians today. When a Christian loses his temper, he knows he is wrong and he readily asks God for forgiveness. But will he become patient just because God has forgiven him for his temper? He may be patient once, twice, or three times, but eventually he will not be able to contain his temper. Outward sins are forgiven through the Lord's blood, but the inward sin is still a problem. It still requires deliverance, and it still needs to be dealt with. If it is not dealt with, we will end up no better than the worldly people. Even though we are saved and regenerated, we will lose our temper just like an unbeliever. An unbeliever has anxiety, and we also will have anxiety. An unbeliever has pride, and we also will have pride. There will no difference between us and the rest of the world.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
