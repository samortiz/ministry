<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE HOLY BIBLE AND<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT IN A THOROUGH WAY</h2>
<p>God gave us the Holy Bible in our hand because He is the Word, and He imparted the Spirit into our spirit because He is the Spirit. There is one Bible, the Word of God, and there is one Spirit. As Christians, we must deal with the Holy Bible in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. If we do not deal with the Bible in a proper way, we will be foolish and confused concerning God. Similarly, if we do not deal with the Spirit in a proper way, we will be empty and void of God as reality. Without the Word and the Spirit, man would have no relationship with God. If a Christian is to have a rich knowledge concerning God and a thorough understanding of God, he must deal with the Holy Bible in a proper way. He must study it carefully and know it thoroughly. Likewise, if a Christian is to obtain God and enjoy Him richly, he must deal with the Spirit in a proper way. He must contact the Spirit and receive the Spirit. These two matters are complementary, and both are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>John 6:63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This verse connects the Lord&rsquo;s words with the Spirit. The Lord said that it is the Spirit who gives life. Then He went on to say that the words that He speaks to us are spirit. This proves that the Word and the Spirit are two sides of one thing. One side is the Word, and the other side is the Spirit, but they are one and the same. Under normal circumstances every time we touch the Bible, we should touch the Holy Spirit. Every time we read the Bible outwardly, we should touch the Holy Spirit inwardly. Hence, our relationship with the Word is a matter of the Spirit. Colossians 3:16 says that when the Lord&rsquo;s word dwells in us, we will praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Ephesians 5:18-19 says that when the Spirit fills us, we will praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. These verses indicate that the Word that operates in us is a matter of the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>The Spirit and the Word contain all that God is. Whatever is in the Spirit is also in the Word. For example, God being life is related to the Spirit as well as to the Word. Romans refers to the Spirit of God as &ldquo;the Spirit of life&rdquo; (8:2), and the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In Him [the Word] was life&rdquo; (1:4), and &ldquo;the words which I have spoken...are life&rdquo; (6:63). The Spirit is life, and the Word is life. God is also light. This light is surely in the Spirit, because this light is spiritual. This light is also in the Word. Psalm 119 says, &ldquo;The opening of Your words gives light&rdquo; (v. 130), and &ldquo;Your word is a lamp to my feet / And a light to my path&rdquo; (v. 105). The Holy Spirit is light, and the Holy Bible is also light.</p>
<p>God is power. The power of God is in the Holy Spirit and in the word of God. Luke 1:37 says, &ldquo;No word will be impossible with God.&rdquo; The word <em>impossible</em> can also be rendered as <em>powerless.</em> This indicates that God&rsquo;s words are powerful. The power of God is in the Spirit as well as in His Word.</p>
<p>God is our comfort, which is in the Spirit as well as in the Word. When we touch the Holy Spirit, we are comforted, and when we read the Bible, we are also comforted. The Holy Spirit comforts us, and the Holy Bible also comforts us. These examples show that the Word and the Spirit are one; God is the Spirit, and He is the Word. The Spirit is the essence of God, and the Word is the revelation and explanation of God. If there were only the Bible, we could have an understanding of God, but we would be unable to touch God, His essence. We thank the Lord that we not only have the Bible in our hand, but we also have the Holy Spirit in our spirit. As a result, when we read the Bible, the Holy Spirit can move within us. We need to touch the Word, and we also need to touch the Spirit. When we touch both the Word and the Spirit, we also touch God. This point is very crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING THE WORD ENABLING GOD<br />
TO PASS THROUGH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is of little value for us to merely understand the Word of God with our mind. In order for the Word to enter into our spirit so that we can contact God in our spirit, we must pray by turning the Word into prayer. This enables God to pass through our being. The more we pray, the more He will pass through our being; the more thoroughly we pray, the more thoroughly He will pass through our being. When our prayer is detailed and earnest, God can pass through us in a more detailed and earnest way. When we pray a little, God will pass through our being a little. If we pray for a short time, God will pass through our being for a short time. If our prayers are shallow, God will pass through our being in a shallow way. If we pray carelessly, God will not pass through our being in a detailed way&mdash;God cannot be careless, but we do not allow Him to be detailed. The degree and extent of His passing through our being depend on the condition of our prayer. When we contact the Lord&rsquo;s words, in reading the Bible or listening to messages, we must pray thorough prayers in order for God to pass through our spirit in a practical and solid way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;THE LETTER KILLS, BUT THE SPIRIT GIVES LIFE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In conclusion, 2 Corinthians 3:6 says, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&rdquo; This means that if we do not open our spirit and turn the Word into prayer, what we read and hear will only be letters to us and will not profit us. This is the reason that many saints read the Bible and listen to messages but do not have much growth in life.</p>
<p>Some saints know the principles of the Christian life and understand the truth, but this knowledge only becomes the basis for criticizing others. The more they read the Bible and listen to messages, the more critical they are of others, and the more critical they are of others, the deader they become. This proves that the letter kills. If a message is not received with an open spirit and turned into prayer, it will be dead letters in our mind. It is dead knowledge, which kills (1 Cor. 8:1). However, if we learn to open our spirit and pray after reading the Bible or hearing a message, digesting the Word of the Lord in a spirit of prayer, His words will become spirit and life to us. They will swallow up our death, supply our needs, and cause us to live in a fresh and living way before the Lord. The Spirit gives life. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p>
