	 <h2 class="head2">Everyone Functioning and<br />
Bearing the Responsibility Faithfully</h2>
<p>The arrangement of the small groups allows everyone to function according to his or her measure. A small group gathering removes every excuse for not functioning. Every small group gathering is a &ldquo;playground&rdquo; for playing ball. As long as there is a playground, no one has an excuse. In the past some may have felt that there was no place to exercise their function. But now one huge playground has become four hundred small playgrounds. There are small playgrounds near every saint. There is no excuse for not playing, but when we play, we should neither overvalue or depreciate our function. The most important thing is that everyone function and bear responsibility faithfully.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising Wisdom and Learning Actively</h2>
<p>I would like to speak of my personal experience. During the first three weeks in August of 1933, there was a tremendous struggle within me concerning whether I should drop my job to serve the Lord full time. During this time, Brother Watchman Nee was sailing back from Europe to China. One day while he was praying in his cabin for the work in China, the Lord gave him a sense to write a letter, telling me that I should serve the Lord full time. He sent this letter to the Shanghai Gospel Bookroom, which redirected the letter to me. My decision was a source of great consternation. At this time I had three children, and even though it did not matter to me whether I starved, I had the responsibility for my wife and children. Then I received Brother Nee&rsquo;s letter in which he said, &ldquo;Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.&rdquo; Although the note was short, I was deeply touched. Subsequently, I let go of my job to serve the Lord full time and went to Shanghai in October to see Brother Nee.</p>
<p>The co-workers in Shanghai also confirmed my decision to serve full time. When I arrived in Shanghai, everyone I met spoke the Shanghai dialect, whereas I spoke the native dialect of Chefoo in the north. Nevertheless, the co-workers encouraged me to move my family to Shanghai so that I could serve in coordination with them. Later a brother said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are a native of Chefoo, but you are able to come to Shanghai to preach and even work among the Shanghainese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later I came to work in the United States. When I began to give messages, I heard comments that no Chinese preachers had been able to work among Americans except for me. Even though my English was not very good, I was asked about my secret for speaking to Americans. The only secret is to endeavor to learn the particular ways of others. In our learning, we will gain an understanding of their ways that even they may not fully realize. For example, after I arrived in Shanghai, I did not learn much of the Shanghai dialect, but I learned the ways of the Shanghainese. As a result, I could speak convincingly with clear messages that touched the feeling of the Shanghainese.</p>
<p>At the end of May 1961, I began to give messages in English in the United States. After speaking for three years, the Americans said, &ldquo;All those in the church life in the United States speak Mr. Lee&rsquo;s English.&rdquo; Today some American Christian publications also adopt my expressions, such as &ldquo;returning to the spirit.&rdquo; In 1964 the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> published a report about us that was not very accurate. We responded by writing an article to state our standing, and I used the term &ldquo;church practice,&rdquo; realizing that there was no such expression in English. An American brother who taught English said, &ldquo;This is not good English.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;You are right. I know this is not good English, but please tell me what other English words convey this meaning.&rdquo; He thought for a long time but was unable to think of anything; in the end he had to agree with the expression I used.</p>
<p>Not long after that, we published <em>The Stream</em> magazine as well as an English hymnal. For this hymnal I wrote nearly two hundred hymns. There was an American brother who knew music quite well, and he was also very good in poetry. Consequently, he felt that some of my expressions were not very good English. Based on his word, I handed the hymns to him to make corrections. He spent a good amount of time on them, yet he also felt that it was difficult to make corrections. In the end he used many of the original words. Then I told him that literature follows culture. When there is a certain invention in a culture, there will be the need for a new word; that is, there will be the need for an expression to convey the culture&rsquo;s progress. When there are no appropriate words, a word needs to be created. I have had to create new terms because there were no words to express these new developments.</p>
<p>In the past there was not such a thing in Christianity as &ldquo;returning to the spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Returning to the spirit&rdquo; speaks of a new culture; it is a new expression created by us. Several years ago in an institutional publication of a renowned American evangelist, there was an article that even used the term <em>pray-reading.</em> This shows that Christianity also sees a need for new terms. Hence, we should not be conservative; rather, we should endeavor to learn in every aspect. This is the secret of my work. All of us need to learn well.</p>
