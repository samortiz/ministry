   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Do you believe that all the members of the church are wonderful persons?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It seems that the members of the Body, the saved ones, are peculiar people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that according to the flesh, according to the natural man, it is not easy to be together with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unless you learn the lessons, sooner or later, you will drop out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the matter of the church there is no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This requires us to learn how to fear the Lord and deal with our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1926 Brother Watchman Nee started to work in Shanghai to establish the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, in 1942 the enemy raised up a big turmoil in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Nee was put in a position that he could no longer minister there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some of the saints came to Brother Nee, saying, "Brother Nee, let us have another start.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us start another meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee told them, "No. You have to continue going to that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No matter what kind of attitude they have toward you or toward me, you have to go to that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither you nor I have the right to start another thing."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the test to the self, to the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the biggest lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today it is very easy for the believers to form meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many believers who are dissatisfied with the so-called traditional church service just meet in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They think everyone has the right to set up a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are too free.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no limitation, no rule.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I once went to a certain city and met with at least three or four free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They all claimed that they were non-sectarian, yet they would not come together to be one with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every group keeps itself independent, separate, from the others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Strictly speaking, this is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no regulation, no rule.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not be legalistic, but we should not be too liberal either.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be governed, ruled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The proper governing rule or principle is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose there are some brothers in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They start to meet in the name of the Lord on the proper ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I go to their city, I have no right to set up another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have to keep the oneness with them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Right away, however, I am put on the test because human beings always like to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I had started the meeting there, I might have been number one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But now that I come here to meet with them, I would be number two.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone likes to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because I do not want to be the second but the first, I would not submit to their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, I would set up another meeting so that I may be a little king.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there is not the grace and the lesson of the cross, everyone of us would be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But here is the test.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are going to keep the oneness of the Body, we do not have a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are many lessons for us to learn in order to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Look at today's situation among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are divisions after divisions because of the flesh, the self, and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are the state churches and the denominational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Following this, there is the Brethren practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then today there are so many free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today the practice of the free groups is fashionable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They say that they are really free from the denominational system, but the divisions created by the free groups are endless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I do not agree with you who are meeting on Twenty-third Street, I will set up a meeting on Twenty-fifth Street.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I am not satisfied with the meeting that is in your home, I will set up a meeting in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is too free.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The free groups simply neglect the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to honor this ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you think there is a proper reason for you to separate yourself from other Christians meeting in the Lord's name on the ground of oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No reason is proper, and no reason is valid.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as you live in Israel, you have to go together with all of Israel to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have no choice but to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you would not do it, that means you break the law and you have become lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose you and another Israelite are enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You and he, according to the law, have to go to the same place three times a year to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a real test.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, you have to forgive him, and he has to forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have to learn how to be happy with him by the Lord's grace, and he has to learn to be happy with you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You have to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I believe this is clear to all of us.</S>
