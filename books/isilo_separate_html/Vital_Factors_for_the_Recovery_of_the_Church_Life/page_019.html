<p>Although the administration of the church is separate and equal locally, the fellowship of the church is one universally. In fellowship there is no separation. On this entire earth there is only one fellowship, and this fellowship is universally one. The fellowship of the church is one not merely in a particular nation, but in the entire universe. There is not one fellowship in England, another fellowship in the United States, another fellowship in Germany, another fellowship in China, and another fellowship in Japan. In these nations there are separate churches in many cities, but there is only one fellowship in the entire universe.</p>
<p>This fellowship is called the fellowship of the apostles. Acts 2:42 says that the three thousand who believed in the Lord Jesus and became the members of the church on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. In the church both the fellowship and the teaching should be one universally. In all the churches we should only teach one thing&mdash;Jesus Christ as the Spirit to be our life for the producing of the church. This is the teaching of the apostles. If a different teaching comes in, we must reject it (1 Tim. 1:3-4). We accept only one kind of teaching, the teaching of the apostles, and have only one fellowship, the apostles&rsquo; fellowship.</p>
<p>In the early days all the believers continued in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship. This fellowship of the apostles is with the Father and with the Son. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The apostles&rsquo; fellowship is with the Father and with the Son. This means that it is with the Triune God. Around the globe there is only one Christian fellowship&mdash;the fellowship of the apostles with the Triune God.</p>
<p>This fellowship is expressed at the Lord&rsquo;s table. When we eat the bread we participate in the fellowship of the body of Christ, and when we drink the cup we participate in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s blood (1 Cor. 10:16). The Lord&rsquo;s body and blood are unique, and the fellowship of Christ&rsquo;s body and blood is also unique. By partaking of the one bread, we have become the mystical Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). Therefore, this universal fellowship is the fellowship of the Body of Christ. It is the fellowship passed on to us by the apostles. Hence, it is the apostles&rsquo; fellowship, and this fellowship is with the Triune God. Such a fellowship must be universal. In administration the churches are separate locally, but in fellowship they are united to be one universally.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLESHIP AND THE ELDERSHIP</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostleship Being Universal<br />
and Being over the Eldership</h2>
<p>The apostleship is universal. When Paul and Barnabas were in the church at Antioch they were not apostles, but prophets and teachers (Acts 13:1). However, when they went out to preach the gospel to establish the churches, they were the sent ones. A sent one is simply an apostle. They were prophets and teachers in the local church in Antioch, but by being sent out in the ministry they became apostles to establish the churches.</p>
<p>Since it is the apostles who appoint the elders, the apostles are above the elders (Acts 14:23). Because all the elders in the local churches are established and appointed by the apostles, the apostles are over the elders.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Eldership Being Local<br />
and Being under the Apostleship</h2>
<p>The eldership is local, and it is under the apostleship. First Timothy 5:19-20 indicates that an accusation against an elder should be made to the apostles. This shows that the elders are under the apostles.</p>
<p>The government of the church is very simple. The apostles go out and preach the gospel to establish the churches. Then they select the more mature believers and appoint them to be elders to shepherd, to take care of, a local church. The elders should take care of the churches according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Because all the churches are established by the apostles, and the elders are selected and appointed in different localities by the apostles, in taking care of the churches all the elders should take the word of the apostles.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
