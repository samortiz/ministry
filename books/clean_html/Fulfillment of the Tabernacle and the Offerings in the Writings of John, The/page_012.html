<h2 class=head2>C. Not Only Conciliatory but Also All-inclusive</h2><p>John’s writings are not only conciliatory but also all-inclusive. The word conciliatory means reconciling. Some theologians say that John’s writings are conciliatory in reconciling doctrinal controversies concerning Christ’s Person. One school of thought claimed that Christ was divine but not human. Of course, this is heretical. According to 1 John 4, some spirits do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is to deny the fact that Christ is human as well as divine. Another school of thought claimed that Christ was human and not divine, that He was merely a good man but not God. According to this heretical school, after His resurrection Christ became divine. John reconciled these matters when he said that the Word is God and that the Word became flesh (John 1:1, 14). The Word is divine, even God Himself. The “flesh” in John 1:14 denotes humanity. Therefore, in these verses John shows that Christ is both God and man, both divine and human.<p>We would prefer to say that John’s writings are not merely conciliatory but all-inclusive. The writings of John are all-inclusive in the truth of Christ being all in all. Those who do not see Christ’s all-inclusiveness can be compared to blind men touching different parts of an elephant. Some touch the trunk, and others touch the legs, the side, or the tail. But all think that they have a full understanding of what an elephant is. Instead of trying to reconcile the differences among these blind men, John would speak concerning the entire elephant. It is a kind of blindness to deny any aspect of Christ’s all-inclusiveness.<p>Christ is both God and man, both the Creator and a creature. Years ago, certain ones declared, “Our Christ is the Creator, but He is not a creature.” When I heard this, I said to myself, “It is foolish to say that Christ is not a creature, but that He is only the Creator. If Christ were not a creature as well as the Creator, how could He be a man with a body of flesh, blood, and bones? Are these not the elements of a creature?” Because of the heretical teaching of Arius, who was condemned at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325, some are not willing to say that Christ is a creature as well as the Creator. (Arius falsely taught that Christ was merely a created being, not the very God Himself.) According to the Bible, our Christ is all-inclusive. Because He is God, He is the Creator. But because He is also a man, He is a creature with a body made up of created elements.<p>If Christ were not a creature, how could He have had the blood to shed for our sins? The divine Being does not have the blood required for our redemption. Because we are human beings, we need human blood to be shed for us. The redemption accomplished through the blood of Jesus gives us eternal salvation. This blood has eternal efficacy. First John 1:7 speaks of the blood of Jesus, the Son of God. The name Jesus denotes the Lord’s humanity; the title Son of God denotes His divinity. It is the blood of Jesus that redeems us, and it is the divinity of the Son of God that insures the eternal efficacy of this redeeming blood. If Christ were only divine, He would not have had the blood to shed for us. But because He is both human and divine, both a creature and the Creator, He had the blood to shed for our redemption.<p>John’s writings reveal the truth of Christ being all in all. Christ is God, man, the Creator, the creature, and even our spiritual food, water, and air. Because we teach the all-inclusiveness of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John, others have falsely accused us of teaching pantheism, the heretical doctrine that everything in the universe is God. Those who condemn us falsely for teaching pantheism say, “Witness Lee teaches that grass, water, air, sunshine, and wind are all God. He claims that everything in creation is divine. Therefore, he is pantheistic in his teaching. We know that he came from the Orient, and that oriental people are pantheistic.” This is their accusation, but I strongly declare that I am not pantheistic. According to the Scriptures, I teach that Christ is all-inclusive. My Christ is God and man, the Creator and a creature. Christ is my Redeemer, my Savior, my Master, my Lord, and the life-giving Spirit. He is the real life, light, spiritual food, water, and air. Christ is even my spiritual clothing. Oh, He is everything to me! Is this pantheism? Certainly not! This is the truth of Christ’s all-inclusiveness revealed in the writings of the New Testament.
