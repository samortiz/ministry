   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Showing Them That They Have Been Saved</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Besides showing people forgiveness of sins, justification by faith, and eternal life, we need to show them verses that tell them they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The best verses for this are Romans 10:9 and 10, which say, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, verse 13 says, "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may also use Acts 16:31: "And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must stress these four main points from the Word: they are forgiven, they are justified, they have received eternal life, and they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can give them more, but these four items are very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot do too much by one contact alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After preaching to them, we may only do the first thing, that is, help them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the very next day we may go to contact them again to help them realize that the Lord Christ is the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps then there will be time to help them with these practical verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not have enough time, we can leave something for the third contact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not try to do everything at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Helping People to Know the Body</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen three main items related to helping people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must help them to pray to "close the deal"; we must help them to realize that Christ is the living Spirit, that they have to receive Him by opening their heart and their spirit; and we need to help them with some practical verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should also help people to know that they are saved by the Lord through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have to realize their relationship to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the very beginning we have to help the new believers to know the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They will never forget what they are impressed with at the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to explain to them that from this time on they need to come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have to come to contact the brothers and to have fellowship with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When someone is saved through us, we should immediately help him to realize the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we should recommend two or three brothers or sisters as their new companions in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will be a great help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every new believer, every new convert, will have at least two or three brothers as Christian companions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all have to learn to help people in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a meeting for preaching the gospel, we should ask the new believers to come for three nights of follow up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way we can immediately give them some training.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think, though, that these are their meetings, so we should not come.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, it is our turn to come to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then after this follow-up work, we can baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the following Lord's Day, we will have a good number of new believers in the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These will be the "new folks" in our family.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we can help them to know a little bit about the church, and they will realize that the church, the Body, is their home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should also help them to know that we do not preach the gospel individualistically; we preach the gospel in a Body way, a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the first day they should know that this is the church preaching the gospel, not to bring people to heaven, but to bring people to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to believe that after only two weeks they will bring many people to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They will function even better than we do.</S>
