   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO HOW GOD DEALS WITH THE BELIEVERS' SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DISCIPLINE IN THE KINGDOM 1 SUFFERING GOD'S DISCIPLINE IN THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible tells us that the Lord disciplines us because He loves us Heb 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When man loves, he overlooks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when God loves, He disciplines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When man loves, he is loose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when God loves, He is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If God had not loved us, He would not have sent His Son to die for our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Similarly, if God does not love us, He would not discipline us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's disciplining love is the same as His saving love, which caused Him to send His Son to die for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was His love that caused His Son to die on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is also His love that disciplines us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every Christian knows that there is no contradiction between God's discipline and God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, God's discipline manifests God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we have seen that a man cannot perish again after he is saved, we can never say that such a one will never suffer God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the question is whether God's discipline is confined to this age or whether it will be found in the coming age as well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a question that many people have never considered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will take a look at this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible shows us that God's discipline is not restricted to this age only.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is also found in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people have confined God's discipline to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But you cannot find the basis for such a teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In terms of the experience of Christians, there is surely the possibility for discipline in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many have not been disciplined in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although they are God's children, they have not lived a consecrated life in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do whatever they want and do many things in disobedience throughout their lives and until their death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although some have been zealous for the Lord and have worked and have even experienced many miracles and works of power outwardly, these things are all done according to their own will and contrary to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some even have obvious sins and specific transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we do not see much discipline in these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, they live peacefully and depart from this world in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, in addition to losing the reward, these people will be disciplined in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will experience specific discipline from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, experientially speaking, if a Christian lives on earth today without checking his lust and instead loves the world and walks in his own ways, he will be disciplined in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have ample evidence of this from the Bible.</S>
