<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the process and issue of man&rsquo;s first fall. Although the issue of man&rsquo;s fall was pitiful, the Bible does not stop there. When there was no way out for man and he was despondent, God came in. When God comes in, there is a way out. Because of His love for man, God prepared a way of salvation to deal with man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WAY OF SALVATION TO DEAL WITH MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking Man</h2>
<p>The first step in God&rsquo;s dealing with man&rsquo;s fall was to seek man. After the fall Adam and Eve felt ashamed and were afraid of God, and they &ldquo;hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden&rdquo; (Gen. 3:8). However, God came to seek them. After the fall, in God&rsquo;s first words to Adam, He asked, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; (v. 9). What a great gospel! After man&rsquo;s fall God&rsquo;s first words to man were the gospel: &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; When we are in sin, corruption, or death, God comes to ask, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; This shows that God is seeking man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Judging the Serpent</h2>
<p>The second step in God&rsquo;s dealing with man&rsquo;s fall was to judge the serpent by cursing him (v. 14). This curse includes two things. First, God cursed the serpent, making him to go on his stomach. This means that the realm of the serpent&rsquo;s activities would be limited; he would be allowed only to creep on the earth. According to this account, the serpent did not go on his stomach until he was cursed by God. This is symbolic and meaningful. After man fell because of Satan&rsquo;s temptation, God cursed and judged Satan, limiting the realm of his activity to the earth. Those who understand spiritual warfare know that when we fall and become earthly and worldly, we enter the realm in which Satan works. However, when our spirit is uplifted, transcendent, and in the heavenly realm, Satan has no influence over us.</p>
<p>Second, God cursed the serpent so that he would eat dust all the days of his life (v. 14). This is another limitation because it limited the type of food that the serpent could eat. First Peter 5:8 says that Satan &ldquo;walks about, seeking someone to devour.&rdquo; The kind of person who is a target for Satan&rsquo;s devouring is an earthy person. Those who are out of Adam are earthy, and such ones are the target of Satan&rsquo;s devouring (1 Cor. 15:47). After Satan was cursed, God limited him to eating dust. In terms of spiritual symbolism, when we live by the life of the old creation, that is, by our flesh and our natural life, we are earthy, and we become food for Satan to devour. But when we are spiritual and heavenly, we are delivered from the realm of Satan&rsquo;s devouring.</p>
<p>Although creeping on the earth and eating dust are limitations to Satan, they are also a dealing to man. Because man fell and became earthy, Satan is able to work in man and to devour man. However, God came to save man and to deal with man&rsquo;s fall by limiting Satan to move only on the earth and to eat only dust as his food. When a person is saved, he is delivered from the earth to the heavenlies (Eph. 1:3) and out of dust to the spirit; that is, he is delivered out of the realm of Satan. God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan is also a way of dealing with man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROMISE OF THE SEED OF THE WOMAN</h2>
<p>When God judged the serpent, He spoke a promise, saying, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel&rdquo; (Gen. 3:15). This important verse in the Bible includes four crucial phrases: <em>I will put enmity between you and the woman; between your seed and her seed; he will bruise you on the head;</em> and <em>you will bruise him on the heel.</em> These four phrases are very significant and present contrasts. The first contrast is between <em>you</em> and <em>the woman,</em> the second is between <em>your seed</em> and <em>her seed,</em> and the third is between <em>he will bruise you on the head</em> and <em>you will bruise him on the heel.</em></p>
<p>After being damaged by the serpent, Adam and Eve saw their shame. When God came to seek them, they hated the serpent who had ensnared them, but they were also afraid that God would punish them. They thought that they would surely die after eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, they must have been in fear and trembling, awaiting God&rsquo;s punishment. This was the background of God&rsquo;s giving them the promise. When God came, He first cursed and judged the serpent, but in this judgment God brought His promise and grace to man.</p>
<p>God said to the serpent, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel&rdquo; (v. 15). This word was pleasant to Eve&rsquo;s ear. God had charged Adam and Eve not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that they ate of it they would surely die (2:17). Because they had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge, they were deserving of death. In this state of fear, God spoke of enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman. The phrase <em>her seed,</em> &ldquo;the seed of the woman,&rdquo; conveys the light of life, the gospel of life. How could there be a seed if the woman died? For the woman to have a seed meant that the woman would not die. When Eve understood the meaning of God&rsquo;s word, she might have praised Him, saying, &ldquo;I will not die, because I will have a seed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>God also said to the serpent that the seed of the woman would bruise him on the head. By this time Eve should have been clear that although she hated the serpent, she had no way to deal with him. However, she would have a seed who would bruise the serpent on the head. The vital part of a serpent is its head. When a serpent&rsquo;s head is bruised, it is killed. Hence, Eve must have been very happy, because someone would come to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head. Nevertheless, the serpent would bruise the heel of the seed of the woman. Although this bruise would be painful, it would not be fatal. These four points speak of God&rsquo;s promise to man. This promise was revealed in God&rsquo;s word of judgment upon Satan.</p>
<p>Genesis 3:15 contains the first promise in the Bible. The content of this promise is rich and significant. It shows Satan&rsquo;s work throughout the ages among the children of God, and it shows the Lord Jesus&rsquo; annulling of Satan&rsquo;s work. This is the first promise regarding the Lord Jesus as the seed of the woman bruising the serpent&rsquo;s head. Genesis 3:15 is the first promise in the Bible that refers to the Lord Jesus and His work on the cross. Therefore, this promise occupies a crucial place in the Bible. This fact has been acknowledged by Bible expositors throughout the ages. In order to expound this promise, we need to know the record of the entire Bible, because this promise encompasses everything from Genesis 3 to the end of Revelation.</p>
