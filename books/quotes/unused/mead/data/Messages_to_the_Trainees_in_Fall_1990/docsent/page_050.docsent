   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. DIVISION BEING HERETICAL, SECTARIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Division is versus oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order for us to practice the oneness of the Body of Christ, we need to realize that division is heretical, sectarian Gal 5:20b-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see the real meaning of the word heresy in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some of us may feel that heresy is anything against the truth revealed in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians teach and practice differently in things such as foot-washing, baptism, and head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the word heresy is used to refer to only two things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, any teaching that denies the person of Christ in His divinity as God or in His humanity as man is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, the word heresy also refers to division.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Galatians 5:19-21a says, "And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, angers, faction, divisions, parties, envyings, drunkenness, carousings..."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Galatians 5:20 the Greek word for "parties," hairesis, is literally heresies, which means schools of opinions Darby's New Translation , sects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A sect is a party, and a party is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Divisions and parties, sects, are works of the flesh, and "those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God" v. 21b . Second Peter 2:1 uses the word hairesis in referring to false teachers who bring in destructive heresies, denying the Master who bought them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Titus 3:10 uses the same Greek word for heresy in its adjectival form, hairetikon, in referring to a factious man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Denying the person of Christ in His divinity and humanity and division are the only two items that can be considered as heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wrong teachings apart from division and heresy cannot be considered heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A wrong teaching, such as baptism by sprinkling instead of immersion, cannot be considered heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is because such wrong teachings do not affect the seven factors of our Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some who practice baptism in a different way than immersion still have God as their Father and Jesus Christ as their Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They still have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have the same hope and the genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They also believe that baptism separates people, so they have the significance of the one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The forms that we practice may differ, but the significance remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Denying the person of Christ and division are the only two items that can be considered as heretical because they are damaging to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Denying the person of Christ insults Christ as the Head and denies Him as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Division dismembers the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One heresy damages the Head, and the other heresy damages the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These heresies are intolerable in the eyes of God and should be utterly rejected by us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second John says that if anyone denies the Lord's person in His divinity or humanity, we should not receive him into our home or even greet him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>7, 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we either receive him into our home or greet him, we share in his evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regarding the divisive ones, Paul strongly charges us to "turn away from them" Rom 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A. Dismembering the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we have seen, division is so serious, condemned as being heretical, because it dismembers the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. Repulsive in the Eyes of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Division is also repulsive in the eyes of the apostles 1 Cor 1:10-13a; 3:3-4; 11:17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 Corinthians 11:17-20 Paul condemned the Corinthians for coming together for the worse, because there were divisions and parties among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul even said that because some were partaking of the Lord's table in division and with a divisive spirit, they were weak and sick, and some had even died vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>27-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was God's discipline and the Lord's judgment upon them for meeting in division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>C. As Heresies Denying the Person of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>in His Divinity or in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The apostles were also strong in condemning the heresies denying the person of Christ in His divinity or in His humanity 1 John 2:22; 4:2-4; 2 John 7, 9-11; 2 Pet 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1 John 2:22 John was fighting against the heresy of Cerinthus, who denied the divinity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then in 1 John 4:2-4 he was warning against the heresy of the Docetists, who denied the Lord's humanity.</S>
