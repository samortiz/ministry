We want to see the portions in the New Testament revealing the Divine Trinity in the divine move and in our experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EPHESIANS 1:3</H2><P>Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ [the Son], who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing [blessing of the Spirit] in the heavenlies in Christ [the Son]." Ephesians 1:3 is a leading portion of the Word concerning the revelation of the Divine Trinity. This verse reveals the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In this verse the Father is the source of the divine blessing to us.</P><P>Then the Spirit is the nature and essence of the divine blessing. The divine blessing we have received is of a spiritual nature and a spiritual source. The divine Father is the source of this blessing, while the divine Spirit is the nature and the essence of this divine blessing we have received.</P><P>Third, the Son is the sphere, the element, and the means of the divine blessing. Within the sphere of the Son, God gave us His divine blessing. Christ is also the element of the divine blessing. An element is a substance, and every substance has its essence with its nature. Wood, for example, is an element. In this element are a nature and an essence. The nature and essence of the divine blessing are of the Spirit, but the very element of this blessing is Christ Himself. When we say that Christ is the element of God's blessing, we are saying that Christ Himself is the divine blessing. In this divine blessing are the spiritual nature and the spiritual essence. Christ, the Son Himself, is the blessing, the Spirit is the nature and essence of this blessing, and the Father is the source who gives this blessing.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
