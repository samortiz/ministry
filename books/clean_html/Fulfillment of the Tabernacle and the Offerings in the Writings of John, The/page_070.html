<h2 class=head2>Caring for Regulations instead of Enjoyment</h2><p>In their reading of the Bible, the majority of Christians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord by feeding on Him. Instead, they see laws, regulations, ordinances, ceremonies, rituals, forms, and practices. For example, in his reading of Ephesians 5 a brother may pay attention to Paul’s word about husbands loving their wives. Likewise, a sister may pay attention to the requirement that wives should be subject to their husbands. In both cases, Paul’s word in this chapter is taken as a regulation. The brother and the sister reading the book of Ephesians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord.<p>In John 5 all religious things are annulled. Not only are the things in the secular world annulled, but even all the things in the religious world are annulled. Consider chapter five and ask what religious thing has not been annulled. Everything, including the holy city, has been annulled. Moreover, according to this chapter, not even the holy Scriptures can give life apart from Christ.<h2 class=head2>God’s Desire That We Take Him as the Tree of Life</h2><p>Chapter six indicates that we need food. Our unique need according to this chapter is for Christ as our food. After God created man, He particularly charged him to take care of his eating. Concerning man’s eating, God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat” (Gen. 1:29). The Lord also gave man a strict command concerning his eating: “And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it” (Gen. 2:16-17a). God’s desire was that man would take Him as food, as signified by the tree of life. Genesis 2:9 says, “And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden.…” After creating man, God was concerned for man’s eating. In particular, God’s desire was that man would partake of Him as the tree of life.<h2 class=head1>FIVE BARLEY LOAVES AND TWO FISHES</h2><p>In chapter six of John we have the fulfillment of the eating of the tree of life. In this chapter the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five barley loaves and two fishes. In The All-inclusive Christ we point out that the significance of barley is different from that of wheat. Wheat signifies the incarnated Christ, and barley signifies the resurrected Christ. The number five signifies responsibility. Therefore, the five barley loaves here signify the resurrected Christ who is able to bear responsibility.<p>Barley, of course, is of the plant life. In typology, the plant life is for generating, for producing. The two fishes are of the animal life and signify the redeeming aspect of Christ’s life.<p>The barley loaves of the plant life signify the generating aspect of Christ’s life, and the fishes signify the redeeming aspect of His life. As the generating life, Christ grew on the land, on the God-created earth. As the redeeming life, He lived in the sea, the Satan-corrupted earth. In order to regenerate us, He grew on the God-created earth for producing life. But in order to redeem us, He lived in the satanic and sinful world. Just as fish can live in salty water but are not salty, so Christ could live in the sinful world without being sinful and without being affected by the world. In His redeeming life, as typified by the two fishes, Christ lived a victorious life in the “death water” of the sinful world. It is significant, therefore, that the Lord Jesus fed the people with barley loaves and fishes. This indicates that He fed them with the generating life and the redeeming life, the life that overcomes death.
