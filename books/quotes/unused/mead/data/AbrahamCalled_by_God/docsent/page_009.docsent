   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BACKGROUND OF GOD'S CALLING BABEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FORSAKING GOD Now in this message we need to see the experience of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But before we come to this, we need to consider the background and origin of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God appeared to Abraham, he was in the darkest background.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His background was exceedingly strong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first aspect of this background was that man had forsaken God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man's forsaking of God was signified by his building a city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We saw this in the case of Cain in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man built a city because he had lost God as his protection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since man no longer had God as his safeguard, he built a city to protect himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So the building of the city was the sign that man had forsaken God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man seemed to be saying, "Let God go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will build a city to protect myself."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The building of the city was the declaration that man had forsaken God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>EXALTING MAN Not only did man forsake God, but he built a tower to exalt himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tower was a sign of man's self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When man forsakes God, automatically he exalts himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever man builds a city he will also build a tower to make a name for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>DENYING THE RIGHT OF GOD Furthermore, at Babel man also denied God's right over His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both man and the earth were God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, man would not recognize God's right but instead established the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The establishing of nations signified that man had denied God's right and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have seen, after the flood God gave man the authority to rule others, but Satan caused man to abuse this God-given authority to form nations that man may have his own dominion, denying God's right and authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SERVING IDOLS Finally, Joshua 24:2 shows us that at Babel man turned from God to idols, to other gods.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Behind all the idols are demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever a man worships an idol, he worships demons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apparently he is worshipping idols; actually he is worshipping demons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the background of God's calling we have the city, the tower, the nations, and the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man had forsaken God, had exalted himself, had denied God's right and authority, and had turned from God to serve idols.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you believe that the situation is any better today?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is as bad today as it was then.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The situation is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ORIGIN OF GOD'S CALLING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who originated this calling?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham did not originate it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although he was the father of the called race, the calling was not initiated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that Abraham was the same as we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He never dreamed of being called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suddenly, while he and his relatives were there in Chaldea worshipping other gods Josh 24:2 , God appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God was the originator of this calling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE APPEARING OF GOD Although God's calling is carried out in time, something prior to that God's selection took place in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God selected Abraham in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After that, also in eternity past, God predestinated, premarked, Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before Abraham was born, even before the foundation of the world when nothing but God Himself was in existence, God chose Abraham and predestinated him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day, in time, while Abraham was worshipping other gods, having no forethought that he was to be called by God, God visited him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God just came in as the very God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham was surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The God of glory not only came to Abraham, but He appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because Abraham's background was so dark, God had to appear to him in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many of us have also experienced such a strong calling of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I can testify that one day, when I was an ambitious young man, God came to me in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That was God's visitation to me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many of us have experienced the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We were deeply fallen, and light and loose preaching would never have worked in our case.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We needed the living God, the God of glory, to pay us a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have heard many testimonies regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God appeared to Abraham twice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The first time was in Ur of the Chaldees Acts 7:2; Gen 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we study the Bible carefully, we shall see that, in Ur of the Chaldees, God did not appear to Abraham's father but to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Abraham, however, did not accept that calling immediately, and God sovereignly caused his father, Terah, to bring the family from Ur to Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They stayed there until Terah died.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Abraham's staggering in answering God's calling brought about his father's death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God took his father away.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then, at Haran, God appeared to Abraham the second time 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can see by this that God has a specific purpose in dealing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I do not believe that any of you reading this message would respond immediately if God were to visit you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all are the children of Abraham, and children are always like their fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because Abraham hesitated in following God, God had to appear to him the second time.</S>
