<p class="bold">WEEK 13 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 17:8-12</h2><p class="bold">8 &nbsp;And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw <sup>1</sup>no one except Jesus Himself alone.</p> <p class="bold">9 &nbsp;And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.</p> <p>10 &nbsp;And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that <sup>1</sup>Elijah must come first?</p><p class="bold">11 &nbsp;And He answered and said, <sup>1</sup>Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things;</p> <p class="bold">12 &nbsp;But I say to you that <sup>1</sup>Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>8<sup>1</sup> Peter proposed to keep Moses and Elijah, i.e., the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself. The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality; the reality is Christ. Now that Christ, the reality, is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed. No one except Jesus Himself should remain in the New Testament. Jesus is today’s Moses; as such, He imparts the law of life into His believers. Jesus is also today’s Elijah; as such, He speaks for God and speaks forth God within His believers. This is God’s New Testament economy.</p><p>10<sup>1</sup> This was according to Mal. 4:5-6.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> This will be fulfilled at the time of the great tribulation, when Elijah will be one of the two witnesses (Rev. 11:3-4), as prophesied in Mal. 4:5-6.</p><p>12<sup>1</sup> This refers to John the Baptist (v. 13), who came in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:13-17) and was rejected (11:18) and beheaded (14:3-12).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>God took Moses and Elijah away because He would not tolerate seeing His children rank anyone on the same level as His Son Jesus Christ. Therefore, when the disciples saw the Lord Jesus, they saw no one except Him alone. This was a lesson to them.</p><p>As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ. Instead, we need to learn to experience Christ as our Moses and Elijah. He is the One imparting the law of life into us. In other words, as our present, real, subjective Moses He is regulating us from within. Moreover, He is also our present and subjective Elijah, constantly speaking for God and speaking forth God within us. We must listen to Him.</p><p>[In verse 9] we see the principle that the manifestation of the kingdom can be revealed only in resurrection. Anyone who is not in resurrection is not qualified to see it. If we believe in resurrection and live in resurrection, we will be in glory, even though the manifestation of the kingdom has not yet come. When we live and walk in resurrection, we have the sense that we are in glory and that we can see the glorious manifestation of the kingdom. Thus, the manifestation of the kingdom can be revealed only to those in resurrection. For this reason, the Lord Jesus charged the disciples not to talk about His coming in His kingdom.</p><p>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that Elijah would come and restore all things (v. 11). This word indicates that the coming of the kingdom was not yet in full. In the future there will be a full manifestation of the kingdom.…John the Baptist was Elijah, but he was not Elijah in full. The full coming of Elijah will take place in the future.…In the Bible the fulfillment of prophecy is often like this. First there is a partial fulfillment, then the complete fulfillment.…Today we see in Christ’s transfiguration a miniature of the coming manifestation of the kingdom. The miniature assures us that the full manifestation will come.
