   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sins in Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Disposition is related to man s character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is his personal traits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every person is born with a certain disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has not come to deliver us from sin only, but also from our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some are born stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Others are born very legalistic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For them, two plus two must be four.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are very proper, but at the same time, they are very rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What they regard as right is right, and what they regard as wrong is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are very unbending.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wherever they are and whatever they do, they are always the supreme judge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no doubt that they are often very righteous, but their righteousness has horns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They lack gentleness and sweetness toward the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their righteousness is hard and unbending.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, this also is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others are too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are afraid of bearing any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything is acceptable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are exactly the opposite of the stubborn ones just mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some are misled to think that a nice man is a holy man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But how many nice men has God used?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Was the Son of God a nice man on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, this kind of disposition is also a sin and needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some are not too hard and not too nice, but they like to exhibit themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Wherever they are, they want to be noticed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wherever they go, they always want to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even when they do not have the opportunity to do anything, they still want to walk around and greet everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wherever they are, they are not satisfied until they let everyone else notice their presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They make their presence conspicuous no matter where they go, and they can never be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some brothers are very withdrawn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever they go, they do not like to exhibit themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They always sit in a corner.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is also sin, and it should be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some brothers are very quick.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others are very slow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One brother said once, Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have a quick disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I lose my temper quickly and I forget about it just as quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can explode with a big temper in the morning, but in five minutes it is over.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I go to work I have forgotten about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, his wife and children suffer for the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When he comes back from work, his wife is still suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is very strange to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He even considers himself to be very good!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a sin, and it needs to be dealt with also.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some are slow in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A matter can go unattended for a day or for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This disposition also needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every person has his own peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although some are saved, they are very severe toward others; they antagonize situations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything is important to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They never take advantage of others, but they never allow others to take advantage of them either.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They never hurt others, but if others hurt them, they will take an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are very calculating and never let anything go.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some are not severe to others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But they are very mean.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They take advantage of others even when it is only a matter of a few pennies.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They do not rob others, but they take advantage even of their servants or chauffeurs.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some are very talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Wherever they go, there is never a dull moment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They gossip about this family and criticize that family.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some are glib about the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whatever they know, they have to speak to others about them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some like to speak words of exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are not lying, but whatever they say, they exaggerate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All these dispositions have to do with our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we desire to overcome and live an overcoming life, we have to deal with all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are unable to rid ourselves of these things, we need to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have to talk about these matters because the daily walk of Christians today is far from being godly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some brothers can only see the faults of others; they cannot appreciate the virtues of others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only words of criticism come forth from their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One time a brother from northern China had a breakthrough in overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Formerly, he could never stop finding fault.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When a person came to him, he would point out six or seven things wrong with him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When another came, he would point out six or seven more problems with the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I told this brother that he saw so many problems in others because he himself was the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This was his disposition, his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, all of these are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Every overcoming Christian lives above these things, not under them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>No Willingness to Obey God s Word</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Not only do we have sins on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Bible shows us that being negligent before God in our intention to obey His Word is also a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brothers and sisters, how much of God s commandments have you read, and how much have you obeyed?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How many husbands love their wives, and how many wives submit to their husbands?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A wife once said that she knew that she should submit to her husband; however, she always argued a little before submitting.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>She eventually realized that she has never had any true submission according to the standard of God s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This, of course, is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How many Christians realize that being sorrowful is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Bible says that we have to always rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>How many Christians have obeyed this commandment?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have to realize that being sorrowful is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Everyone who does not rejoice has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God s commandment is to be anxious in nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we become anxious, we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>According to God s commandment, being sorrowful and anxious is to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Of course, according to man, being sorrowful and anxious is not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>However, God s Word says that sorrow and anxiety are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should give thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is God s commandment that we give thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In everything we should say, God!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I thank You and praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even when we encounter difficulties, we should still say, God!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I thank and praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There is a story about a woman with nine children.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>She thought that the word on not being anxious must be very wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>She argued that a mother has to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>She thought that not being anxious was a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>She had lost two children through anxiety, and she thought she had to raise up the other seven in anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This sister did not see that anxiety is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>She thought that it was her duty to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>To always rejoice is a commandment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>To be anxious for nothing is also a commandment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>To give thanks in everything, even more, is a commandment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Victory and strength enable one to keep the commandment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Those who are unable to overcome cannot keep God s commandments.</S>
