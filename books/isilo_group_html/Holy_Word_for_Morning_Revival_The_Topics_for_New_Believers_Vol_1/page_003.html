He who does not love abides in death.</p><h2 class="head1">By the Word of God</h2><p>How can we have the assurance of salvation? There are three means: Our first means of assurance of salvation is God&#8217;s Word. While man&#8217;s word may be untrustworthy, God&#8217;s Word remains sure and steadfast. It is impossible for God to lie (Heb. 6:18; Num. 23:19). Whatever God says stands firm forever (Psa. 119:89).</p><p>What God has said is not a matter of conjecture. His Word is neither vague nor intangible. It comes to us today in written form, the Bible. The Bible is God&#8217;s very Word, inspired by Him (2 Tim. 3:16). We can take this Word, believe this Word, and trust this Word.<sup>17</sup></p><p>Man acquires an inheritance by a testament [a will]. The written words of the covenant in the Bible were left to us by the Lord as a testament (Heb. 9:15-16), by which we may inherit the blessings of His salvation.<sup>18</sup> What then does God say about salvation? He says that the way of salvation is a person, Jesus Christ (John 3:16; 14:6; Acts 10:43; 16:31). He says that whoever believes that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord is saved. He says that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (Rom. 10:9-13). Have you done this? Have you believed in Christ and confessed openly that He is your Lord? Have you called on His name? If so, you are really saved. God says so. That settles it.</p><h2 class="head1">By the Spirit&#8217;s Witnessing with Our Spirit</h2><p>[Second], what the Bible speaks to us from without, the Spirit confirms within. First John 5:10 says, &#8220;He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony [witness] in himself.&#8221;<sup>19</sup> The assurance of our salvation is based on the Spirit&#8217;s witnessing with our spirit (Rom. 8:16)....Everyone who believes in the Lord enjoys addressing God as &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221;...Moreover, every time we call Him &#8220;Abba, Father,&#8221; we feel sweet and comfortable within. This is because we are children begotten of God, we have God&#8217;s life, and the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son has entered into us. Concerning our father in the flesh, it is spontaneous and sweet for us to call him &#8220;Father.&#8221; Therefore, since we enjoy calling God &#8220;Abba, Father,&#8221; and do it spontaneously, even with a sweet and comfortable sensation, this proves that we have God&#8217;s life and are children begotten of God. Hence, by the Spirit&#8217;s inner witnessing with our spirit we can know with certainty that we are God&#8217;s children and that we are saved.<sup>20</sup></p><h2 class="head1">By Our Loving the Brothers</h2><p>[Third], the assurance of salvation is based on the fact that we love the brothers. First John 3:14 says, &#8220;We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers.&#8221; Since God is love (1 John 4:16) and since we have His life, we surely have the divine love. Furthermore, since we have been begotten of God, we certainly love those who have been begotten of Him (1 John 5:1). When a saved one sees a brother in the Lord, he has an affection for him and even loves him in such a manner that is incomprehensible to himself. Therefore, our love toward the brothers in the Lord is a proof by which we know that we have been saved. This is a proof of our experience of life, which we may call the proof of love. By our believing- believing in the Lord-we have life and have passed out of death into life; by our loving-loving the brothers-we know that we have life and that we have passed out of death into life. Therefore, by the clear words of the Bible, by the sensation in our spirit, and by the experience of love, we can know with certainty that we are saved.<sup>21</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
