<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>10. Living by Faith in God</H2><P>We learned to serve the Lord in the way of not being hired by anyone, that is, by any mission, organization, or so-called church. We learned to live by faith in God. Watchman Nee took the lead among us to live in this way. In Watchman Nee's Testimony, Brother Nee shares his experience of living a life of faith (pp. 44-55).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>11. Divine Healing</H2><P>Through Brother Nee's experience, we were brought into a realization of the proper divine healing that builds up the inner life. The divine healing which Brother Nee saw and experienced was not just an outward gift, but a healing that resulted in inward building up. Brother Nee himself experienced such a healing. He was close to death with tuberculosis in 1929. He was so ill that he could not even rise up from bed to walk. One day he received a particular word from God in the Scriptures. He stood on that word and rose up from bed. He walked to a saint's home where some brothers and sisters had gathered together to pray for him. When he spoke to them of his healing, they all were full of thanksgiving and praise (see Watchman Nee's Testimony, pp. 30-38).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>12. The Death, the Resurrection, the Ascension,<br>and the Second Coming of Christ</H2><P>The Lord showed Brother Nee so much concerning the all-inclusive death of Christ in both its objective and subjective aspects. He also showed Brother Nee much truth concerning the resurrection, the ascension, and the second coming of Christ. In 1925 I began to read some of his publications on these truths.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>13. The Indwelling of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>The crucified, resurrected, ascended, and coming Christ is now indwelling our spirit by His Spirit. Brother Nee spent much time on the truth concerning the indwelling Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>14. The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Brother Nee himself had a rich experience of the outpoured Holy Spirit, but he never spoke in tongues. He referred to the baptism of the Holy Spirit as the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</P>
