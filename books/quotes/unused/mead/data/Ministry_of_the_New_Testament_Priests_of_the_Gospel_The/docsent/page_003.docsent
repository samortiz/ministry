   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the five messages of this book we will particularly cover a unique matter in the New Testament, that is, the New Testament priests of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people know what the term priest means.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In brief, a priest is one who devotes himself to the service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the record of the Bible, the matter concerning the priests is not a small one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1 and 2 show us several special points in God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, God created man in His image and after His likeness; this indicates that He wanted man to express Him 1:26a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, God gave the governing authority on earth to the man whom He had created; this shows that He wanted man to be His representative to rule over all things on earth v. 26b . Third, God created man with a spirit 2:7 , the organ by which man contacts and receives God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fourth, after creating man, God placed man in front of the tree of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>8-9 ; this indicates that God wanted the man who was created in His image to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, God's intention in creating man was that the man whom He created would have His image to express Him and would be His representative to exercise authority for Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This God-created man had a spirit within him to contact God and receive God into him as his life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God made such an arrangement according to His intention for the man whom He had created so that man might serve Him, and to serve God is to be a priest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE TURN FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIESTLY SERVICE TO THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTLY SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Old Testament shows us that a priest is one who serves God and draws near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is a person who is very intimate with and close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wants His priests to impart His word and His desire with Himself into His people and to bring them before Him to be united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The priests, on the one hand, bring God to men, and on the other hand, bring men to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the priestly service in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Beginning with John the Baptist</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know that the things mentioned in the Old Testament were mostly types and shadows, and these types and shadows have been fulfilled and realized in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The matter of the priests is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the New Testament the type of the priests has been fulfilled, and the shadow of the priests has been realized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning the priestly service, there was a great turn from the Old Testament to the New Testament, a turn which began with John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John was born into a priestly family; he was the only son of Zachariah, who was a leading priest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, according to God's ordination, John was a priest by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the biblical record, he can be considered the last priest of the Old Testament, but he rejected that service and turned to another service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he grew up to full age and was ready to fulfill his priestly ministry, he should have lived in the holy temple to learn how to be a priest, and he should have eaten the priestly food, put on the priestly garments, and carried out the priestly work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, he lived in the wilderness, a deserted and wild place that is without culture and religion Matt 3:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The life he lived was also in a wild condition; he wore camel's hair and ate locusts and wild honey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The things he did were seemingly very wild.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He cried aloud, preaching repentance unto God, and he buried the repentant ones, one by one, into water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From that time, with him there was a turn from the Old Testament priestly service to the New Testament priestly service, from something physical to something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Offering Repentant Sinners as Sacrifices</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament the priests offered mainly cattle, such as bulls and goats, as sacrifices, but what John the Baptist offered were repentant sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He turned to become the first God-ordained priest of the gospel of the New Testament, offering not sacrifices, such as bulls and goats, but sinners gained through his preaching of the baptism of repentance Matt 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, beginning with John the Baptist, the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel is primarily to offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Unlike the Old Testament priests who worked on bulls and goats, the New Testament priests work on sinners.</S>
