   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 35 Date:August 12, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER G. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I graduated from a seminary in 1928 and knew that it was wrong to be a salaried worker.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later the Lord led me to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I began to take the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day I read an open letter by Brother Nee which said that it is not enough merely to observe outward signs like baptism, the breaking of bread, head covering, and leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One has to take care of the things related to the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the war broke out, I went to southeast Asia and engaged in business for a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The business went well, and I thought it was my ability that made this happen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I began to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later the Lord disciplined me, and I failed in my business.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The employees were not in harmony, and I had much vexation and tears.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, I wrapped up my business, returned to the Lord's way, and decided to be a servant of the Lord once again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I came to the mountain, I felt that I was bruised all over and that this would be a good opportunity for me to recuperate from my wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when I heard Brother Nee's messages on resurrection, I realized that I am not here to recuperate or to care for my wounds, but to experience the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This power and life of resurrection is in me already.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The recovery of my whole being actually seems to have come about much quicker than I expected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have also seen that Christ is my Head and that I am a member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever the Head has, I also possess as a member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This fills me with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's power and grace are in me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am like an empty vessel in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Water is all around me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As far as the Lord's work is concerned, I know that I am not qualified for it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not need a long time to accomplish His recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In resurrection, we gain back what has been lost in death in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as a person is in resurrection, he is in total and complete recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Resurrection is not a progression; one regains everything in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In resurrection there is not only a recovery, but the recovery is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A tree has to go through a long process from sprouting to fruitbearing, but in resurrection, Aaron's rod budded, blossomed, and bore fruit all at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The budding, blossoming, and fruitbearing all happened in one night.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Resurrection is different from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a great matter, and it is something that the natural man cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have to drop the idea of recuperation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If your recovery is in the principle of resurrection, it will be instantaneous, not gradual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You said that you are not qualified for the work, but none of us are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We only need to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The building up is not in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a man falls into the water, he does all that he can to keep himself from sinking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who struggle with their last breath are not ready to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A sinner must be allowed to remain a sinner until he finds that he cannot save himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only then can he be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as a man cannot save himself in the matter of salvation, he cannot save himself in the matter of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man can empty himself completely like a sinner and does not try to save himself, but rather falls down completely before God, he is qualified to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a worker has not been stripped of all his props, he cannot do God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will think that he has a fine record, and that he still has the strength to prop himself up in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unless, however, these props are completely removed, he cannot work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A worker must allow these props to fall down completely, allowing nothing to remain, before he will find the Lord coming to his rescue.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When a man tries to build up his own righteousness, he offends God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before Paul was called, he considered killing others as a service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was more extreme than Peter, who only considered cutting off the ear of the servant of the high priest as a service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Saul fell down on the way to Damascus, a worker fell down, not just a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His salvation was not only the salvation of a sinner but the salvation of a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He had been serving God in an absolute and self-sacrificing way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When he fell down, it was a total and complete fall.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In principle, we should fall down from our many services as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we consider as a service to God is just persecution, rebellion, and destruction in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To us, it is obedience and building, but to God it is opposition to Him and alienation from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>During the past few years, I have alluded to Saul's story over a hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After Saul fell and met the Lord, he did not ask to whom he should deliver his letters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There were many who were traveling with him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead he asked, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before he met the Lord, Saul probably prayed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He could claim that he had a clear conscience, but actually he was in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He feared God, but he was a murderer who considered that it was a service for God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When he fell on the way to Damascus, everything was finished for him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was completely emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It was then that he cried, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not think that we were unqualified at some point and that we will be qualified as some later point.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Beginning from Saul and Peter, who failed completely before God, all the way to the present time, I have not seen one servant of God who has been used by God without first falling down completely.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The prayer of the tax collector and that of the Pharisee give us a comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The tax collector's prayer was not for progress.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He was not like the Pharisee, who fasted once a week and tithed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He prayed for God to have mercy on him, a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If he ever accomplished anything, he would have acknowledged that it was the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As workers, we must sooner or later fall down on our face and say, "The Lord is the only One who can make it; I cannot make it."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Unless we do this, we will never know what the Lord's work is and what our own work is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A worker should not remind himself to be humble and meek; he has to fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Humility is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The only thing that is useful is falling down.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A worker has to fall in the same way that a sinner falls.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to realize that humility is not something worked up by ourselves but something wrought into us by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Daily we have to have a stricken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we have such a spirit, we cannot be proud even if we want to.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We can tell a child to be careful, but he will forget all about it after two minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But if we spank him first and then tell him to be careful, he will behave himself immediately, even before his tears are dry.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the reason I say that our humility must come out of the Lord's chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Let me repeat: A man must fall and fall completely!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "It is no longer I..but it is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He could say this so easily because he had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When he said that he was crucified with Christ, it meant that he had fallen down.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then he was able to say, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is not easy for a person who has gone through such an experience to be proud or to give glory to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Today many people have to consciously resist pride; they have to remember to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This only proves that they have not fallen down completely.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I do not expect our brother to stand up again.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Rather, I expect him not to stand up again.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Will he do everything by himself from now on, or will he do everything by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He will have to make a clear distinction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After he leaves the mountain, even if he finds that he is able to do something, he should still fearfully say, "I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is not I but the Lord who is doing it."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Everything that we have must go into the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It must then come out on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If it can come out on the other side, it is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Even Paul's boastings were meek, comely, and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>With us, however, even our humility is ugly and uncomely.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The self does not have to be recovered; it needs to fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It would be terrible for a gospel preacher to tell a sinner to fast, pray, and improve himself.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Instead, we should say, "We do not make any resolution of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have not run.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Everything is of God who grants mercy" Rom 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We must fall down and realize our utter inability.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If there is any worth in us, it is the result of the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is the way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I would also point out that our brother possesses lucid utterance and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>But he also must have a strong spirit so that he can impart his words and thoughts to others.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>God has great things for us to do, but we need a strong spirit to match them.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If a man is strong in his spirit, his thoughts and words will become useful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>When a worker speaks for God, he has to push out his words with a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is a glorious way.</S>
