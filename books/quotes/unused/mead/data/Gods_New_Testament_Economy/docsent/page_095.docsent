   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BDELLIUM, SILVER, AND PEARLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In type in Genesis, in the actual building in 1 Corinthians, and in the fulfillment in Revelation there are only three categories of materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Also, their sequences are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gold is first and precious stones are last.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In between these two items we see bdellium in Genesis, silver in 1 Corinthians, and pearls in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Bdellium is not something of the animal life but of the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible the animal life with the blood is for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, in the Bible the plant life signifies the producing, multiplying, and propagating life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Bdellium is out of the plant life in Genesis 2 and pearl is out of the oyster, the animal life in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reason for this is because in Genesis 2 sin had not come in yet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The producing of bdellium out of the plant life means that at this time there was no need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After Genesis 3 when sin came in, God still wanted to produce the pearls but now there is the need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in the process of the actual building in 1 Corinthians 3 the second item is silver which signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in the conclusion or the fulfillment of the divine revelation, a sign of God s redemptive work will remain forever as the pearls, signifying the produce of Christ in His redemptive work with His secreting life for the entry into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Genesis 2 there was only the tree of life without the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in Revelation 22 is the tree of life with the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tree of life grows in the river of water of life, which flows out of the throne, not only of God but also of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lamb is not implied until Genesis 3 when Jehovah God made coats of skins to clothe Adam and Eve after man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In eternity the pearl will not be a kind of bdellium produced out of the plant life, the producing life, but a pearl produced out of the animal life, the redeeming and producing life, a pearl produced by and out of the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE BUILDING MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In all three sections concerning God s eternal building, the materials are always three in number and are in a unique sequence gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These materials are three in number because the actual material for God s building is the processed Triune God God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God would never use anything other than Himself in His processed Trinity to build up His dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It would be impossible for a man to build a house for himself with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only way that a contractor could build a house with himself as the material would be to kill himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we must ask the question who killed Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For Jesus martyrdom, the Jews killed Him, but for Jesus redemption, God killed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pilate sentenced Jesus to death but this sentence was a persecution for martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Isaiah 53 tells us that God judged Jesus, that God condemned Him, and that God gave the verdict of death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4, 6, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was God Himself who killed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The One who was killed on the cross was the Man Jesus, but He was not merely a man but a Triune God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the cross, the very God killed the Triune God-man for the purpose of redeeming us and secreting Himself as the life-juice around His redeemed ones to make them into pearls for the building up of His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, we may say that God killed Himself in man in order to be the building material for His eternal dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>LIVING STONES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND PARTAKERS OF THE DIVINE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Apostle Peter was an uneducated and unlearned person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a Galilean fisherman he had very little schooling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In spite of this, Peter in his first Epistle told us that Jesus Christ his Lord is the living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He also told us that we who come to this Jesus are also living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To speak such a word needs much realization which comes from the proper knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Peter s second Epistle he furthermore told us that we all are partakers of the divine nature 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We not only inherit the divine nature in the future but we are partakers of the divine nature, partaking of, enjoying the divine nature, today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although Peter was an uneducated fisherman, he could tell us that the Lord is the living stone, that he also was a living stone, that we all are living stones, and that we partake of, enjoy, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the pure Biblical teaching, not the ethical or philosophical teachings of Confucius or other philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no comparison between the philosophical books and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible teaches people in a divine way showing us that we believers have God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a doctrine but a reality.</S>
