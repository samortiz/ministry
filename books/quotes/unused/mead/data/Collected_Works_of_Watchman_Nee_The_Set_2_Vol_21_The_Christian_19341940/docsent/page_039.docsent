   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Peter saw the tax collectors coming, and he made up his mind to tell them, "Yes, yes.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I can guarantee that we will pay the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have been with the Lord for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I know that He will pay it."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Lord would not allow him to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was no reason to allow him to go on speaking in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he had gone on speaking, the whole foundation of Christianity would have been shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The previous passage concerned a question about the content of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What was at stake now concerned the foundation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Mount of Transfiguration speaks of the content of Christianity, while in the house, we see the foundation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fact that He is the Son of the living God cannot be challenged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is another significance to paying the temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If He needed to pay this tax, it meant that Christ also required redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, this is not merely a question of paying or not paying the tax, but of whether or not He should pay the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord Jesus paid the tax, it would mean that the Son of God required redemption just as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I once met a Catholic who condemned me for not worshipping Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I told him that I do not worship Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He asked me why, and I told him that Mary was the same as us; she needed the Savior just as much as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On what can I base this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When she was pregnant, she said, "My spirit has exulted in God my Savior" Luke 1:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She also needed a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the Lord Jesus did not need a Savior, because He had no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Lord Jesus wanted a Savior, it would not be humility but lying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus is most humble, but He cannot be so humble as to say that He has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Lord Jesus needed to pay tax, it would mean that He needed redemption also.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christianity is built upon these two foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One is that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, and the other is that Jesus of Nazareth has no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus of Nazareth not only is the Son of God, but is God's Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Son of God speaks of His position, while God's Beloved speaks of His morality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why the Lord would not allow Peter to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He could not say anything or open his mouth anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not have the position to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank the Lord that He did not have to pay the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter should have known that the Lord did not have to pay the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But then the Lord presented another principle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This principle should render us much help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"But that we do not stumble them."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means, "Lest we stumble them, lest we offend them, you should go and fish, and take the fish that you catch and open its mouth, and you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus tried to make it clear to Peter that He did not pay the tax because He was a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He paid the tax because He did not want to stumble them; He did not want to make them feel uncomfortable or unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He only knew to pay the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord realized that the whole foundation rests on the fact of who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Never think that our foundation lies in something that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is a fallen Christianity, a backslidden Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christianity is not a religion in which we do something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not a matter of us doing something, but a matter of who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is He man or is He God?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some have asked what they should do in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The apostle answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to see that He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man's eyes are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Consequently, he asks what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this is not the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The issue is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Who was the One who was born in Bethlehem two thousand years ago and grew up in Nazareth as a carpenter?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Jews said that He was a bastard.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some said that He was Elijah or one of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But who do you say that He is?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If God gives you a little insight, you will see that Jesus of Nazareth is God coming to earth; He is the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you see this, all problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The problems of all those who believe that He is God are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once we acknowledge Him as God, the issue of work is over.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the main issue.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, although He is the Son of God, He paid the tax because He did not want to make others unhappy or uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a lesson for us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There are many things which we do not have to do, which we nevertheless do.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We often have the right to not do certain things, but we give up that right anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can maintain our right, but we often do not, because we do not want to stumble or offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should obey His word, take out a stater from the fish we have caught, and use it as tax money.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To be afraid of others' criticism is to follow a wrong principle; if we do something because we are afraid of others' criticisms, our way is too broad; it is no longer a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, it is equally wrong for us to try to maintain our right or save our money.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is not an ordinary case of fear of criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have the right not to do things, and we have every reason to protect ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But we may do something because we are afraid of alarming or stumbling others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For the sake of others, not for the sake of ourselves or for the sake of upholding our own right, we cannot insist on our own right.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Instead, we can learn to bear the cross and lay down our own right.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After a long time, perhaps half a year after Pentecost, Peter went down to Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Before he went, he had a prejudice against the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He was a Christian, but he was a Jewish Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He was a Christian, but he was also a Jew, just as you are a Christian, but also Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is why God sent a sheet from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The sheet indicated to him that as long as he was in Christ, there was no difference between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In Christ there is no distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles; there is only one church, and everyone is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord showed him a vision and pointed out that everything inside the sheet was clean.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Peter thought that the Jews were a special, privileged group, that they received special grace from God, and that it was hard for the Gentiles to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But God showed him that only the inner man is related to God's grace; there is no difference between the Jews and Gentiles in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, God sent him to the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He found himself preaching in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Yet one thing still could not be erased from his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The middle wall of partition was still there.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He considered the Gentiles as dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He thought that God had granted special privileges to the Jews, and that they were a special group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He could not believe that the Gentiles could receive the same grace that the privileged Jews had received.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He had seen the principle and the vision, and he confessed with his mouth that God is no respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But in practice, there was still some problem.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We say with our mouth that there is no distinction between the Chinese and other nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We know this as a principle, and we have seen the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But when it comes to practice, we act differently.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Before Peter finished his words, while he was yet speaking and about to continue, the Holy Spirit came in and fell upon them all.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>All the Gentiles, with no exception, began to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The tongue-speaking interrupted Peter's word.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Later, Peter realized that the Holy Spirit had descended upon the Gentiles in the same way that He had descended upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He testified that just as the Holy Spirit had fallen on them, the Holy Spirit had fallen on the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He had no choice but to baptize them and recognize them as Christians.</S>
