   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CLEAR SKY AND THE THRONE VINDICATING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whether brothers and sisters would listen to you or not depends upon where you are and what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are you under a clear sky?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are under a clear sky, you do not need to argue; you do not need to claim anything; you do not need to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The clear sky will vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The throne above the sky will vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the local churches need this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We don't have any kind of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We don't have any kind of hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We only have a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We only have a throne above the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not have a mission board or any other kind of board.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We only have a clear sky with a throne.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am afraid of only one thing that I would lose the presence of my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times in my room I have told the Devil and the whole universe and myself that I am afraid of only one thing: I am afraid that I might lose the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as I have the presence of the Lord, I am afraid of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as I have the presence of the Lord, I care for nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I only care for His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, I only care for the clear sky with the throne above it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some have warned me saying that I criticize and scorn Christianity too much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They say that I should not speak so negatively about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me tell you dear ones that it is not up to me; it is up to the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would like to be a good man, and I do know how to be good, but I cannot help it I must speak the truth concerning Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What else can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a clear sky above me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more I speak the truth according to the Spirit, the more I get a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever I stand up and open my mouth, the clear sky is with me, and I have the full assurance that the throne is with me also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are too little.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are more than unworthy, yet the Lord has visited us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In your local church you must not care for anything except having a clear sky with the throne above it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as you have a clear sky with the throne above it, opposition and criticism mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only thing you need to care for is the open heaven, the clear sky with the throne above it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE THRONE BEING IN THE LIKENESS OF</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A SAPPHIRE STONE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to see one other point about the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ezekiel 1:26 says that the throne is in the likeness of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From Exodus 24:10, we can understand the meaning of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A sapphire stone signifies a kind of heavenly condition which exists when God is present in a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Exodus 24:10 shows us that when Moses, Aaron, and all the chief men of Israel saw God, they saw under His feet the appearance of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That gave the people an insight into the appearance of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exodus 24 also says that at that time the heavens were exceedingly clear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God was present in that kind of situation and atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the sapphire stone signifies the situation or the condition of the heavens with God's presence in it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The throne being in the likeness of a sapphire stone shows the presence of God in a heavenly situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No doubt, whenever you have the throne of God in a clear heaven, the situation must be heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It cannot be anything earthly or gloomy or impure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It should be heavenly, clear, clean, and absolutely transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This portrays what kind of situation and condition we need to have in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever we have a clear sky with God and we are in front of His throne, the situation will be like the sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sapphire stone is blue in color.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Blue is a heavenly color indicating the situation and condition of God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we have a clear sky with God's throne in it we are in a kind of heavenly situation having the appearance of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us again look at the picture: the Lord is upon the throne above the firmament in the heavens, and the living creatures are walking and standing upon this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through them the Lord in the heavens becomes one with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The heavens are connected to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The heavens have been brought down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The heavens are now moving upon this earth through, by, and with all the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This must be the situation among the local churches; this must be the situation among the overcomers; this must be the situation in our daily Christian life.</S>
