   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Not Defiled with Women</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4 says of the firstfruit that they were not defiled with women, for they are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as there has been a debate about whether the number one hundred forty-four thousand is literal or figurative, there has also been a debate regarding the understanding of virginity mentioned in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this portion of the Word, all the one hundred forty-four thousand living overcomers are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some say that this virginity is literal, and others say that it is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The virginity here should be the virginity mentioned by the Lord in Matthew 19:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the same principle can be applied to the sisters 1 Cor 7:7, 34, 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle of virginity is that we should not be defiled by anything earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we take this only literally, then all the sisters will be excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But it is not right to exclude the sisters from being among the living overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be a living overcomer we must be kept by the Lord s grace from every defilement and pollution and live on earth like virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the eyes of the worldly people it means little whether we go to the movies or not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the eyes of the saved ones it is serious for me to go to a movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I did, I would be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must live a life of virginity, a life of chastity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason I neither smoke nor drink is that I do not want to be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On occasion some brothers have offered me a drink of beer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But I have always refused.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord s mercy and grace have preserved me for more than fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will not sell myself so cheaply as to be contaminated by drinking beer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although it may not be sinful to drink beer, I will not allow the drinking of beer to defile my virginity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But do not be legal about things like this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can sit in the presence of brothers who are drinking beer and not be bothered at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is absolutely not a matter of legality; it is a matter of our desire to preserve ourselves as virgins for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all must say, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because I love You, I will remain as a virgin for You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, I don t want to be defiled or polluted by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, I want to keep myself for You.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a young man, I prayed this way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How I thank the Lord that He has truly answered my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In my travels throughout the years, I have found myself in many different situations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these situations there have been a great many temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I can testify, even before the accuser, that the Lord s grace has preserved me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although there have been television sets in many of the hotel rooms, the Lord can testify for me that not once did I turn on the television.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It would not have been sinful for me to watch television, but I would have been defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As I was in my room I said, Lord, I don t want to be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I want to be kept as a virgin for You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, I did not come to this city for television, but for Your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I know the brothers and sisters cannot see what I am doing in my hotel room, but the demons can see.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I had turned on the television set, my testimony for the Lord Jesus would not have had impact.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But because my conscience testified that I was not defiled and that I was kept as a virgin for the Lord Jesus, my speaking had an impact.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is deplorable to make the Lord s salvation a matter of legality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should never say that we cannot do certain things because our church forbids us to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a pitiful attitude!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With us, it is not a matter of legality, but of a loving desire for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We love the Lord Jesus and earnestly desire to be preserved as chaste virgins for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever I am in a department store, I look to the Lord that He would keep me from becoming defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what it means to be a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Both the brothers and the sisters may be virgins for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you pray to the Lord in this manner and desire to live like a virgin, all the bugs will be under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way to be a living overcomer, one of the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may be wondering about the difference between the overcomers in chapter twelve and the overcomers in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In chapter twelve we have the man-child, and in chapter fourteen we have the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the messages on chapter twelve we saw clearly that the man-child is for fighting and defeating Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the man-child deals with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The firstfruit is not for fighting; it is for the satisfaction of God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God and the Lamb need enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We, the living overcomers, shall be the firstfruit to satisfy Their need for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The enemy, the Devil, in heaven must be cast down by the man-child, who will execute the Lord s judgment over him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the function of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But there is another need in the heavens God must be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He desires some firstfruit to taste for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here again we see the sovereign wisdom of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The overcomers who have died throughout the centuries will be the man-child, the fighters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although we who are living on earth must also fight against the enemy, there is no need to fight him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After you have preached to Satan for a while, you should forget about him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The enemy is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once you begin to preach to him, he will attract you to preach to him constantly, saying, My face has become very thick, and I have no sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I would like to hear you preach to me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He would do this in order to distract you from loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, after preaching to the Devil for a period of time, you should say, Devil, I have no more time to preach to you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, I would use my time to tell my Lord how much I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I want to remain with my Lord in a loving way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Satan, you are the Lord s enemy and you are my enemy too.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have preached enough to you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Get away now is the time for me to enjoy a honeymoon with my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Learn this strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not preach to Satan for too long a time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After preaching for a certain period of time, you must stop and spend your time in loving the Lord, saying, Lord, I enjoy looking at You and talking to You.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Lord, I want to satisfy You, to be one with You, and to stay in Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Learn to spend time loving the Lord Jesus in an intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you have never had such a time, you are short.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not adequate merely to be sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not sufficient simply to be good or right.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must be in love with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Although I do not like the term in love, I am forced to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We all need to fall in love with the Lord Jesus, telling Him, O Lord Jesus, I love You, and You know that I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Because I love You, Lord, there are certain things that I will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the way to be a living overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although the Lord certainly needs the man-child to fight against His enemy, He needs the firstfruit, His lovers, even more to be His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In type, the firstfruit were brought not to the farmer s home, but into God s house, the temple, for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This was even true of the Lord Jesus as the firstfruit 1 Cor 15:20, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>On the morning of His resurrection, the Lord did not allow Mary to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He said, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord seemed to be saying, Do not touch Me, because I must present My freshness in My resurrection to My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>My Father must be the first to taste the freshness of My resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We all need to learn to present ourselves in a fresh, intimate, and loving way to the Lord for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If you decline to do certain things or to touch certain things simply because you are afraid of something, you are not on the high plane of being a lover of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Rather, you are down on the lowest level.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must be on the highest plane, refusing to do certain things, not out of fear, but out of love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The sisters desire to be with their husbands instead of going home to their parents because they love their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Likewise, because I love the Lord, I shall refrain from doing certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I may have the liberty to do them, and it may not be wrong to do them, but simply because of my love for the Lord Jesus, I would not do them.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is the true significance of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We need to follow the principle in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This principle is that we, sisters and brothers alike, must keep our virginity, looking to the Lord that, by His grace, He would preserve us for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should be not only fighters, but also firstfruit, those who ripen earlier for the Lord s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We need to say, Lord, for the sake of Your satisfaction, I want to ripen early.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Lord, I don t care for my rapture I care for Your satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I want to be taken to the heavens to satisfy You.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Lord, as long as I can satisfy You, it makes no difference to me whether I am on earth or in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This is the attitude of the living overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Because it does not matter to the firstfruit where they are, we are not told that they are caught up; instead, we are simply told that the one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruit are standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>As we have pointed out, this surely is not the Zion on earth, but the Zion in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If you are one of the living overcomers, it will make no difference to you whether or not you are raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Because you are already in the Lord s presence, the rapture will not come as a surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It does not matter to you whether you are in His presence here on earth or there on Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When you get there, you will not be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It would be wrong to say, Oh, I m here with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>I m in His presence!</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Those who will be raptured as the firstfruit will have no feeling of surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Rather, they will say, Lord Jesus, I have been with you continuously for years.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Lord, it makes no difference whether I m in Anaheim or in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>To the outsiders, it will come as a surprise for you to be standing on Mount Zion, but it should not be a surprise to you.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>It should be a common experience.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If you have been away from your husband for many years, you will be crazy with excitement when you see him.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>But if you are with him all the time, you will surely not be so crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Are you truly loving the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Are you in intimate fellowship with Him right now, being kept in Him as a virgin?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If you are, then the rapture will not come as a surprise; it will be an ordinary experience.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Although these verses on the firstfruit point to one kind of rapture, they actually say nothing about rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We are told that the man-child is caught-up, but we are told that the firstfruit are standing on Mount Zion with the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If you were to ask them when they got there, they might say, We are simply here.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We have no special feeling about being here because we have been in the Lord s presence for years.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We have lived in this atmosphere for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This is the rapture of the living overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>These are the firstfruit, those who satisfy the hunger of God the Father and the Lamb, the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>The earliest ones of God s crop to mature are not for fighting; they are for satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>I. No Lie Being Found in Their Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Verse 5 says of the firstfruit that In their mouth no lie was found.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Lies are the expression and representation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>The Devil is the father of all liars, and lies come out of him John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>That no lie was found in the overcomers mouth indicates that there is nothing of Satan in their expression.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>If we live a life of loving the Lord, then no lie or falsehood will proceed out of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Although I hate to say it, for years I have suffered the lies of genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>What a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>In the Lord s recovery there should be no lies and no falsehood in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>When we say Yes, we mean yes, and when we say No, we mean no. If we cannot answer with a clear yes or no, we should not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>In such a case we should exercise our wisdom to say nothing, so that no lies nor falsehood would come out of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>We have nothing to do with Satan, the liar and the source of the lies.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>J. Without Blemish</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Verse 5 also says that the firstfruit are without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>This indicates that they are without spot or wrinkle, but are perfect in the holiness of God Eph 5:27 , absolutely sanctified to God and fully saturated with God 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>K. Following the Lamb Wherever He May Go</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruit follow the Lamb wherever He may go v. 4 . It is not that the Lamb follows us, but that we follow Him wherever He goes.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>We all must learn the lesson of following Him wherever He goes.</S>
