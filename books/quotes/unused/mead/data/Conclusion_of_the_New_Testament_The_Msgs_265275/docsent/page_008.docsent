   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Nazarene</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His human living the Lord Jesus was a despised Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 2:23 says that Joseph "came and settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The title Nazarene may refer to the branch in Isaiah 11:1, which in Hebrew is netzer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The branch there, signifying Christ, is a sprout out of the stump of Jesse, the father of David.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the royal stem, stump, of David had been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now a new twig sprouted from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sprouting and growing of this twig were in a situation of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, and He did not grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch not a lofty branch of a stately tree but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the Lord Jesus was a despised Nazarene who was born in a poor home and raised up in a despised city, He could contact every kind of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If He had been born as a king, few would have been able to approach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But He was born as a poor man, and He could and did approach every class of men, especially the poor and sick ones, such as the blind, the lepers, the sinners, and the tax collectors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He became their Friend to cherish them. a. The One Rejected by the World</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was the One rejected by the world Matt 2:13b, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus truly was the Most High God and the genuine royal descendant of the great king David.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to His status in both His divinity and His humanity, He should have been highly regarded and greatly exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But due to the way He was born and the environment in which He was born, there was no sign that He should have been regarded and exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, His physical appearance did not bear any beauty or form that could be attractive to human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, His way of living was not to make a show of Himself, and His way of working was quite peculiar to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His lowly humanity, He concealed all the excellent aspects of both His divine and human status.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, He was absolutely rejected by the worldly people according to their worldly view. b.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The One Despised by Men</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was also the One despised by men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was called Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Philip met Jesus, he knew that Jesus was the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man from Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Immediately Nathanael said, "Can anything good be from Nazareth?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 1:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He, the seed of David, had not been born in Nazareth but in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the Lord was raised in Nazareth, others did not consider Him as one born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord thus appeared as a Nazarene from Galilee John 7:52 , a town that was despised by the people at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a despised Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was low in rank and position.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to experience Christ as a Nazarene, as the One rejected by the world and despised by men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we experience Christ as such a One and walk in the way of the kingdom, we too will be rejected by the world and despised by others.</S>
