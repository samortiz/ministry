   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE GOD CONTACTING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH HIS SPEAKING Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:20-21; 2 Sam 23:2 GOD DESIRING TO CONTACT MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Genesis shows that man fell and was corrupted when he lost his connection with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man became empty and corrupt when he lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After man fell, God came to look for man and to communicate with man 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though man rejected God, God came to search for man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though man did not want God or have God, God still wanted to be with man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is God who desired to recover a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the fall God could not contact man based on His status as the God who dwells in unapproachable light 1 Tim 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is great and holy, and man is small and sinful; no man can stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people foolishly say, Please show me God, and I will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not have the realization that if God really manifested Himself as God, they would not be able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is too great and too holy, and we are too small and too defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have no way to approach Him, how can we see Him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because God cannot manifest what He is in Himself to man, He has to find another way to contact man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE WAYS THAT GOD CONTACTS MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God can contact man in one of two ways: He can contact man indirectly through an intermediary, or He could come in a way that allowed direct contact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The former way involves speaking to man through various channels, such as the prophets, but the latter way points to His coming as a man to be among men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is possible for us to contact one another by telephone or telegraph, but the best way to contact one another is face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God desired to contact man, surely He must have spoken to man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consequently, there would be a record of His speaking to man among all the books in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are over six thousand years of human history, and during these years there must have been some record of His speaking, His word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God desired to contact and communicate with man, He would not have remained silent for six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE BIBLE IS THE BOOK OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Consequently, we should investigate the books that have been written throughout the six thousand years of human history to see which book contains the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we need to consider several criteria in order to have a standard for assessment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, the book should clearly state that it is the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This may be compared to a person signing his name at the end of a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a book contains God s speaking, it should clearly state that it is God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, if a book contains the speaking of God, it should clearly speak of the origin of the universe, the progression of mankind, and the final destiny of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, it should contain prophecies concerning matters in the future, and every prophecy must be shown to have come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fourth, this book should contain a standard of morality that is quite high.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Fifth, this book should be especially powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sixth, the speaking of God in this book, while mysterious, should be very easy to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Based on these six criteria, it is easy to see that only the sacred writings of various religions need be considered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of these writings, the sacred writings of Buddhism cannot be considered as God s word because they do not speak of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since there are numerous religious systems that do not revere God, their writings cannot be considered as being the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only religions that truly revere God are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Judaism is based on the Old Testament, and Christianity is based on the Old and the New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Much of the content of the Koran is drawn from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the only book that uniquely states that it is God s speaking is the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible Declaring Itself to Be God s Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament the phrase thus says the Lord Jehovah is included over a thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is enough to prove that God has declared that this book is His word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the New Testament the apostle Paul says, All Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, according to the first criterion, the Bible has a proper claim to be God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible Unveiling the Origin, Progression,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>and Final Destiny of the Universe and Mankind</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second, there is no book in the world that speaks of the origin of the universe, the progression of humanity, and the final destiny of heaven and earth in such a clear and complete way as the Bible.</S>
