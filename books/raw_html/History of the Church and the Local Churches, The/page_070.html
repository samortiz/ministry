<P>Later this young brother was being transferred by his company from Chefoo to Shanghai. He asked me where he should meet in Shanghai. I told him that the booklet I had given him on the assurance of salvation had something in it concerning where a meeting of Christians was. I told him that he had better go there. He went to that meeting of the church in Shanghai. Eventually, he became one of the first three elders in Shanghai.</P><P>At the end of 1927, my denomination elected me to be one of the board members. By that time I was forced to tell them that I could not stay in that denomination anymore. That was the year I left them to go to a Brethren assembly. I went to Brethren assembly meetings faithfully every week. I picked up many good teachings there concerning typology and prophecy. Years later in August 1931, the Lord impressed me that I had received so much biblical knowledge, yet I was cold and dead. There was a real repentance within me. Thank the Lord that after I was saved, I never went back to the world. But by that time, although I attended so many Brethren meetings each week, I was cold.</P><P>When the Lord convicted me concerning my coldness, I rose early the next day. My home was at the foothill of a small mountain. I went to the top of this mountain and wept before the Lord with repentance. I was desperate. From that day I went there each morning to have a time with the Lord. I continued to pray in this way for a few months. During that time when I was seeking the Lord, Brother Nee held a victory conference in Shanghai in 1931. I attempted to go to Shanghai to this conference, but Japan had invaded Manchuria, and I was advised not to go. If I went, I ran the risk of being cut off from my home, so I canceled my trip. The young brother in my denomination who had gone to Shanghai returned to Chefoo the next year, and he told me about all the good meetings there.</P><P>He and I went to our former denomination, and we proposed that they should invite Brother Nee to come to speak to them. Although we had left that denomination, we left them with a very good impression of us. They still appreciated us as young men. They agreed to our proposal and invited Brother Nee. At the same time, the Southern Baptist seminary in a county close to Chefoo also invited him to speak to them.</P><P>In the summer of 1932, Brother Nee came to Chefoo, and I joined those who went to his boat to greet him. I attended all the meetings in which he spoke. I went with him to the Southern Baptist seminary, which by that time had become involved with the Pentecostal movement. In those years the Pentecostal movement was prevailing in northern China. This was the first time I had seen the practice of the Pentecostals. In the meeting some were jumping, others were rolling on the floor, some were laughing, and others were shouting. This went on for a time. Then the pastor called the meeting to order, and Brother Nee spoke. After the meeting, Brother Nee and I walked together. I remarked to him about the strange practices in their meeting. He said to me, "In the New Testament, there are no forms." Later he stayed in my home for two or three days. During this time we had long periods of fellowship. That was in July 1932.</P>
