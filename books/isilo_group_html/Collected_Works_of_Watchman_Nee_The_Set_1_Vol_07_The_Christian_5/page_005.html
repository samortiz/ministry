Now he proceeded on to the second section, "The New Concepts." He said, "We are like the ancient Greeks, always seeking for the new things, and we are still in the process of seeking." He was coming to the subject of evolutionary theology, and he was writing faster and faster.</P><P>While he was writing, suddenly two little arms embraced his neck. They were the arms of his only daughter, who was eleven years old. She had entered the study without her father noticing. She said, "Daddy, the meal is ready. Mother has called you three times. We thought you had fallen asleep."</P><P>The man pointed to his papers and said, "No, I have not fallen asleep. I am very busy. Do you know that your daddy is going to preach next Sunday in the big cathedral?"</P><P>While he was taking his meal, he spent the whole time talking about his sermon, and he told everyone how he came up with the theme. He also told them how he would spend the whole afternoon and evening writing his sermon. At that time, his daughter said, "But Daddy, you promised me that this afternoon you would take me to the top of the hill. What about it? Please take me there!" He shook his head, saying, "I am afraid that you have to wait until the following week after I have finished my sermon. What a pity that this is Wednesday already. Other than the time I spend on lecturing, I will have to spend all my time to prepare my sermon." The daughter was disappointed, and she was about to cry. The mother comforted her and told her that her father would surely take her to the hill the following Monday and would walk with her in the cemetery on the hill. There was also a cottage of an old farmer there.</P><P>That afternoon, the professor was busy writing. By midnight, he was still correcting his wordings over and over. Later he said, "Finally, I put the whole thing in order. Tomorrow, the day after, and Saturday, I will spend some time to read over it again and again." After he said this, he went to his bedroom beside his study to sleep.</P><P>The second morning, his wife came in earlier than usual and told him that his daughter did not sleep well the night before, that she had a fever, and that she was afraid that it was a kind of gallbladder disease. The mother gave the girl some medicine she had taken before. The father went to look at the child. The girl said, "Daddy, if you had taken me to the hilltop, to the cemetery and the farmer's house, I would not have become sick this morning." He kissed his daughter and said, "Next week I will surely take you there."</P><P>He went back to his study and busied himself with his new thoughts-his sermon. He had to go to a class at 2:00 in the afternoon; hence, he wanted to spend all his time on his sermon. At about noon, his wife knocked on the door and came in, saying, "I don't want to bother you, but Clara (the girl's name) seems to be very sick. She has a fever of 103 degrees. She kept talking about the hilltop. She is no longer conscious." He tried to call for the doctor to come right away. After lunch the doctor came, and he said that the sickness was very serious. Her fever was high, and her throat was burning. In the evening the doctor came again, and the child grew worse. He thought that the child had diphtheria, and he gave her a shot. The child was weak, and the fever did not go away. The parents watched her anxiously. The father went frequently to his study to kneel before the desk, on which lay his sermon, and cried out with tears, "O God, if You answer prayers, please save my child, my only child, Clara."</P><P>The next morning, the doctor came to visit them early. As soon as he saw the child, he was disappointed because the child had become worse. He asked a few other doctors to join him. The child breathed heavily and spoke hysterically, "Daddy, the hilltop." The doctors were all sober-faced. They decided that they should stay there for a few more hours.</P><P>The professor returned to his study. He wanted to pray, but could not do so. After an hour an older doctor, a Christian, came and knocked on his study door. The professor went over to open the door, and asked, "Doctor, how is she? Did she respond to the treatment? Will she recover?" The old man looked at him without saying anything, then bowed down his head. In the end he said, "Professor, come and see her lovely face. She has gone to a better place. To Christians, that is a better place." Before the word ended, the two were in the bedroom. The child was lying there with her eyes closed and her pale face smiling. The child had died.</P><P>The sad news spread quickly. A few students of the professor were sincere Christians. In the evening they gathered under the window of the professor's study and sang softly:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;<br>The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!<br>When other helpers fail and comforts flee,<br>Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.<br><br>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;<br>Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;<br>Change and decay in all around I see;<br>O Thou who changest not, abide with me.</P><P>They did not know that the professor was sitting by his desk. His sermon was laid aside, and all his reference books were on the shelf. In his hand was a Bible. Randomly, he turned to a page. At that time his eyes were filled with tears. It read: "Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me. In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be" (John 14:1-3).</P><P>At this time, while he was sobbing softly, he heard the singing outside:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>I need Thy presence every passing hour:<br>What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?<br>Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?<br>Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.<br><br>I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:<br>Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:<br>Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?<br>I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.</P><P>He turned to his Bible again and read, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and every one who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?" (John 11:25-26). He said with a trembling voice, "Lord, I believe." His eyes were immediately opened to see the vanity of the "New Trends in Thinking." In the depths of his heart, he realized that such thoughts gave him no hope and no comfort. What he believed in did not give him any life, power, or hope. In his time of sorrow, they could not render him any help. He knelt down to pray. Oh, what a prayer it was! He confessed his sins and committed himself into the bosom of his Lord.</P><P>On Monday they went up to the hilltop. The coffin of the child was covered with white flowers. The coffin was carried by four of the professors. The preacher read the Bible: "For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep; because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words" (1 Thes. 4:15-18).</P><P>After the coffin was lowered into the grave, the father stepped forth and spoke loudly to everyone, with his head bowed: "Friends, the child whom I loved has died. She is with the Lord who died for her. Before this open grave, I want to confess that this Lord is my Savior. The Lord left the heavenly glory to come to earth to die for our sins. He was buried and resurrected on the third day. He will still come back again to receive us unto His glorious self. By that time, my child will be back in my arms. This faith is what I have often denied before you, my students and colleagues. Now it is the only faith that will give me peace and hope."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
