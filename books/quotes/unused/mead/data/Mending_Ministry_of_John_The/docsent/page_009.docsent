   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST RETURNING AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suddenly Jesus was standing among them and saying, "Peace be to you"!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His words were few, but He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His words could also be translated, "Receive the holy breath."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A few more words, and He was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He came in without anyone's opening the door; He left without saying good-by.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was not that He went away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, He entered into them as the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From then on, wherever the disciples were, Jesus was also there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was within them!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here is Christ in resurrection becoming the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Gospel of John tells us this wonderful, mysterious story.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is his mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps no other book in the Bible portrays Christ in such a living yet spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>NEVER LEAVING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On a later occasion John 21:2-13 Peter, probably hungry and short of food, said to the others with him, "I am going fishing."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since he was taking the lead, the rest said they would go with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not one fish did they catch the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nonetheless, Christ was there!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At first they did not recognize Him when He spoke to them, but when they followed what He said, they caught fish in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Back on land, they saw that the Lord had prepared fish and bread for them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fish was there, already cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It had not been necessary for them to go to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the fish were in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not one would go into their net.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they needed fish, they had only to tell Him; He would provide them not only with fish but also with bread.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They could disregard all the fish they had caught and come and eat what the Lord had prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can all be assured that this Christ is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wherever we go, He is within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are happy with Him, attending the meetings, praying, and pray-reading, we may not have a strong sense that He is within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we go against Him, He will appear to us in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we go to a movie or to a gambling casino, He will speak to us from within, "What are you doing here?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our Lord is real, living, present, and within.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not have a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What need have we for a religion?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have the living Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is what we need and what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John's mending ministry strongly stresses this point that Christ lives in us 14:17, 23; 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is real, living, and powerful, yet kind, loving, and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must not think that if we offend Him, He will leave.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we offend Him, the more He will convince us that He will never leave!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John first introduces Jesus as God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually He tells us that this very One is now in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the embodiment of the Father 14:8-11 , He is the Son, and in resurrection He has become the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With Him we have the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is our life.</S>
