   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 4:2-3 A. Revelation 4:2</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John's spirit was raptured, not his body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Behold, there was a throne set in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The throne is the center of this book; it is also the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the throne which is seen first is the place out from which all the following events come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This throne differs from the throne mentioned in the epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 4 touches upon the aspect of God's grace the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 4:2 touches upon the aspect of God's righteousness the throne of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"And upon the throne there was One sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This One is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Revelation 4:3</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Jasper" is best translated as "diamond."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of all physical matter, a diamond resembles the color of light the most.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can break it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone treasures it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Its structure is the result of the transformation of coal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Its light is like the light of the gospel, which brings people from darkness into the realm of light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Sardius" is the most perfect red and signifies God's redemption because blood is red.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The significance of these two items is their colors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One signifies the light of the gospel; the other signifies the redemption accomplished by God through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"And there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The rainbow ordinarily seen on earth is shaped like an arc, but the rainbow here surrounds the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rainbow is the sign of God's covenant with Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From this we can see that God is a covenant-making God Gen 9:12-16 as well as a covenant-keeping God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is going to execute His judgment soon; nevertheless, He continues to keep His covenant and remember His promises and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Emerald" green is a grass green; it is the basic color of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that during God's judgment, He has grace and remembrance toward the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the earth has passed through judgment, the color green still remains Gen 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE TWENTY-FOUR ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>REVELATION 4:4</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and upon their heads golden crowns."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The common interpretation of Bible expositors is that the twenty-four elders refer to the entire glorified church, but their assertion does not have sufficient proof.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Recently, some quoted Revelation 4:4 and said that these elders have thrones and, therefore, are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They also said that in 5:8 the elders have harps and bowls full of incense and, therefore, are also priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, 1 Peter 2:9 says that the believers are a royal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since these twenty-four elders are kings and priests, Bible expositors reason that these elders represent the glorified church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to this kind of interpretation, however, the whole church would be raptured all at once and would not have to pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is not this against the spirit of this book?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then how about Revelation 3:10?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are still another ten major reasons that are sufficient to prove that the twenty-four elders are not the glorified church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>1 The term elder is not the same as the term church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the elders here refer to the church, would not that make the whole church elders?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to historical fact, God first selected the angels Isa 14:12; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>28:11-19 ; second, the Jews Gen 12:1-3 ; and third, the church the church was established in Acts 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church cannot be considered as the elders, and neither can the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ephesians 1:4 speaks of selection according to God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The chosen angels in 1 Timothy 5:21, however, are another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>2 The number of the elders is not the number of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The number of the church is seven, or at least a multiple of seven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the elders are the church, their number should be either seven or a multiple of seven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The number twenty-four is neither the number seven nor its multiple.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>3 The church cannot receive the throne and the crown before the Lord Jesus does.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The One who sits on the throne in Revelation 4:2 is the Father God the Lamb in 5:6 is standing .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, in 4:4 there is "the throne," and then there is the word "sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the original text, "sitting" is the same word as "the throne"; therefore, it should also be translated "throne."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These twenty-four elders who sit on the thrones also wear golden crowns.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we say that they are the church, why is it that the church sits, but the Lamb stands?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 5:6 the church is already crowned; hence, why does the Lord Jesus have to wait until chapter twenty to be King?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How can the church receive glory sooner than the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Besides, after Revelation 19:4 we cannot find any trace of the twenty-four elders.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we say that these elders represent the church, where has this glorious church gone?</S>
