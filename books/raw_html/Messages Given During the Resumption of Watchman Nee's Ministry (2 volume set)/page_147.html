<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH<br>AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br>THE BODY AND ITS MEMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (10)</H1><P>Date:April 17, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Truth Bearing No Relationship with Man</H2><P>In learning to take care of God's work, one basic lesson is to be absolute for the truth. No truth in the Bible is involved with man. Today, man is not absolute toward the truth because he gets himself involved with the truth. Because the truth becomes involved with man, when a man does not experience a truth, he feels that he cannot speak that truth. Yet a person has to realize that it is not because he has the experience that he is qualified to speak concerning a truth. Truth is absolute in itself. David said that all men speak vanity (Psa. 12:2). When he spoke this word, he was not considering himself. Before God, David considered himself a non-existing person. God's servants cannot look inward into themselves. God's truth is absolute; it is not involved with us in any way. Because the truth is absolute, we have to sacrifice ourselves, and we have to put ourselves aside.</P><P>Man always sacrifices God's word. Brother Yu and his wife are both here. Suppose there is something that a wife should not do in the church. Can our brother's wife do it simply because she is a responsible brother's wife? The responsible brothers often deal with themselves in one way and deal with others in another way. If we have to ask whether or not a thing ought to be done, then we have to put the same question to everyone involved in similar cases. A responsible brother cannot say that if such a case involves others, the question ought to be asked, whereas if such a case involves his own wife, the question can be skipped. Many times, we want God's truth to follow us. We become involved with the truth. As a result, we ourselves are drawn into the involvement.</P><P>Last year two brothers came to me and asked if a certain responsible brother had done something wrong. I answered that they considered the matter wrong only because they were not the responsible brothers themselves. If they were the responsible brothers, they would not have considered it wrong. This is what I mean by man affecting God's truth.</P><P>We have to realize that the condition of an individual has nothing to do with God's truth. If truth is affected by man, the truth will become the truth no longer. If the truth is not something absolute for you, you do not know God, and you do not know God's word.</P><P>In Foochow, twenty-seven brothers and sisters came and met with me. Originally, it was only going to be a talk between Brother Lee, Sister Wang, and me. In the end, all the others came. I could only present the truth to the brothers there. What I am personally cannot affect what God's truth is. We cannot say that a teaching is right simply because others are good to us, and we cannot consider the same teaching wrong simply because others are not good to us. Once the truth becomes affected by human factors, it becomes no more the truth; it becomes something else. If the truth is not absolute in you, you cannot go on. The truth can never be controlled by man. I cannot say that something is right simply because you and I are from the same school or were born in the same place. So many problems in the world arise and so many disputes in teachings result not because of a change in the truth itself, but because of changes in human factors.</P>
