   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WATCHING AND PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:2 Paul says, Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would stay in the spirit, we need to watch and pray, even to pray without ceasing 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only by praying without ceasing can we stay in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many years ago I did not appreciate the Lord s word about watching and praying Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in recent years I have come to see the importance of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to watch whether or not we are in the spirit and to pray that we may be preserved in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Are you tempted to exchange words with your husband or wife?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Watch!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you intend to go shopping for a certain item?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Watch to see whether you are shopping in the spirit or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be on the alert that we may stay in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also need to pray, Lord, grant me the preserving grace to remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, keep me in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we stay in the spirit, we shall experience the death of Christ in the all-inclusive, compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no need for us to reckon or even to believe that we have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All we need to do is to abide in the spirit by watching and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the spirit we experience the death of Christ and are released from all the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NO LONGER IN SUBJECTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 2:20, we have died with Christ from the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The elements of the world are the elementary principles of religion and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers tried to bring elements of the world into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also may be subject to such elements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unconsciously we may still be under the influence of our religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elementary principles we inherited from religion are elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Colossians Paul implies that anything we cling to other than Christ experienced by us is an element of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, a certain sister in the Lord may be nice, kind, and disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She had such a character even before she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now that she has become a believer, she brings this character into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others may appreciate her character, not realizing that it is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But whenever this sister lives according to her natural character, she is living according to the elements of the world, not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another sister in the church may have a character that is rather unrefined.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Compared to the first sister, she is crude and undisciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But day by day she exercises to watch and to pray and thereby to remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Gradually, others notice a change in her living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to describe her way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not altogether accurate to say that she is nice, kind, or disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She is not living according to the elements of the world, but according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a vast difference between this kind of living and living according to one s natural character.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elements of the world are useful in society, but there is no place for them in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we remain in our spirit, we spontaneously experience the death of Christ included in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this death we are dead to the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to see that such things as natural kindness are simply elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Under the light of such a vision, we shall hate even our kindness because it is not of Christ, but an element of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we shall seek to remain in our spirit to enjoy Christ and to participate in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We shall even be able to tell Satan, I am no longer living according to natural kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan, you have been deceiving me for years, keeping me under subjection to the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now I see that in Christ I have died from all these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the spirit I enjoy Christ, hold the Head, and participate in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this death I am released from the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we hold the Head by remaining in our spirit, we absorb all the rich elements of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One of these elements is our crucifixion with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only in the spirit are we free in a practical way from the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only when we are in the spirit can we declare that we have nothing to do with religion, philosophy, culture, or natural virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are in the spirit, we can hate these things, because we recognize that they are worldly and not of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no way to abandon the elements of the world unless we are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we try to do this apart from the spirit, our efforts will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we stay in the spirit by watching and praying, we have the experience of being dead with Christ to the elements of the world.</S>
