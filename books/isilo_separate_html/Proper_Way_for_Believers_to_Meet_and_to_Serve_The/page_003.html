RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation, which is God as our life, is far superior to religion and philosophy. A person who is not saved may be very proper in his conduct and in the way he deals with things. When he does a good deed, he is pleased with what he has done. He might say, &ldquo;I am charitable and honest. I may tell a little lie if necessary, but I would never tell a big lie. Not only so, I am humble and not boastful.&rdquo; Such a person does not know himself. It is easier for a person to lie and boast than it is to drink water and breathe air. A person can lie and not be conscious of the fact that he has sinned, and he can easily boast of his intelligence. Man is born with the ability to lie. The Bible says that man is born a liar because he is a child of the devil (John 8:44). Hence, man lies automatically. If a person raises his hand to say that he does not lie, his hand is lying.</p>
<p>When such a person hears the gospel and repents, his conscience is enlightened, and he realizes that he is sinful, proud, and full of lies. The conscience is an important part of the human spirit. The gospel of God speaks concerning sin, the law of God, and His righteousness in order to touch man&rsquo;s conscience. When man&rsquo;s conscience is touched, his spirit begins to operate. Before a person steals, he might think, &ldquo;There is an unbalanced distribution of wealth in society. The rich are very rich, and I have been poor for many years. Since the rich do not share their wealth with me, I will take it myself.&rdquo; This illustrates the functions of his soul: first, he likes money; second, he considers that it is reasonable to steal; and third, he decides to steal when the circumstance allows it. While he is having these thoughts, a voice deep within him says, &ldquo;Do not steal; it is not right to steal.&rdquo; This voice is his conscience in operation. If the desire in his soul is very strong and overpowers his conscience, he will steal. While he is stealing, he is afraid not only of the police but also of his conscience within him. Therefore, he must hide from the police and suppress the inner accusation of his conscience.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that regardless of race and nationality, the law of good operates among mankind. A person who does something bad is afraid of the law of good. The God of this universe put the law of good in man. This law operates in man. This is the difference between humans and animals. A dog that does something bad, such as biting someone or stealing food, will not lose its sleep or its appetite, because it lacks the operation of the law of good. Only humans can have such a reaction, because only humans have the law of good within them. When my children were young, I would tell them not to play with water. They would nod their heads submissively, indicating that they would obey. However, the moment I stepped out of the room, they would play with water. When they heard me open the door, they would immediately hide their hands behind their backs because their conscience told them that they had done something wrong. Every person knows that it is wrong to steal, because the law of good is operating in man&rsquo;s conscience.</p>
<p>As a result of man&rsquo;s fall, the function of his conscience was weakened. A person senses the accusation of his conscience when he does something very bad, but he does not feel anything when he does something that is not so bad. A person might have considered himself a gentleman before he was saved; he was not disturbed that he told white lies. However, after hearing the gospel and being enlightened, his conscience is activated, and he repents and confesses his sins. Initially, he does not think that he has committed many sins, but the more he confesses, the more he realizes that his sins are numerous. This indicates that the function of his conscience has been uplifted. Many who believe in Jesus are brought to tears when they repent and confess their sins. After a person receives Jesus as his Savior, he has peace and joy within and is able to praise Him for dying on the cross for him and for shedding His precious blood for his cleansing. This new believer will not be able to tell a white lie when he is tempted by Satan, because a believer has not only a keen conscience within him but also the Lord, who does not lie and does not cooperate with telling lies. It is as if an invisible hand bridles his tongue, making it impossible for him to lie. Every believer has had such an experience. These experiences prove that he is saved. Those who have not had such an experience might not be saved. Actually, it is not a hand that bridles a believer&rsquo;s tongue; it is a living person, the Lord Jesus, who bridles his tongue. Such experiences prove that not only is a person&rsquo;s spirit enlivened when he is saved but that God enters into his enlivened spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
