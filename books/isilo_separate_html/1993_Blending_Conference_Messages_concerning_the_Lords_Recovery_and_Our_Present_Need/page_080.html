We need to condemn the condition of Sardis among us and also abhor the situation of Laodicea. We need to hate these things, and we also need to get out of these things. This is not a common thing but a matter of life and death facing the whole recovery. It is a life and death matter that we all must be vitalized.</P><P>There are four needs among us in these days. First, the Lord needs a corporate overcomer for His testimony. The Lord needs to have the real testimony of Jesus. Second, the recovery needs to be vital today. The recovery needs a revival of morale, a revival of impact, a revival of the dynamic motivation within us, a revival of vitality among us. This is a real need in the recovery.</P><P>Third, the churches' need is for the prevailing increase. We need to grow; we need to multiply; we need to increase in the churches today. Although the Lord has granted us a substantial increase over the last five years in Southern California, based on the length of time the churches here have existed, our number should be much greater than it is today. We should not boast that we now have more than three thousand members in the churches in Southern California. We should labor and endeavor so that the Lord would increase the churches much more.</P><P>Fourth, as saints in the Lord's recovery, we desperately need to be vitalized. Through intimate and thorough fellowship, through confession, through consecration, through prayer, through our being soaked with the Spirit, through our laboring, and through our learning, we need to be vitalized. This is more crucial in the recovery today than it has ever been before. We all have a responsibility, we all have an obligation, before our Lord. We should pray, "Lord, make me vital. Make me vital today for the sake of Your move."</P><P>Therefore, we need a thorough reconsideration of our way. Is the way that we have been going the right way? We need to get on the God-ordained way. From 1984 until now, a period of almost nine years, the Lord has fully unveiled His ordained way to us. However, if we all are honest before the Lord, we must acknowledge that our reaction, our feeling, toward what the Lord has spoken through His ministry has been somewhat dull. The proof of this is that we are still not vital. We are still in our habit, still somewhat in our tradition. We need to be vitalized.</P><P>The vital groups should constitute eighty percent of the church life. In the beginning of the church age, immediately after the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they began to meet from house to house (Acts 2:41, 46-47); that is, they began to have vital group meetings. They did not have the name "vital groups," but they had the reality. As they were meeting in that way, day by day the Lord added many people to them. On another day five thousand men were saved (4:4), and at another time multitudes of disciples were added to them (5:14). All these were not only added, but they were also contained, supported, and kept as remaining fruit. This could take place only because of the practice of the vital groups. Their primary way of meeting was not in a congregational style with one man speaking. Their main way of meeting was to have vital groups in every home. They could have vital groups because each one of them was vital. It is not a matter of merely forming a group and calling it a vital group. We do not need merely the name "vital group"; we need the reality of being vital.</P><P>The vital groups cannot be formed by organization. We can testify from our experience that the way of forming vital groups by organization does not work well. Anything that is organic cannot be formed by organizing. Something that is organic can come into being only in a spontaneous and organic way. We need a drastic change in our concept. We should not attempt to organize vital groups by neighborhood, geography, language, or some other factor. This is not the way to be vital. In forming the vital groups, the first thing that we need is to be vital.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
