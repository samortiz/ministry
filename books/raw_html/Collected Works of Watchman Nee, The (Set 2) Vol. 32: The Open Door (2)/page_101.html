Men from Wei-Si came and said that the route through the snowy mountains in Wei-Si has been cleared only recently. Brother Hu was not able to leave Yeh-Ji to work elsewhere because of the blockage of snow. I intend to leave my family in Da-Li. If I can get the ticket, my whole family will set out."</p><p>(2) Brother Chen Hsi-wen wrote on April 14: "I intend to go to Yi-Nan to visit and then travel west. I am waiting for the Lord's arrangement and timing."</p><p>(3) Brother Stephen Kaung arrived in K'un-ming on the afternoon of April 27. It is said that he will travel with Brother Weigh on May 3.</p><p>(4) News from Chefoo on May 2: "During this week, there are two meetings a week at Brother Chao's house in West Hill in Chefoo. One meeting is the co-workers' meeting, and the other is the brothers' and sisters' meeting. During the brothers' and sisters' meeting, Brother Witness Lee spoke on Christ and the church. On the Lord's Day, April 30, there was a gospel meeting. Over thirty people stood up to receive the Lord. The Lord has been particularly blessing the gospel meetings on the Lord's Day."</p><p>(5) Sister Bao Hsu-min is said to be in Jien-Ou. The correspondence address for Brothers Wang Deng-ming and Wang You-yi is Tung-An, Fukien. Sisters Fang Chiung-ying and Weigh Kwang-ying are working in the villages around Han-Jiang in Fukien.</p><p>(6) Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote on April 17: "There has been more urging in the direction of the orphanage recently. I hope that, by the Lord's grace, I will not be influenced by the need and the urging. However, I do not want to be too self-assured or disobey the Lord through withdrawing myself. Under the present situation, even those who have the heart and the strength are afraid to touch such an endeavor. Please pray for this."</p><p>(7) Sister Peace Wang wrote on May 5: "On the first of the month, I returned from Cheung-Chau to Kowloon. Brother James Chen was recently in Hong Kong. Brother Luan is still resting in Cheung-Chau. I have preached the gospel a few times in Kowloon-Tong." On May 13 she wrote: "On the fifteenth I will go with senior Mrs. Nee to Macao.

Barring any hindrance, I will leave Hong Kong for Shanghai on June 3."</p><p>(8) Sister An Siu-fen has arrived in Shanghai from Chefoo.</p><p>(9) Brother Chou Shin-yih has returned to Shanghai from Chekiang. He is still very weak and in need of recuperation. He needs our prayer.</p><p>(10) Brother Hsu Dah-wei wrote on April 24: "The meetings in Ya-Yao-Tou in Bai-Sha, Ping-Yang, lasted for seven days (March 17 to 23). The co-workers and elders in the five counties of Fu-Ding, Tai-Shun, Wenchow, Rue-An, and Ping-Yang used this time together to pray in oneness before the busy farming season began. Here and there Brother Chang would release a little message. Every time we gathered together, we always prayed first, and then some would stand up to speak. The Lord was with us, and we experienced much blessing from the Lord. The Holy Spirit was operating clearly among us, and many wept for their sins. The messages of Brother Chang were about hating sins and being under God's light and also about God's standard and man's tradition. Sisters came from Ping-Tai and Fu-Ding to work among the sisters. They stayed for many days."</p><p>(11) A letter from northern Kiangsu on April 14 said: "The brothers and sisters in northern Kiangsu are all safe. But due to the political situation, some brothers are finding it difficult to sustain their living."</p><p>(12) A letter from Chefoo on April 13 said: "We began to meet on March 29 in West Hill. We should praise and thank the Lord for this."</p><h2 class="head1">ADDRESSES OF A FEW LOCAL CHURCHES</h2><p>[Omitted]</p>
