   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FLESH AND THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the time I brought the Lord's recovery to the United States, I have stressed four matters: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The burden concerning these matters has been very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message, however, I am burdened to speak about the flesh and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to know what the flesh is and how it is dealt with by the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Lord's recovery today, we need a word concerning the flesh and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our enjoyment of Christ may be full of leaven and honey and may also be lacking in salt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, I am burdened to minister salt, the cross, to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In speaking about the flesh and the cross, my concern is not doctrinal but experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we live in this body, we still have the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, we have been buried with Christ in baptism, but Satan tries to resurrect what has been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we need to be watchful, especially when we rise up in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having enjoyed the Lord in fellowship the night before, we may have slept peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we rise up in the morning, the evil flesh may try to follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the flesh has been buried, it will still try to incite us to think negatively about our wife or husband or about certain brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to realize that such thoughts are a devilish resurrection of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At such a time we need to pray, saying, "Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not want to walk by this ugly flesh instigated by Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I want to enjoy You, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, perhaps with tears, we may go on to pray, "Father, I take Your Son, my dear Lord, as my burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I cannot be absolutely for You, but I can enjoy such a life in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I take Him as my burnt offering to offer to You, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I also take Him as my daily food."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will bring us into the enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, as we are before the Lord, we will be enlightened and exposed, and we will see what kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this point we need the dear Lord Jesus as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is to take as our sin offering the very Christ who is our burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This sequence is not a doctrinal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, it is according to our personal, and often painful, experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we have the experience of enjoying peace with the Triune God, we will realize our need of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will confess to the Lord, saying, "Father, I have never realized that I am so sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not only sinful I am sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sin dwells in my flesh, and I am a totality of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I surely need my Lord Jesus to be my sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How I treasure Him as my sin offering!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever issues from the flesh is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether we criticize others or praise them, both have their source in the flesh and are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only way to deal with this flesh is the cross, the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need much salt in our daily life, family life, and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only when we have the salt will the "germs" become inactive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church life today needs "pest control," the killing of germs by the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This killing is the Lord's mercy; it is the Lord's merciful salvation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>SIN, THE FLESH, SATAN, AND THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the New Testament, there are four things that cannot be separated: sin, the flesh, Satan, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These four things are one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Three Denotations of Flesh in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible the word flesh has different denotations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, the flesh denotes the meat of the human body Gen 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second, in Genesis 6:3 the flesh denotes fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is also the denotation in Romans 3:20, where Paul says that "by the works of law no flesh shall be justified" before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Third, the flesh denotes the corrupted body Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God created the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But after the body was corrupted, it became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In contrast to a spiritual person, who lives in the spirit, and a natural person, who lives in the soul, a fleshly, or fleshy, person lives in the lusts of the flesh 1 Cor 3:1, 3; 2:14 .</S>
