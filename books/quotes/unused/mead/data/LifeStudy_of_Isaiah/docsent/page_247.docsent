   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE EXALTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus far in Isaiah 51 and 52 we have seen both Israel's return and Israel's restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After their return and their restoration, Israel still needs to know Christ further.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus far the redeemed, returned, and restored people of God know Christ only as the arm of Jehovah and as the reigning God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This knowledge is very good, but it is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's people still need to know Christ in the New Testament sense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The section of the word in the Old Testament from Isaiah 52:13 through Isaiah 53 is a portion that is absolutely in the New Testament sense with the New Testament tone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From my youth, every time I read Isaiah 53 I had the sense that this was a New Testament chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The returned and restored Israel still has not come to know Christ in the New Testament sense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They still do not know how Christ died an all-inclusive and vicarious death and then was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 53 gives us a full record of Christ's death, including a description of the environment of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It tells us how God put all our sins upon Him v. 6 , how He was brought like a lamb to the slaughter v. 7 , and how after His death He was buried v. 9 and then resurrected v. 10b . All these things are in the New Testament, but the Old Testament elect did not know these things, and even the Jewish people today do not know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They know Jehovah, they know the power of Jehovah, they know the strength of Jehovah, and they know the arm of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In their praises to God for the exodus, they did not speak much about the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They praised God mainly for His power; very rarely did they praise God for the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that the Jews know God in His power, they know God in His arm, but they do not know God in His New Testament redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not know that God became a man, that He died and resurrected, and that He has now become a life-giving Spirit to enter into His elect and dwell in them as the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, there is the need of another portion in Isaiah to reveal to them the New Testament Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A. He Will Act Wisely and Will Prosper</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaiah 52:13a says that Jesus will act wisely and will prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After His ascension to the heavens, Jesus has been acting prudently and wisely on this earth, and in whatever He has done He has prospered.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although many attacks have come upon Him, none of these attacks has frustrated Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Communism tried to frustrate Christ for seventy years, but it was not successful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A recent newspaper article reported that in the parliament of Soviet Russia an announcement was made that Russia no longer wanted atheism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now, the emptied Russians want the Bible, God, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I left Communist China forty-two years ago, there were at the most approximately four million Chinese Christians, including Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today in China there are more than fifty million believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more they are oppressed, the more Christians rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ acts wisely and prosperously.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who can frustrate Him?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, the book of Acts is not a record of the acts of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a record of the acts of Christ in the heavens through the apostles in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The acts of the apostle Paul were the acts of Christ, and they were carried out wisely and prosperously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today no one can defeat Jesus Christ.</S>
