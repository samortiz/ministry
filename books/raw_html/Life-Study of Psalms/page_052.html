<P>Psalm 16, on the other hand, is a psalm revealing the God-man, Christ. Psalm 16:1 does not say, "Preserve Me, O God, for I keep the law, and I meditate in the law day and night." This is absolutely wrong. Psalm 16:1 says, "Preserve Me, O God, for I take refuge in You." It was as if the psalmist said, "I don't care for the law; I care for You and I enjoy You." Then Psalm 16:2 continues, "O My soul, you say to Jehovah, You are My Lord;/No good have I beyond You." When the Lord Jesus was a man on this earth, He always held such an attitude of recognizing God the Father as His Lord. His attitude toward the Father could have been expressed by His saying, "I do not have anything beyond You which is good. I have no blessing, no pleasure, and no enjoyment other than You."</P><P>Verse 3 says, "To the saints who are on the earth and to the excellent,/All My delight is in them." The Lord Jesus loved God the Father. He also had His delight in the saints, in the believers, in the members of His Body. He did not delight in the commandments of the law, but in the members of His Body, the saints in God's kingdom.</P><P>Verse 4 says, "Sorrows will be multiplied to them who bartered for some other god;/Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,/Nor will I take up their names upon My lips." Their names refers to the names of the idols, the names of the other gods.</P><P>Verse 5 says, "Jehovah is the portion of My inheritance and of My cup;/You maintain My lot." God is the portion of two things: of the inheritance and of the cup. The inheritance refers to the substance of the lot, and the cup refers to the enjoyment of God as our blessing. At the Lord's table, we drink the cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16a). Stanza 3 of Hymns, #223 points out that in this cup God is our portion. Thus, we have God as the portion for our inheritance and for our enjoyment. God the Father was the very portion of these two things to Christ as a man on this earth. Verse 5b says, "You maintain My lot." The lot is the portion of the inheritance.</P><P>Verse 6a says, "The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for Me." To understand this verse, we have to read Psalm 2:8, which says that God will give to Christ the nations as His inheritance and the limits of the earth as His possession. The limits are the measuring lines of God in His divine economy. God has measured the earth. Whatever God has measured will be Christ's possession. The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for Christ.</P><P>Today the whole earth is not a pleasant place, not a place of pleasure. Even though people are trying to have their amusements, that is not the real pleasure. The earth today is a messy earth, not a pleasant earth. In Genesis 2 the earth was a pleasant garden, but after the fall of man, this pleasant garden became a messy earth. But when the earth will be measured and given to Christ, it will become a pleasant earth. Verse 6b says, "Indeed the inheritance is beautiful to Me." All the nations with the earth will be not only pleasant but also beautiful to Christ as the man who inherited God's inheritance.</P>
