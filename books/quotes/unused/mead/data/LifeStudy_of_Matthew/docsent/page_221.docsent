   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Kingdom People</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The behavior of the scribes and Pharisees is in contrast to the humility of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kingdom people must be the exact opposite of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, in verse 8 the Lord says, But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers, This indicates that Christ is our only teacher and master.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 9 says, And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He Who is in the heavens.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verses 11 and 12 we see that the greater among us should be our servants, that whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and that whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The First Woe</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 13 says, But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut the kingdom of the heavens in the face of men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Pharisees shut up the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They neither entered in themselves nor allowed those who were entering in to enter.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They do not have the heart to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, and at the same time they do not allow those who desire to enter in to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nearly all the opposition against us comes not from unbelievers, but from devoted Christians who desire to frustrate those who want to come this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the eyes of the Lord this is a most subtle thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Second Woe</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 14 says, Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore, you shall receive greater condemnation.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 15 says, Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you compass the sea and the land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twofold more the son of Gehenna than yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This also happens today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Far East I observed that the Catholics made proselytes of some Buddhists only to make them twofold more a son of Gehenna than themselves.</S>
