   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Responding with Excuses</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 6 tells us that to God's call Jeremiah responded with excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Saying That He Did Not Know How to Speak</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Then I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>/ Behold, I do not know how to speak" v. 6a . Jeremiah seemed to be saying, "Lord, how can I be a prophet? I do not know how to speak!" Many of the saints in the Lord's recovery today offer such an excuse for not functioning in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they are encouraged to prophesy in the meetings, they may say that they do not know how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Saying That He Was a Youth</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jeremiah also excused himself by saying, "I am a youth" v. 6b . He felt that he was too young to be a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some of the new ones among us may have the same feeling about speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To such a person God would say, "You are not too young.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as you have been born of Me and baptized, you are not too young to speak for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God does not regard as legitimate the excuse that we do not know how to speak or the excuse that we are too young.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. Affirmed by Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verses 7 and 8 Jehovah affirmed Jeremiah's call.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"But Jehovah said to me, / Do not say, I am a youth; / For everywhere I send you, you shall go; / And everything I command you, you shall speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ Do not be afraid of their faces, / For I am with you to deliver you, declares Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here God seemed to be saying to Jeremiah, "Do not care about human faces.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am with you, and no one is stronger than I or greater than I."</S>
