   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not an organization, but an organism, and this organism is the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A wooden stand is an organization because it is a mere composition of lifeless materials.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But our body is organic, full of life.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, such a church is God's house.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is fully unveiled in 1 Timothy 3:15, where Paul told Timothy that the church is the house of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a church as the house of God, as the family of God, is the manifestation of God in the flesh v. 16 . The church is not only the house as the household, the family, but also the house as a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has a family on this earth, and He is not homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His family becomes His dwelling place.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a great thing it is that today on the earth God has a lodge, a home, a dwelling place!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fifty or sixty years ago, I was teaching the saints about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I told them a number of things about the church, but if you ask me to speak on these matters today, I have no burden.</S>
