   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SECTIONS OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point we need to consider the sections of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord has given us eight words to denote the eight sections of this book: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, transformation, and conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all need to remember these eight words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I had never before seen such an outline of Romans until the Lord gave it to me just recently.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I conducted a thorough study of the book of Romans 22 years ago with the saints in Taiwan, I must declare that the outline I used then is now too old.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The present outline with the eight words denoting the eight sections is new and up-to-date.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must pay close attention to the content of these eight sections.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Introduction the Gospel of God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The introduction 1:1-17 delineates the theme of the book of Romans, which is the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the content of the introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the next message we will see what is the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Condemnation the Need of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Following the introduction, we have the section on condemnation 1:18 3:20 that unveils to us the need of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all are hopeless and helpless cases and are under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Justification The Accomplishment</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The third section, justification 3:21 5:11 , reveals the accomplishment of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Related to this matter of justification we have three other items propitiation, redemption, and reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will cover these terms when we come to chapter 3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At this point I will only say a brief word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s justification depends upon the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the redemption of Christ, God has no way to justify sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, justification depends upon redemption, and redemption has one major aspect propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Propitiation is the major structure of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Propitiation is the major part of the redemption of Christ because, as sinners, we owed God a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were held by God to pay this debt, and this caused a tremendous problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That problem has been resolved by Christ as our propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since this propitiation has solved our problems with God, we have been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Based upon the redemption of Christ, God can easily and lawfully justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, justification depends upon redemption, and the major part of redemption is propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What, then, is reconciliation?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Reconciliation is the issue of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s justification issues in reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of this has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although you may not be clear about all of these words at present, you can say to the Lord, Lord, I don t understand all these terms, but I praise You that everything has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Justification brings us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In fact, it not only brings us to God, but also into God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we may have the full enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The King James Version says, We joy in God Rom 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We not only joy in God; we enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is justification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>D. Sanctification the Life-process</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>in Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Following this, we have sanctification 5:12 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How good it is to be in God and to enjoy God!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, do not look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many times as I was enjoying God, praising Him, and sharing in His riches, the subtle one said to me, Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Think about how you dealt with your wife this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The moment I accepted this suggestion, I descended from heaven to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I was deeply disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While I was in my room praising, my wife was in the kitchen cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Satan raised the question of how I had treated my wife that morning, I was afraid she would hear my praises and come in to stop me, saying, Don t praise anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Don t you know what you did to me this morning?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After being justified, we need to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does it mean to be sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once again we may use the illustration of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we put tea into a glass of plain water, the water will be teaified.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At best, we are plain water, although we are actually not plain, but dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if we are plain water, we lack the tea flavor, the tea essence, and the tea color.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need the tea to come into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ Himself is the heavenly tea.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Recently, I pointed out to the saints in Anaheim that our God is progressively revealed throughout the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In chapter 1 He is God in creation, in chapter 3 God in redemption, in chapter 4 God in justification, in chapter 5 God in reconciliation, and in chapter 6 God in identification.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we come to chapter 8, we see that our God is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ is in us Rom 8:10 !</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is no longer merely in creation, redemption, justification, reconciliation, and identification, but He is now within us, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ is in us doing a transforming and sanctifying work, just as the tea, when put into the water, works the element of tea into it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eventually, the water will be wholly teaified.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It will have the appearance, the flavor, and the taste of real tea.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I serve you some of this beverage, I will be serving you tea, not plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If I were to ask you whether or not you have been justified, you would all reply, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have been justified because Christ has accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God has reconciled us and we are now enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, what about sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Have you been sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If some of the married brothers claim to be sanctified, their wives will disagree, saying, The brothers certainly have been justified, but it is very doubtful that they have been sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brothers, have your wives been sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Wives, do you think that your husbands have been sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some may say that their husbands have been sanctified a small amount.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Others may feel that they are somewhat improved.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, I am not talking about being improved, but being sanctified that is to have Christ wrought into our very being, just as the essence, flavor, and color of the tea are wrought into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is sanctification.</S>
