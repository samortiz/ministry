   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:24, 27-30; Eph 2:20-22 THE BIBLICAL VIEW CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Strictly speaking, the Bible does not use the phrase the organization of the church .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is because the church is not actually an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to spiritual truth, it is wrong to say that the church is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nonetheless, due to the limitation of human understanding, it is necessary to use the term organization so that we can properly explain the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, according to spiritual fact, the church is not an organization, yet for the purpose of explanation and clarification, it seems necessary to use the term organization.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the church is not an organization, it is a living Body, an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, it has an aspect of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A body is an organism, an organic entity, whereas a table is not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A table is made by joining many individual pieces of wood together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is merely an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, our body is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nonetheless, it resembles an organization because outwardly speaking, our body has a structure composed of sinews, joints, blood, flesh, and other elements that have been joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible clearly reveals that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although a physical body looks like an organization, the most important characteristic of a body is not its organization but the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A mere organization has no life within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, both a table and a building are organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of size, they have no life within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A body, on the contrary, is not a mere organization, because it has life within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the church is the Body, its main characteristic is not organization but life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once the life in a body stops functioning, it becomes a dead organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To speak bluntly, when the life within a body is gone, what remains is merely a corpse, and a corpse is merely an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>An organism depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>An entity that has life within is not only an organization but also an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An entity without life is merely an organization and has none of the activities related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason we say that the church is an organism is because it has life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In appearance both a physical body and the church seem to be organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, just as a body is composed of different members, the church as an organism is composed of many living parts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An organism consists not merely of a single part but of many parts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we speak of the Body of Christ without referring to our physical body, it will be difficult for us to understand the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A body is a single organism, yet it has many parts, many constituents, which are mutually joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot say that a body does not have organization; however, it is inaccurate to say that a body is merely an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is an organism with many parts and constituents coordinated and organized together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only does the Bible say that the church is the Body; it also says that the church is a household, a temple of God, and the dwelling place of God 2:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is an aspect of organization in regard to a body and even more in regard to a house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A house is constructed of many parts and elements; hence, it is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the church as a house is not a dead house but a living house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every stone in a physical building is dead because stones lack life, but every stone in the church is living because these stones have life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Peter 2:4-5 says, Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Himself is a living stone, and all of us saved ones are living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are living stones because we have Christ s life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are joined together not merely through outward coordination and arrangement but by inward union and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only are a person s arms and shoulders connected together, but they also share the same life and the same circulation of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, they are not only connected but have also grown together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Glass windows can be installed in a house, but the different parts of the church cannot be installed; instead, they grow together into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, we cannot deny the fact that the church has an aspect of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the Bible does not use the word organization, it often uses related expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For instance, Matthew 16:18 uses the word build.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord wants to build His church on Himself as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ephesians 2:22 says that the saved ones are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Building is something organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without being organized, big piles of wood and stone cannot become a building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After being organized, a piece of wood is located on top of another piece of wood, and a stone is located on top of another stone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that they are built.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why we say that a building is something that involves organization.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes, when we go to a local church, we may sense that there is a heap of stones piled up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may have the feeling that the brothers and sisters have not been built together.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In other words, they have not passed through spiritual organization.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we visit another local church, we may sense that some of the brothers and sisters are being built together and have some spiritual organization.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Others, however, may be like stones being piled up next to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are for the building of the house, but they have not yet been built into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In other words, some saints in the church have not yet passed through spiritual organization.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, even though the Bible does not speak of organization in relation to the church, it does speak of blending, or coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As to the church being a house, it is a building; as to the church being the Body, it is a blending.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First Corinthians 12:24 speaks of the Body of Christ and uses our human body as a metaphor.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It says, God has blended the body together.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since this is a blending, or coordination, it certainly involves organization.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God organizes everyone whom He blends together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we come into the midst of some local churches, we cannot sense a condition of coordination; rather, we sense that what exists is a bunch of people coming together.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They are not in confusion, but neither are they in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that they have not been coordinated together, or organized, by God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, when we come into the midst of saints in another local church, we may sense their spiritual organization, that is, the blending carried out by God, and a beautiful order.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This differs from a locality in which all the saints are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In such a locality the saints may not argue or quarrel with one another but neither are they related to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, blending is the spiritual term, whereas organization is the human term.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is yet a third term that the Bible uses placed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>First Corinthians 12:28 says that what God has placed in the church is not merely one type of person but many types of people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some are apostles, some are prophets, some are teachers, some are helpers, and some are administrators v. 28 . God has placed all these different types of people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To use words that we can more easily understand, to be placed means to be organized.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God s placing is His arrangement, and an arrangement is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The gifted ones do not serve in a disorganized way, each doing his own thing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The apostles, prophets, and teachers do not serve independently.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They do not speak their own thing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God s placing is orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In 1 Corinthians 12:28 there is a specific order.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>First there are apostles, second there are prophets, and third there are teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is very orderly.</S>
