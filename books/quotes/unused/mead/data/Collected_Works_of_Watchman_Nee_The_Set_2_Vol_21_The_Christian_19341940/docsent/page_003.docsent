   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WASTE AND PRAGMATISM Issue No. 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:6-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have spoken twice on this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many significances to this portion of the Scripture, and I will not repeat what I have said.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Last Monday evening during the Bible study meeting, I said that, the Lord willing, we would specifically speak on this passage on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, we will spend some time on this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This portion of the Word is on the story of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in this Gospel, her name is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the other Gospels, her name is mentioned; therefore, we know that this woman is Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does Matthew mention her only as a woman?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It shows us that what she did can be done by any ordinary woman; it was not something that could be done only by someone called Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The use of the word woman means that it does not refer to any person in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, the fact that she is only mentioned anonymously as a woman shows that the person does not mean much; it is the Lord who is worthy of our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that Mary did not have a servant at home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was no one else in her house except her sister, Martha, and her brother, Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She served the Lord personally.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also know that she did not have a rich family.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it is an amazing thing that she bought a pound of ointment of pure nard we are told of this in the other Gospels , and the pure nard was "very valuable" John 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, this ointment must have been very expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps one cannot even find such expensive ointment today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When she poured the ointment on Jesus' head, she was criticized by many.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They murmured that it was a waste of three hundred denarii to anoint the head of the Lord, and that the money could have been given to the poor and taken care of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the Lord said, "Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her" Matt 26:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, I believe that wherever the gospel is preached, the story of Mary is to be preached also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It would not be proper to preach the gospel without speaking about the story of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as there is the gospel, there should be the story of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, after a man understands the gospel, he should also know the story of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unfortunately, the gospel is preached in many places, but the story of Mary is not preached.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some wonder why three hundred denarii are so important.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the Lord was sold for three hundred denarii, Mary's three hundred denarii had a tremendous significance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not misunderstand when I say that the gospel was worth three hundred denarii and the enemy's valuation of the Lord Jesus was also three hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord was worth three hundred denarii only in the eyes of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since a flask of ointment was worth three hundred denarii, Mary sold herself for three hundred denarii worth of ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Putting it in another way, Mary was that flask of ointment; she put herself into that flask and sold herself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The story of Mary must be spoken of wherever the gospel is preached because every time the gospel is preached, there is the need of the story of Mary to maintain the balance of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is a place which only preaches the gospel without mentioning the story of Mary, the truth is unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is easy for men to preach the gospel without mentioning the story of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is possible for the gospel to be preached too much without having the proper balance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Preaching the gospel is easy today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gospel preached among us and everywhere in the world is a gospel that satisfies men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man believes in the gospel because he wants to profit, rejoice, live well, and gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we profit, rejoice, live well, and gain something, we feel satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people believe in Christ only to be saved from death and hell and to receive eternal life and go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people have not believed in Christ to the extent that they give themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many preach the gospel by telling others that they can pass from death to life, and from judgment to eternal life and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Men like to hear this kind of gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if you tell them that after they have believed, they should offer themselves to God, obey God, and be His prisoners and slaves, they would refuse to accept.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people see salvation only as deliverance from judgment; they have not seen that salvation is also deliverance from self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The salvation of many people is merely a salvation from hell; they have not seen that salvation is also a deliverance from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people only see that being saved is receiving eternal life and blessing; they have not seen that being saved is for the Lord to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they realized that salvation is a matter of putting oneself absolutely in the hand of the Lord, many would turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This distinction was present at the time of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was recorded in the Gospel of Luke, which speaks of a man preparing a great feast and asking servants to invite the lame and crippled to come to the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the feast of the gospel, and many people came to the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord spreads a feast before man, and whosoever will may come.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Indeed men came.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible says that many people walked with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They thought that the gospel was wonderful because it was a word of grace out of the mouth of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the Lord told them that if they would not take up their cross to follow Him, they could not be His disciples, and that if they loved their parents more than they loved Him, they were not worthy to be His disciples, or if they would not leave behind everything in this world, they could not be His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord mentioned His relationship with us immediately after He preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people consider salvation as merely a deliverance from judgment and hell; they do not have Christ's concept.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many believe in Christ, not because Christ is believable, but because He is one of the ways for them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many believe in Christ, not because they realize that Christ is the goal, but because they think that through Christ they can go to God and heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus says that He is the way, the truth, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many believe that Christ is the way, the method.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But they do not see that Christ is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They think that they should trust in Christ because He is a wonderful way for them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many people want to come to God, go to heaven, or be saved through Christ; but they have not seen that Christ is the life and the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many people want to go to heaven, be delivered from punishment, and be saved, but they cannot do it on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, they ask Christ for help.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ is the means and not the goal for them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In other words, Christ is the means of salvation through which they reach their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The person, Christ, is not their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Believing in Christ and being saved are only means, not the goals, for them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They do not understand what Christ wants to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the danger of the gospel among us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why there is the need to speak of the story of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not enough to hear and believe in the gospel; we must smell the aroma of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Salvation is not for ourselves but for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is what the story of Mary is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In a Sunday School, a man asked a group of children once: "Who among you would want to be Lazarus?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Who would want to be the rich man?"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some children said that they wanted to be Lazarus because they would enjoy the blessing in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some said that they wanted to be the rich man because they did not know what would happen in the future anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One child said that he wanted to be the rich man when he was alive and Lazarus when he died.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many Christians think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They want to enjoy blessing while they live on earth, and enjoy blessing when they die.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They want to come out ahead in both worlds.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the way many Christians want to take today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But those who are like Mary are a Lazarus when they are alive and Lazarus when they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They draw near to God after they die in the same way that they drew near to Him when they were alive.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Just as they put the world aside when they die, they put the world aside while they are yet living.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They are Lazarus when they die, and they are Lazarus when they are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is what the story of Mary is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We are not neglecting the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We know that we should pay attention to the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But the Lord Jesus said if there are thousands or tens of thousands of places where the gospel is preached, the story of Mary should be told also.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A danger exists if one only preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is why the story of Mary must be told.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>On the one hand, we have to preach the gospel, but on the other hand, we must offer up everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Paul said, "We have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died" 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But it does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Following this, Paul said, "And He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised" v. 15 . This was what Mary did.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Lord is the One who has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The purpose of His death and resurrection for us is that we may live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>No Christian can just be saved, but not have to suffer tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Paul said that we are not only appointed to believe in the Lord Jesus; we are also appointed to suffer for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should know that we have been set apart to believe in the Lord and also set apart to suffer for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Many believe in the Lord Jesus only to the extent that they receive happiness from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>They have not believed to the extent that they will suffer for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Many people do not know what it is to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>To believe in Christ is to believe in Him to the extent that we suffer for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But thank the Lord that this suffering is precious!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Many have believed in the Lord Jesus only for the purpose of going to heaven; they have not believed to the extent that they go out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They have believed only to the extent that they are accepted by God; they have not believed to the extent that they are rejected by men.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But a perfected believer, one who belongs absolutely to Christ, is one who believes in the Lord to the extent that he is both accepted by God and rejected by men.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is why the story of Mary must follow the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We must speak of the story of Mary today.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>There are many who have believed in the gospel today, but there are not many who are like Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>May there be not only those who believe in the gospel, but those who believe in the gospel as Mary did.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>"A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table" Matt 26:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>According to Mark, she broke her alabaster flask and anointed the Lord's head.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>After she did this, Judas took the lead to condemn it as a reckless waste of God's gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>She had wasted three hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He thought this sum of money could be used for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The ointment could have been sold for three hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>What kind of intention was this?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>What was the motive behind this?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Mary poured the ointment on the Lord instead.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>What kind of intention was this?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>And what was the motive behind this?</S>
