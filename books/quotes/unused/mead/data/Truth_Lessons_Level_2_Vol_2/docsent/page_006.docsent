   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Adam and Eve were created by God as the first couple among the human race and as the first ancestors of all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Adam was created according to God s inward image and outward likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was God s image for the purpose of declaring God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God established Adam as His deputy, one who would exercise His authority, especially to have dominion over the earth in order to deal with His enemy, Satan, and restrict Satan s movement on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Adam, who was created as the head of mankind, is a type of Christ as the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Adam was the first man; Christ is the second Man and also the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Adam was created, all mankind, being included in him, was created as God s vessel that man might receive God as his life and content and become God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and thereby included all his descendants in his sinning and becoming fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, Satan and the sinful nature entered into all mankind, and all men were constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Immediately after Adam sinned and fell, God came to seek him and to give him the promise of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Adam believed and received this promise and was then able to continue to live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through Eve, whom he considered as one who was qualified to have life and live, Adam begot generation after generation of descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, he, including all his descendants, was driven by God out of the garden of Eden and was separated from the tree of life, until Christ came to accomplish God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eve was made out of a rib taken from Adam s body and was unto Adam to be Adam s counterpart and to be one flesh with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This signifies that the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, and that the church is the counterpart of Christ and is one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since Eve came out of Adam, she was part of Adam; she was the overflow of Adam as Adam s increase.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies that the church is part of Christ as Christ s increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, Eve did not keep her position in God s creation and did not take her husband as her head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, she fell into the devil s scheme and violated God s prohibition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, she seduced her husband to follow her in eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, all mankind was brought into sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, Eve kept her position in receiving the promise of God s redemption; she followed Adam, her head, and received God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way she was delivered from the position of death and became the mother of all living.</S>
