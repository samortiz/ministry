   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Redemption in the New Testament 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Propitiation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The expiation in the Old Testament was a type of the propitiation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Propitiation is mentioned at least five times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 we are told that Christ, the Son of God, is Himself the propitiation for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In both places the word propitiation actually means a sacrifice and should be rendered propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word in these verses is hilasmos, which means that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 the Lord Jesus is the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another Greek word regarding propitiation, hilasterion, is found in Hebrews 9:5 and Romans 3:25.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hilasterion means the place where propitiation was made.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The proper reference books indicate that the word hilasterion in these two verses means the place of propitiation, and the King James Version renders it as mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, hilasterion is the word for the term mercy seat in Exodus 25 and Leviticus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, hilasterion is the place of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, in Hebrews 2:17 is the word hilaskomai, the verbal form of the noun hilasmos.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The King James Version translates hilaskomai as make reconciliation for ; however, it should be translated propitiate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ propitiates for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The matter of propitiation is mentioned five times in the New Testament in relation to Christ: twice it refers to Christ Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice, twice it refers to the place where propitiation was accomplished, and once it refers to the action of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition to these five references to propitiation in the New Testament, we find the same root used by the publican in his prayer in the temple Luke 18:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the King James Version, the publican prayed, God, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the Greek means, Propitiate for me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The publican actually was saying, O God, propitiate for me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am sinful in Your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I need propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the meaning of propitiation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How shall we distinguish it from redemption on the one hand and reconciliation on the other?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will discover that reconciliation includes propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, there is a difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Propitiation means that you have a problem with another person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have either offended him or else you owe him something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For instance, if I wrong you or am otherwise in debt to you, a problem exists between us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of this problem or debt, you have a demand upon me, and unless your demand is satisfied the problem between us cannot be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, there is the need for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word hilasmos implies that I have wronged you and that now I am indebted to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a problem between us that hinders our relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Propitiation, therefore, involves two parties, one of which has wronged the other, has become indebted to the other, and must act to satisfy the demands of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the offending party is to appease the offended party, he must fulfill his demands.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Septuagint uses the word hilasmos for the word atonement in Leviticus 25:9 and Numbers 5:8 because this Greek word means to conciliate two parties and make them one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a matter of atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word atone is composed of two words, at and one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may write the word atonement this way: at-one-ment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Atonement is at-one-ment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The meaning of atonement is to bring two parties into one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When two parties have been separated and seek to be in oneness, there is the need for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The action of propitiation is atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Propitiation means to make us one with God because there had been a separation between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What was the problem that kept us from God, that made it impossible to have direct fellowship with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The problem was our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our sins kept us away from God s presence and hindered God from coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we needed propitiation to appease God s demands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ accomplished this on the cross when He offered Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the cross He propitiated for us and brought us back to God, making us one with God.</S>
