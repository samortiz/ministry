<p class="bold">WEEK 15 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 20:17-21</h2><p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them,</p><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to <sup>1</sup>death,</p><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;And deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised.</p> <p>20 &nbsp;Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him.</p> <p>21 &nbsp;And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>18<sup>1</sup> This was the third time the Lord revealed His death to the disciples. The first was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration (16:13, 21). The second was in Galilee, after His transfiguration (17:22). This third time was on the way to Jerusalem. This revelation was a prophecy, altogether strange to the natural concept of the disciples; yet it would be fulfilled literally, in every detail.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>It seems to me rather unusual that after the definition of the kingdom reward the Lord would once again unveil His crucifixion and resurrection. Apparently this has no significance. However, if you get into the depth of this book, you will see that this is a very significant continuation. In order to receive the kingdom reward, we need to experience the cross and the resurrection.…Apart from experiencing the Lord’s cross and resurrection, it is impossible to experience the Lord’s life for the reward of the kingdom. In Philippians 3 Paul said that for Christ’s sake he counted all things as refuse. Then he said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ’s death. Paul had an adequate understanding of the Lord’s death and resurrection. This understanding is for us to experience Christ as our life for the kingdom. For the kingdom reward, we need the experience of the Lord’s crucifixion and resurrection.</p><p>What was the disciples’ reaction to the Lord’s full unveiling of His crucifixion and resurrection? They did not say, “Amen, Lord. The first and second times we didn’t see this. Thank You, Lord, for taking us aside this time and purposely telling us about this. Now we realize that You must pass through death and resurrection. No doubt this includes all of us. Eventually, we also shall experience this wonderful death and resurrection.” The disciples definitely did not react like this. Rather, verses 20 and 21 say, “Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him. And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.” The mother of the sons of Zebedee was the Lord’s aunt, His mother’s sister, and Zebedee’s sons, James and John, were His cousins. Thus, there was a natural relationship between them and the Lord. Immediately after the Lord had unveiled His death and resurrection for the third time, the mother of James and John came to Him asking that her two sons might sit on His right hand and left hand in the kingdom. Although the Lord had spoken of the crucifixion and the resurrection, their mind was set on the throne. Often we are exactly like James and John. Again and again they heard about the crucifixion and the resurrection. But in them and in their mother there was the desire for the throne. This is the ambition for position.…This was their reaction to the Lord’s word about His death and resurrection.
