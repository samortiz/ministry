<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(15)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 17:1-10, 22-24; 7:39; 12:23, 28; 13:31-32; 14:13; 15:8</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the mysterious sign of the divine glorification. In order to know the significance of this sign, we need to understand what glory is. According to the natural human concept, glory is related to having a high position with honor. For example, a man wins an election for the office of President, and now he has the glory of occupying this high, honorable position. However, we should set aside this natural concept of glory when we read about glory in the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPRESSION OF THE DIVINE LIFE WITH ITS NATURE</h2><p>According to the Scriptures, glory is the expression of the divine life with its nature. Let us once again use a carnation seed as an illustration. A carnation seed does not have any glory. After such a seed is sown into the soil, it will grow into a plant, and eventually this plant will blossom. The blossoming of a carnation flower is the expression of the glory concealed in the life and nature of a carnation seed. A carnation seed has its particular life and nature. When this life and nature are released through the blossoming of the flower, we see the glory of a carnation plant. The carnation blossom is the glory, and this glory is the expression of the life and nature of a carnation plant. Although the blossom is the glory, the blossoming is the glorification of the carnation plant. In other words, when a carnation blossoms, it is glorified. Here we have both the glory and the glorification of the carnation plant.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD’S PRAYER CONCERNING HIS GLORIFICATION</h2><p>According to John 17:1, the Lord Jesus prayed, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.” Here we see glorification as the subject of the Lord’s prayer. He was God incarnate, and His flesh was a tabernacle for God’s dwelling on earth (John 1:14). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God’s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory (Matt. 17:1-4). But it was concealed again in His flesh. Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord had indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him (John 12:23; 13:31-32). The Lord knew that He would pass through death that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken so that His divine element, His divine life, might be released. He would also resurrect so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed. Then His entire being, both divinity and humanity, would be glorified. In this way the Father would be glorified in Him.<p>In John 17:5 the Lord Jesus went on to say, “And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.” Before His incarnation, the Lord as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father. But when He put on flesh through incarnation, this glory was concealed in His flesh. His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him. The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and the divine nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord’s humanity. Outwardly, He appeared to be a Jew, even a despised Galilean and a Nazarene. This was the appearance of the shell of the Lord’s humanity. But within this shell the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory were confined and concealed. As the Lord lived, walked, and worked among the people, His disciples saw in Him something that had never been seen by men before. Yes, the Lord who lived among them was a man, but He lived in such a way that He expressed God. He expressed God’s life and nature. What the disciples saw in the Lord Jesus was the expression of the divine life and nature that were within Him. In his Gospel the Apostle John regards this expression as glorification.<p>According to John 17:6 the Lord said to the Father, “I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me.” The Son came and worked in the Father’s name (5:43; 10:25) to manifest the Father to those whom the Father had given Him and to make the Father’s name known to them (17:26). Actually, for the Lord to make known to them the Father’s name was for Him to express the Father in His divine life and nature. The Lord lived among the disciples in such a way that He expressed the Father, and this expression was a matter of glorification.
