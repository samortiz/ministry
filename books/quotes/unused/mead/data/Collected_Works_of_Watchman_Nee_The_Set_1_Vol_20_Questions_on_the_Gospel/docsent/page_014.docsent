   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the personal virtue of Christ while He lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ becoming righteousness means that God gives Christ to us, making Him our righteousness.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of the five offerings, the righteousness of Christ is equivalent to the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The meal offering contains no blood because it signifies the living, good conduct, and virtue of the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sin offering is offered as the propitiation for the sin of our entire life, and the trespass offering is offered for our daily sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two offerings deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The burnt offering causes God to consider us as good as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Old Testament uses the phrase "Jehovah our righteousness" Jer 33:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that God Himself is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With Christ as our righteousness, we can answer all of God's demands.</S>
