We need to magnify Christ under any kind of circumstance. Philippians 1:20 says, "According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death." Paul said that he was magnifying Christ, as always, through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is altogether under God's operating.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By Holding Forth the Word of Life,<br>as Luminaries Shining in This Age</H2><P>We live Christ for His magnification by holding forth the word of life (Phil. 2:15-16a). To hold forth is to apply, to present, or to offer. To hold forth the word of life is to present the word of life to people as an offering, a contribution. Our Christian life is a life of holding forth the word of life to present it to others as an offering, a contribution. We hold forth the word of life as luminaries shining in this age (v. 15). As to our location, we are in the world; as to our condition, we are in this age. This age is corrupt, dark, evil, and perverted. But we are on this earth shining in this age as luminaries to reflect the divine light of Christ. A luminary does not have light in itself, but it reflects the light of the sun. We are luminaries who have no light in ourselves. We reflect the light of the sun (Christ). This is what it means to live Christ for His magnification. We hold forth the word of life as luminaries shining in this age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Work Out Our Salvation</H2><P>Our holding forth the word of life is to work out our salvation, to carry out our salvation (Phil. 2:12). Paul tells us to work out our own salvation, and then he mentions that we need to do all things without murmurings and reasonings (v. 14). As we have pointed out, both murmurings and reasonings frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent. We need to carry out our salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling. We have received this salvation by faith, but now we must carry it out by obedience. To receive it by faith is once for all, whereas to carry it out is lifelong.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
