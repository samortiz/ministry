<h1 class="title">The Church in the Triune God<br />
(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:1, 3-6, 10; 2 Thes. 1:1</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The New Testament, like the Bible as a whole, is fully composed of and structured with the Divine Trinity&mdash;Matt. 28:19; Rev. 1:4-5; 22:1-2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The entire New Testament is related to the Triune God; the Triune God is the element for the construction of the New Testament&mdash;Eph. 3:16-19; 4:4-6.</li>
	<li>The Bible presents us a picture of the move of the Divine Trinity for the accomplishment of His economy&mdash;Luke 15:3-32; Eph. 2:18.</li>
	<li>The Bible was written according to the governing principle of the Triune God wrought into His chosen and redeemed people as their enjoyment, their drink, and their fountain of life and light&mdash;Psa. 36:8-9.</li>
	<li>The revelation concerning the Triune God in the Word of God is for the dispensing of God in His Divine Trinity into His chosen and redeemed people for their experience and enjoyment so that they might become His corporate expression for eternity&mdash;Eph. 1:3-23; 4:16; Rev. 21:2, 10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 1 Thessalonians 1, the Triune God is revealed in His triune work&mdash;vv. 1, 3-6, 10; 2 Thes. 1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Father selected us (1 Thes. 1:1, 3-4), the Son delivers us (v. 10), and the Holy Spirit propagates, imparts, and transmits the Triune God into us (vv. 5-6); such a triune work is for our enjoyment of His salvation.</li>
	<li>This portion shows the activity of the Divine Trinity in the service of the gospel:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The believers are beloved of God the Father&mdash;vv. 1, 4.</li>
		<li>After the believers receive the gospel in the power of the Spirit and with the joy of the Spirit, they become imitators of the Lord&mdash;vv. 5-6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Epistle of 1 Thessalonians is addressed to &ldquo;the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;&mdash;1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>On the one hand, the church of the Thessalonians was of the Thessalonians; on the other hand, this church was in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Such a church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is organically united with the Lord Jesus Christ in all that He is and has done&mdash;John 1:12-13; 1 Cor. 1:30; 6:17.</li>
		<li>We need to see that the church is composed of human beings who are in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ, those who have the life of God and who are in the organic union with Christ&mdash;John 3:15; 15:1, 5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When Paul speaks of the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, he actually means that the church is in the Triune God&mdash;1 Thes. 1:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The expressions <em>God the Father</em> and <em>the Lord Jesus Christ</em> both imply the Spirit; therefore, in 1 Thessalonians 1:1 the Spirit is implied and understood, and we may speak of the church being in the Triune God.</li>
		<li>Because the three of the Divine Trinity are inseparable, whenever we have the first, the Father, we also have the second, the Son, and the third, the Spirit&mdash;Matt. 12:28; Rom. 8:11; Gal. 4:4-6.</li>
		<li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, not three; They are distinct but not separate&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We cannot separate the Son from the Father, or the Father and the Son from the Spirit, because all three coexist and coinhere&mdash;John 14:10-11.</li>
			<li>In Their eternal coexistence the three of the Godhead are distinct, but Their eternal coinherence makes Them one.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the divine economy the three of the Divine Trinity work and are manifested respectively in three consecutive stages&mdash;Eph. 1:3-14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Father is the One who plans, originates, and initiates&mdash;vv. 3-6.</li>
			<li>The Son accomplishes everything that the Father has planned, originated, and initiated&mdash;vv. 7-12.</li>
			<li>The Spirit executes and applies what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished&mdash;vv. 13-14.</li>
			<li>Selection is of the Father, deliverance is of the Son, and imparting, or propagating, is of the Spirit&mdash;1 Thes. 1:3-6, 10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>When the Son comes, He comes with the Father and by the Spirit; the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit comes as the Son with the Father&mdash;John 14:26; 15:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the church to be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ means that the church is in the processed Triune God&mdash;Matt. 28:19; Eph. 4:4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>According to the Bible, there is no such thing as the church being merely in God; rather, the church is in the processed Triune God&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
		<li>In Genesis 1 God was the unprocessed God, but in the New Testament He has become the processed Triune God&mdash;John 7:37-39; Phil. 1:19.</li>
		<li><em>Processed</em> refers to the crucial steps through which the Triune God has passed in the divine economy: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In crucifixion the Lord accomplished redemption, the termination of the old creation, and the destruction of Satan&mdash;Eph. 1:7; Rom. 6:6; Heb. 2:14.</li>
			<li>In resurrection He germinated the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
			<li>Now He is the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The church in the processed Triune God is the church in the One who has become the life-giving Spirit with the Father and the Son&mdash;John 14:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The processed Triune God reaches us, contacts us, and is applied to us in our experience as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			<li>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us&mdash;John 14:10-11, 16-17, 20.</li>
			<li>When we are in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, we are in the Spirit; thus, we are the church in the processed Triune God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we see the vision of the church in the Triune God, this vision will control our thinking, our activities, and our entire life&mdash;Prov. 29:18a; Acts 26:19.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:1, 3-6, 10; 2 Thes. 1:1</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The church is in God the Father&mdash;1 Thes. 1:1; 2 Thes. 1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>For the church to be in God the Father, God must become the Father to us, and we need to have a life relationship with Him&mdash;John 20:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In a way that is organic and full of life, God the Father has made it possible for the church to be in Him&mdash;1 John 5:11.</li>
		<li>In the New Testament, especially in the Gospel of John, the Father denotes the source of life&mdash;5:26.</li>
		<li>The title <em>God</em> refers to creation; the title <em>Father</em> refers to the impartation of life and indicates a relationship of life&mdash;20:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Father, the source of life, is for the propagation and multiplication of life&mdash;1 John 3:1.</li>
			<li>God is no longer merely our Creator; He is also our Father, our Begetter, for He has begotten us with His life&mdash;John 1:12-13.</li>
			<li>We call God our Father because we have been born of Him, and now, as His children, we have a life relationship with Him&mdash;Rom. 8:15-16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Through His life-releasing death and life-imparting resurrection, the Lord has made us, His believers, one with Him; thus, His Father is now our Father&mdash;John 20:17.</li>
		<li>By His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus has brought us into Himself; since He is in the Father, we are in the Father by being in Him&mdash;14:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church in God the Father is a composition of the sons of God&mdash;Heb. 2:10-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The New Testament reveals that God wants many sons and that He has predestinated us unto sonship&mdash;Gal. 3:26; 4:4-6; Eph. 1:5.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s good pleasure, the desire of His heart, is to have many sons for the expression of His Son&mdash;Matt. 5:45; Gal. 1:15-16; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the church to be in God the Father means that the church is in the One who is the unique source, Originator, and Initiator&mdash;1 Cor. 8:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This implies that the church is in God&rsquo;s purpose, plan, selection, and predestination&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9, 11; 3:11.</li>
		<li>To know God as the Father is to know that everything originates from Him and that everything proceeds from Him&mdash;Matt. 15:13; Rom. 11:36.</li>
		<li>In the church life the Father should be the unique source, and we all should be in His unique purpose and plan&mdash;2 Tim. 1:9; Rom. 8:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the church life, we need to have the loving, receiving, and forgiving heart of our Father God&mdash;Luke 15:11-32.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church is in the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;1 Thes. 1:1; 2 Thes. 1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Jesus Christ becomes our Lord, we are in Him, organically united to Him&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; 6:17; John 15:5.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament, the name Jesus refers primarily to the Lord in His experiences from incarnation to resurrection&mdash;Matt. 1:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus is the name of the Lord with respect to His humanity; this name denotes His life experiences and the things He passed through before His resurrection&mdash;2 Cor. 4:10-11; Eph. 4:21.</li>
		<li>Jesus means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah our salvation&rdquo;; for Jehovah to become our Savior and our salvation, it was necessary for Him to pass through a long process&mdash;Matt. 1:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The title <em>Christ</em> refers to what the Lord is in resurrection and to His experiences, position, life, and actions after His resurrection&mdash;Acts 2:36:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Christ, the anointed One, the Lord Jesus has been appointed and commissioned by God to accomplish His eternal purpose&mdash;Matt. 16:16.</li>
		<li>The church is in Christ, who in His resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In Christian experience, Christ is identical to the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17a.</li>
			<li>By the Spirit, with the Spirit, through the Spirit, and in the Spirit, we are in Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>To be in Christ is to be terminated and buried, for to be in Christ is to be in His death, where all the negative things&mdash;sin, the flesh, the self, the old man, the natural life, the world, death, and Satan&mdash;have been terminated&mdash;Rom. 6:4-5.</li>
		<li>The title <em>Christ</em> implies all the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection; thus, to be in Christ is to be in resurrection&mdash;v. 4; 8:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>According to the New Testament, the title <em>Lord</em> is all-inclusive&mdash;Phil. 2:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This title applies to the entire life and ministry of the Lord Jesus.</li>
		<li>As the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One, Jesus Christ has been made the Lord of all; all this process and everything related to it is implied in the title <em>Lord</em>&mdash;Acts 10:36; Rom. 10:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Seeing that the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ is basic to living a holy life for the church life&mdash;1 Thes. 1:1; 4:7; 5:23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we see that the church is an entity in the Triune God, we will realize that we have been absolutely separated by God Himself and are now encompassed by the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2, 30.</li>
	<li>To be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ is to be in sanctification:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Only when we are in the Triune God are we truly separated unto God from everything other than God&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23.</li>
		<li>This makes us a holy people, living a holy, separated life; this life is for the church&mdash;3:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ should be composed of those who are increasing and abounding in love to one another and to all men&mdash;v. 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ is characterized by this increasing and abounding love&mdash;Phil. 2:2; 1 Pet. 1:22.</li>
	<li>If we truly are a church in the Triune God, the love we have for one another will increase and abound&mdash;2 Pet. 1:7; 1 John 4:7, 11; 5:1.</li>

<h1 class="title">Faith, Love, and Hope&mdash;<br />
the Structure of a Holy Life for the Church Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:2-3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Faith, love, and hope are the structure of a holy life for the church life, which is the genuine Christian life and the content of Paul&rsquo;s first Epistle to the Thessalonians&mdash;1:2-3; 1 Cor. 13:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Faith is the nature and strength of the work; love, the motivation for and characteristic of labor; and hope, the source of endurance&mdash;1 Thes. 1:3.</li>
	<li>Faith is toward God (v. 8), love is toward the saints (3:12; 4:9-10), and hope is in the Lord&rsquo;s coming (2:19).</li>
	<li>To turn to God from the idols is accomplished by faith infused into the new converts through their hearing of the word of the gospel; to serve a living and true God is by love produced within the believers by the Triune God as the all-inclusive Supplier who lives in them; to await the Son of God from the heavens is the hope that strengthens the believers to stand steadfastly in their faith&mdash;1:3, 9-10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The work of faith is the foundation of our Christian life and service&mdash;v. 3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>faith</em> refers both to the things the believers believe in (the objective faith&mdash;Eph. 4:13; 1 Tim. 1:19b; 2 Tim. 4:7) and to the believing action of the believers (the subjective faith&mdash;Gal. 2:20).</li>
	<li>The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith&mdash;Rom. 3:22 and note 1; Gal. 2:16 and note 1.</li>
	<li>Faith comes out of hearing, hearing is through the word of Christ, hearing equals seeing, and seeing equals knowing Christ&mdash;Rom. 10:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When the word of the Bible is spoken to us and heard by us, we contact Christ as the living Word in the written Word, and He becomes the applied word as the life-giving Spirit in us&mdash;John 1:1; 5:39-40; 6:63.</li>
		<li>When we look away unto Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit imparts Himself as the believing element into us that He may believe for us; hence, He Himself is our faith&mdash;Heb. 12:2a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen; nothing is impossible to faith&mdash;11:1; 2 Cor. 4:18; Matt. 17:20b.</li>
	<li>Faith is the indicator of the believers&rsquo; life in the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity&mdash;1 Thes. 1:3, 5, 7-8; Rom. 1:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faith is God&rsquo;s word accepted by us; because this faith is living and active, it results in the work of faith, which includes all the proper actions that issue out of our living faith&mdash;1 Thes. 1:7-10.</li>
		<li>Faith is to believe that God is; to believe that God is implies that we are not; He must be the only One, the unique One in everything, and we must be nothing in everything&mdash;Heb. 11:6; Gen. 5:24; John 8:58; 2 Cor. 5:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The way to receive such a faith is to contact the source, the Lord, the processed and consummated God, by calling on Him, praying to Him, and pray-reading His word&mdash;Heb. 4:16; Rom. 10:12; 2 Tim. 2:22; Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
	<li>We must exercise our spirit of faith to believe in and to speak forth the Lord; faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 4:13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The labor of love is the key of the fruitfulness of our work of faith&mdash;1 Thes. 1:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Love is the intrinsic motivation, the inner life, and the real strength of our work of faith&mdash;Gal. 5:6; cf. Col. 1:28&mdash;2:1; 1 Cor. 15:58; Acts 20:20, 31.</li>
	<li>God is love; we love because He first loved us&mdash;1 John 4:8, 19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s love motivates us, His children, to love people without any discrimination&mdash;Matt. 5:43-48; cf. 9:12-13; 27:38; Luke 23:42-43.</li>
		<li>Love motivates us to shepherd people with the loving and forgiving heart of our Father God and the shepherding and seeking spirit of our Savior Christ&mdash;15:3-10, 17-18; John 10:11, 16; 21:15-17; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:4.</li>
		<li>Love is not jealous, is not provoked, does not take account of evil, covers all things, endures all things, never falls away, and is the greatest&mdash;1 Cor. 13:4-8, 13.</li>
		<li>The Body of Christ builds itself up in love&mdash;Eph. 4:16; 1 Cor. 8:1.</li>
		<li>We need a burning spirit of love to overcome the degradation of today&rsquo;s church&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6-7; 2 Cor. 5:14; 12:15.</li>
		<li>To overcome the degradation of the church, we need to pursue love with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22; 1 Cor. 13:1.</li>
		<li>Love is the most excellent way for us to be anything and to do anything for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;12:31b&mdash;13:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The endurance of hope is the long life of our work of faith:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The life that we have received through regeneration enables us to have a hope, with numerous aspects, for this age, for the coming age, and for eternity&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; Titus 1:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In this age we have the hope of growing in life, of maturing, of manifesting our gifts, of exercising our functions, of being transformed, of overcoming, of being redeemed in our body, and of entering into glory&mdash;Col. 1:27; 1 Pet. 1:3-5, 9; Rom. 8:23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21; 2 Tim. 4:7-8.</li>
		<li>In the coming age we have the hope of entering into the kingdom, of reigning with the Lord, and of enjoying the blessings of eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;Rev. 5:10; 2 Tim. 4:18.</li>
		<li>In eternity we have the hope of being the New Jerusalem, when we will participate fully in the consummated blessings of the eternal life in its ultimate manifestation in eternity&mdash;Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The endurance of hope subdues all kinds of disappointments, discouragements, and impossibilities; it overcomes all kinds of oppositions, obstacles, and frustrations&mdash;Heb. 4:16; Phil. 2:13; 4:11-13; 1 Cor. 15:58; 2 Thes. 3:5.</li>
	<li>Such endurance consummates in gaining sinners, feeding the believers, perfecting the saints, and building up the church, the Body of Christ, for the kingdom of God and of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 6:4; 1 Cor. 15:58.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Our work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope are &ldquo;according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 10:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In spiritual work, the most important thing is to know &ldquo;the pattern...in the mountain&rdquo; (Heb. 8:5); if there is no comprehension of God&rsquo;s plan, there is no possibility for God&rsquo;s work (Acts 26:19).</li>
	<li>Every worker has a specific work which God measures to him and a pathway upon which God wants him to walk; if you are standing in your rightful position, working in your rightful service, and walking on your rightful pathway, that is the highest glory&mdash;13:25a, 36a; 20:24; 2 Tim. 4:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><h1 class="msg">Message Four</h1>
<h1 class="title">The Pattern of the Apostle Paul</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 2:1-12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The apostles were a pattern of the glad tidings that they spread&mdash;&ldquo;you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake&rdquo;&mdash;1 Thes. 1:5b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the church the most important thing is the person; the person is the way and the person is the Lord&rsquo;s work; what you are is what you do&mdash;John 5:19; 6:57; Phil. 1:19-26; Acts 20:18-35; Matt. 7:17-18; 12:33-37.</li>
	<li>We need to follow the pattern of the apostles to pay more attention to life than to work&mdash;John 12:24; 2 Cor. 4:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul was a pattern to the believers of living and ministering Christ as the Spirit in his spirit for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 1:16; 4:12; Rom. 8:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord appeared to Paul to appoint him as a minister and a witness both of the things in which Paul had seen Him and of the things in which He would appear to Paul&mdash;Acts 26:16-19; cf. 1:8; 23:11; 20:20, 31.</li>
	<li>Paul took Christ as everything&mdash;as his living, pattern, goal, and secret&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; 2:5-16; 3:7-14; 4:11-13.</li>
	<li>Paul lived by the Spirit, walked by the Spirit, sowed unto the Spirit, and ministered the Spirit as a spiritual man who lived and served in his spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 25; 6:8; 2 Cor. 3:6; 1 Cor. 2:15; 2 Cor. 2:13; Rom. 1:9; 8:16.</li>
	<li>Paul was infused with God to shine forth God in the ministry of the new covenant, which is the ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of righteousness, and the ministry of reconciliation&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; 4:1; 3:6, 8-9; 5:18-20.</li>
	<li>Paul lived and did everything in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Eph. 4:1-6, 15-16; Col. 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The best way to shepherd people, to cherish and nourish them, is to give them a proper pattern; Paul fed his spiritual children with his own living of Christ&mdash;1 Thes. 2:1-12; 2 Cor. 1:23&mdash;2:14; 11:28-29; 1 Cor. 9:22; Acts 20:28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The apostles not only preached the gospel but also lived it; their ministering of the gospel was not only by word but also by a life that displayed the power of God, a life in the Holy Spirit and in the assurance of faith&mdash;1 Thes. 1:5.</li>
	<li>The saints in Thessalonica became imitators of the apostles; this led them to follow the Lord, to take Him as their pattern, thus making them a pattern to all other believers&mdash;vv. 6-7.</li>
	<li>The apostle Paul stressed repeatedly the apostles&rsquo; entrance toward the believers; this shows that their manner of life played a great role in infusing the gospel into the new converts&mdash;vv. 5, 9; 2:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The apostles were struggling and speaking the gospel to the Thessalonians in the boldness of God&mdash;v. 2.</li>
		<li>The apostles were free from deception, uncleanness, and guile&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>The apostles were first tested and approved by God and then were entrusted by Him with the gospel; hence, their speaking, the preaching of the gospel, was not of themselves to please men but of God to please Him; God proved, examined, and tested their hearts continually&mdash;v. 4; Psa. 26:2; 139:23-24; 2 Cor. 1:12; 6:6; 7:3.</li>
		<li>The apostles were never found with flattering speech nor with a pretext for covetousness&mdash;1 Thes. 2:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To have any pretext for covetousness is to peddle or adulterate the word of God&mdash;2 Cor. 2:17; 4:2.</li>
			<li>It is also to pretend to be godly for the sake of gain&mdash;1 Tim. 6:5; Titus 1:11; 2 Pet. 2:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostles did not seek glory from men&mdash;1 Thes. 2:6a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To seek glory from men is a real temptation to every Christian worker; many have been devoured and spoiled by this matter&mdash;cf. 1 Sam. 15:12.</li>
			<li>Lucifer became God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan, because of glory-seeking; anyone who seeks glory from men is a follower of Satan&mdash;Ezek. 28:13-17; Isa. 14:12-15; Matt. 4:8-10.</li>
			<li>How much we will be used by the Lord and how long our usefulness will last depends on whether we seek glory from men&mdash;cf. John 7:17-18; 5:39-44; 12:43; 2 Cor. 4:5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostles did not stand on their own authority or dignity as apostles of Christ&mdash;1 Thes. 2:6b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To assert authority, dignity, or right in Christian work damages that work; the Lord Jesus, while on earth, gave up His dignity (John 13:4-5), and the apostle preferred not to use his right (1 Cor. 9:12).</li>
			<li>If we follow this pattern, we will kill a deadly disease in the Body of Christ, the germ of assuming a position&mdash;Matt. 20:20-28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostles cherished the believers and yearned over them as a nursing mother would cherish and yearn over her own children&mdash;1 Thes. 2:7-8; cf. Gal. 4:19; Isa. 49:14-15; 66:12-13:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To cherish people is to make them happy, to comfort them, to make them feel that you are pleasant to them, easy to be contacted in everything and in every way.</li>
			<li>To cherish people in our natural humanity is not genuine; we must cherish people with the Lord&rsquo;s presence as the charming factor, as the reality of resurrection.</li>
			<li>Cherishing includes nourishing; to nourish people is to feed them with the all-inclusive Christ in His full ministry of three stages&mdash;Eph. 5:29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostles not only imparted the gospel of God to the Thessalonians; they also imparted their own souls&mdash;1 Thes. 2:8:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To live a clean and upright life (vv. 3-6, 10) and to love the new converts, even by giving our own souls to them (vv. 7-9, 11), are the prerequisites for infusing them with the gospel.</li>
			<li>Paul was willing to spend not only what he had but also himself, his very being, on behalf of the saints&mdash;2 Cor. 12:15.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostles considered themselves as fathers in exhorting the believers to walk in a manner worthy of God, to have a walk that will enable them to enter into the kingdom of God and usher them into the glory of God&mdash;1 Thes. 2:11-12.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>As believers in Christ and children of God, we should walk in a manner worthy of God&mdash;1 Thes. 2:12:

	<li>First Thessalonians 2:12 is an explanation of 1:1; in order for the church to be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ in a practical way, the believers must walk in a manner worthy of God&mdash;Eph. 4:1, 17; 5:1-2, 8; 2 Cor. 5:7; 1 John 1:7; 2:6.</li>

			<li>Only God is worthy of Himself, and only God can be compared with Himself and match Himself&mdash;1 Pet. 1:15-16.</li>
			<li>Since only God is worthy of Himself, to walk in a manner worthy of God is to live God, that is, to express God in our daily living&mdash;1 Cor. 10:31:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) As children of God with the life and nature of God, we can walk in a manner worthy of God by living God&mdash;John 1:12-13; 1 John 3:1.</li>
				<li>2) To live God&rsquo;s life means to live by God and even to live God Himself.</li>
				<li>3) Only a life that lives God is worthy of God; when we live God, we walk in a manner worthy of Him&mdash;Phil. 1:20-21a; 1 Thes. 2:12.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy is a matter of having God as life and living Him; according to His economy, God&rsquo;s intention is to impart His element, His substance, and the ingredients of His nature into our being that we may live Him&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 3:16-19; Phil. 1:20-21a.</li>
		<li>To know God is to live God, and to live God is to know God&mdash;Heb. 8:10-11.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s aim in His economy is that we, His chosen and redeemed people, have His life and nature inwardly and His image and likeness outwardly&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the divine life and by the law of the divine life, God will be wrought into us, and we will live Him and be constituted with Him in His life and nature but not in His Godhead&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11, 29.</li>
			<li>Eventually, we will be a corporate entity&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;to be one with Him and live Him for His corporate expression&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention was to make Job a man of God, filled with Christ, the embodiment of God, to be the fullness of God for the expression of God in Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 6:11; 2 Tim. 3:17; Eph. 3:16-19:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with His holy people is that He desires that they would be emptied of everything and receive only God as their gain&mdash;Job 2:4-6.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to tear us down and rebuild us with Himself as our life and nature so that we may be persons who are absolutely one with Him.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s stripping and consuming were exercised over Job to tear him down so that God might have a base and a way to rebuild him with God Himself, thereby making him a God-man&mdash;42:1-6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>To walk in a manner worthy of God by living God is to live the life of a God-man:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We need to see that we are God-men, born of God and belonging to the species of God&mdash;John 3:3, 5-6.</li>
			<li>A God-man lives God and expresses God; the living of a God-man is the living of God in man&mdash;Phil. 1:20-21a.</li>
			<li>God-men are divine and mystical persons, doing everything with God, in God, by God, and through God&mdash;1 Cor. 10:31; Col. 3:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To walk in a manner worthy of God is to walk according to the mingled spirit; this is to live, move, have our being, and do everything according to the Spirit in our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16, 25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The spirit in Romans 8:4 is not merely the Spirit of God, nor is it simply the spirit of man; rather, it is the mingled spirit, the mingling of God&rsquo;s Spirit with man&rsquo;s spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>To walk according to the mingled spirit is not only to walk according to the Spirit of God but also to walk by following our regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by the Spirit of God&rsquo;s life&mdash;John 3:6; Rom. 8:2, 10-11.</li>
	<li>Obeying the sense of life, obeying the teaching of the anointing, and walking according to the spirit are three aspects of one thing&mdash;v. 6; 1 John 2:27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Obedience to the sense of life is related to Christ as life and is a matter of life&mdash;Rom. 8:6; Col. 3:4.</li>
		<li>Obedience to the teaching of the anointing is related to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s moving as the ointment and is a matter of the Spirit of life&mdash;Rom. 8:2.</li>
		<li>Walking according to the spirit concerns our walk according to the mingled spirit and is a matter not only of the Spirit of life but also of our regenerated spirit&mdash;v. 4; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Walking according to the mingled spirit causes our flesh, self, and natural life to lose their position and function&mdash;Gal. 5:16; Matt. 16:24; 1 Cor. 2:11-15.</li>
	<li>Walking according to the mingled spirit allows the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;the Spirit&mdash;to gain the full ground in us so that we may be one with Him for His corporate expression&mdash;Eph. 3:16-21.</li>
	<li>Every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the first kind of walk <em>(peripateo)</em> we take the Spirit as the essence of our life in our daily living&mdash;v. 16.</li>
		<li>In the second kind of walk <em>(stoicheo)</em> we take the Spirit as the path for our way so that we may fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and reach the goal of our life on earth&mdash;v. 25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By walking according to the mingled spirit, we keep ourselves under the &ldquo;shower&rdquo; of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 11.</li>
	<li>Ultimately, the Bible requires only one thing of us&mdash;that we walk according to the mingled spirit&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	<li>To walk according to the mingled spirit is to let the processed Triune God fill and saturate us until He permeates our whole being to be expressed through us in a corporate way as the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 3:16-21; 4:4-6, 16; Col. 1:27; 2:19; 3:4, 10-11; Rev. 21:2, 10-11.</li>

	<li>The kingdom of God is the sphere for us to worship God and enjoy God under the divine ruling with a view of entering into God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;Matt. 6:13b.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s work with the new believers nourished them, cherished them, and fostered them to walk in a manner worthy of God so that they might be able to enter into His kingdom and participate in His glory&mdash;1 Thes. 2:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The New Testament is a book of the kingdom of God; the entire New Testament is on the kingdom&mdash;Matt. 3:2; 4:17; Rev. 11:15; 12:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The kingdom of God is a divine sphere for God to work out His plan; it is a realm where God can exercise His authority to accomplish what He intends&mdash;Matt. 6:10.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is not only God&rsquo;s reign over the universe in a general way by His authority and power but also God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life&mdash;John 3:5, 15; Rom. 14:17; 8:2, 6, 10-11.</li>
	<li>As God incarnate, the Lord Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God, to establish a realm in which God can carry out His purpose through the exercise of His authority&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 3:3, 5; 18:36.</li>
	<li>The New Testament preaches the gospel in the way of the kingdom; the gospel is for the kingdom, and the gospel is proclaimed so that rebellious sinners might be saved, qualified, and equipped to enter into the kingdom&mdash;Mark 1:14-15; Matt. 4:17; Acts 8:12.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament, the kingdom of God goes with His salvation, and God&rsquo;s salvation goes with the kingdom&mdash;Eph. 2:8, 19; Rev. 12:10.</li>
	<li>Repentance is mainly for us to enter into the kingdom of God; unless we repent&mdash;that is, have a change of concept&mdash;we cannot enter into the kingdom&mdash;Mark 1:15; Matt. 3:2; 4:17.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is God Himself, and God is life, having the nature, ability, and shape of the divine life, which forms the realm of God&rsquo;s ruling&mdash;Mark 1:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The drawing near of the kingdom of God is the drawing near of God Himself.</li>
		<li>The nature of the kingdom of God is divine because it is the kingdom of <em>God</em> with the divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness&mdash;1 John 4:8, 16; 1:5; 2:29; 1 Pet. 1:15-16.</li>
		<li>Only by having the divine life can we enter into the divine realm.</li>
		<li>The only way to enter into the kingdom of God is to receive God as life and to gain God Himself&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 3:15; 1 John 5:11-12.</li>
		<li>Because through regeneration we receive the divine life, the life of God, regeneration is the unique entrance into the kingdom&mdash;John 3:3, 5, 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through regeneration we have been transferred into the delightful kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love&mdash;a realm where we are ruled in love with life&mdash;Col. 1:13.</li>

	<li>The eternal kingdom of God is the increase of Christ in administration&mdash;Dan. 2:34-35, 44; Mark 4:26-29.</li>
	<li>Today the believers live the kingdom life in the church, for the church is the kingdom of God in this age&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19; 1 Cor. 6:10; Eph. 5:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church life is the kingdom in a developmental stage, a preliminary stage&mdash;Rev. 1:9.</li>
		<li>When the authority of God&rsquo;s kingdom is allowed to operate in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>The work of the church is to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 13:43; 6:10; 12:22-28; Rev. 11:15; 12:10.</li>

	<li>The New Testament emphasizes the cross, the church, and the kingdom; the cross produces the church, and the church ushers in the kingdom&mdash;16:18-19, 24.</li>
	<li>To enter into the kingdom of God, we need to pass through sufferings; to be &ldquo;accounted worthy of the kingdom of God,&rdquo; we need our faith to grow, our love to increase, and our endurance to be maintained&mdash;Acts 14:22; 2 Thes. 1:5.</li>
	<li>After we have entered into the kingdom of God through regeneration, we need to go on to have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ by experiencing the full development of the divine life as revealed in 2 Peter 1:5-11.</li>
	<li>As a result of the growth and development of the divine life to maturity and of living in the reality of the kingdom in the church life today, we will inherit the kingdom of God&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 15:50; Gal. 5:21.</li>

	<li>First Thessalonians 2:12 indicates that we enter into the kingdom of God and into the glory of God simultaneously.</li>

		<li>The full salvation of God is in three stages: the initial stage&mdash;the stage of regeneration; the progressing stage&mdash;the stage of transformation; and the completing stage&mdash;the stage of glorification&mdash;1 Cor. 6:11; Rom. 5:10; Phil. 3:21.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s salvation includes the salvation from many things in our daily life, the salvation from suffering during the great tribulation, and the salvation of our soul, which will save us from dispensational punishment&mdash;1:19, 28; 2:12; Luke 21:36; 1 Thes. 5:9; Rev. 3:10; 1 Pet. 1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s salvation is in sanctification of the Spirit&mdash;2 Thes. 2:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Salvation in sanctification means that if we would enjoy and participate in God&rsquo;s complete salvation, we must be in the sanctification of the Spirit.</li>
		<li>The Spirit dwells in us with a unique goal&mdash;to sanctify us, to separate us entirely for God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;1 Thes. 1:6; 4:8:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Holy Spirit is moving, working, and acting within us constantly to sanctify us&mdash;Heb. 12:14.</li>
			<li>The Spirit is always sanctifying us, applying to us what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished&mdash;Eph. 1:3-14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God has placed us into the process of sanctification, which is a matter of transformation&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18:

		<li>God makes us holy by imparting Himself, the Holy One, into us so that our whole being may be saturated and permeated with His holy nature&mdash;1 Pet. 1:15-16.</li>
		<li>As the Spirit carries out His sanctifying work, He imparts God&rsquo;s life into us; the extent to which the impartation of life will proceed depends on the degree to which the Spirit is able to sanctify us&mdash;Rom. 6:22; 8:2, 11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Salvation in sanctification is not only of the Spirit but also in belief of the truth, that is, in the word as the truth&mdash;2 Thes. 2:13; Col. 1:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be sanctified in belief, or faith, of the truth in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 17:17, where He asked the Father to sanctify us in the truth and declared that the Father&rsquo;s word is truth.</li>
		<li>In order to receive the sanctification of the Spirit, we must go to the Word.</li>
		<li>The more we see the truth, the reality, revealed in the New Testament, the more we enjoy sanctification&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:15, 25.</li>
		<li>To be sanctified in belief of the truth is subjective; God&rsquo;s salvation in sanctification is carried out not merely in our objective knowledge of the truth but in our subjective apprehension of the truth&mdash;John 17:17, 19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God has called us to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth through the gospel &ldquo;unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;&mdash;2 Thes. 2:14:

	<li>Salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth is the procedure; the obtaining of the glory of our Lord is the goal&mdash;Heb. 2:10.</li>
	<li>The glory that the Father has given to the Son is the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and divine nature to express the Father in His fullness&mdash;John 17:22; 5:26; 1:18; 14:9; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3:

		<li>This glory the Son has given to His believers that they also may have the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and divine nature to express the Father in the Son in the Son&rsquo;s fullness&mdash;John 1:16; 17:2; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		<li>God has called us unto the obtaining of this glory, the glory of the divine life and the divine nature to express the Divine Being&mdash;1 Pet. 5:10.</li>

	<li>Second Thessalonians 1:10 speaks of Christ&rsquo;s coming &ldquo;to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed&rdquo;:

		<li>At His coming back, on the one hand, He will come from the heavens with glory, and on the other hand, He will come from within His saints so that He may be glorified in His saints&mdash;Rev. 10:1; Matt. 25:31; 2 Thes. 1:10; Col. 1:27.</li>
		<li>For Christ to be glorified in His saints means that His glory will be manifested from within His members and that it will &ldquo;transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory&rdquo;&mdash;Phil. 3:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Second Thessalonians 1:12 says, &ldquo;So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord Himself within us as our life and life supply that we may live a life that will glorify the Lord and cause us to be glorified in Him&mdash;1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>

	<li>Our heart with its condition before God is organically, intrinsically, and inseparably related to the condition of our spirit, soul, and body before God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The exercise of the spirit works only when our heart is active; if man&rsquo;s heart is indifferent, the spirit is imprisoned within and is unable to show forth its capability&mdash;Matt. 5:3, 8; Psa. 78:8; Eph. 3:16-17.</li>
		<li>The soul is the person himself, but the heart is the person in action; the heart is the acting agent, the acting commissioner, of our entire being.</li>
		<li>The activities and movements of our physical body depend on our physical heart; in like manner, our daily living, the way we act and behave, depends on what kind of psychological heart we have.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The heart is the entrance and exit of life, the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; of life; if the heart is not right, life in the spirit is hindered, and the law of life cannot work freely and without obstruction to reach every part of our being; though life has great power, this great power is controlled by our small heart&mdash;Prov. 4:23; Matt. 12:33-37; cf. Ezek. 36:26-27.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to live a holy life for the church life, we need the Lord to establish our heart blameless in holiness&mdash;1 Thes. 3:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is the unchanging One, but according to our natural birth our heart is changeable, both in our relationship with others and with the Lord&mdash;cf. 2 Tim. 4:10; Matt. 13:3-9, 18-23.</li>
	<li>There is no one who, according to his natural, human life, is steadfast in his heart; because our heart changes so easily, it is not at all trustworthy&mdash;Jer. 17:9-10; 13:23.</li>
	<li>Our heart is blamable because it is changeable; an unchanging heart is a blameless heart&mdash;Psa. 57:7; 108:1; 112:7.</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s salvation the renewing of the heart is once for all; however, in our experience our heart is renewed continually, because it is changeable&mdash;Ezek. 36:26; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
	<li>Because our heart is changeable, it needs to be renewed continually by the sanctifying Spirit so that our heart can be established, built up, in the state of being holy, the state of being separated unto God, occupied by God, possessed by God, and saturated with God&mdash;Titus 3:5; Rom. 6:19, 22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to be &ldquo;those who are being sanctified&rdquo; in living a holy life for the church life, we must cooperate with the inner operating of the One &ldquo;who sanctifies&rdquo; by dealing with our heart&mdash;Heb. 2:11; Psa. 139:23-24; <em>Hymns,</em> #744:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God wants our heart to be soft:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When God deals with our heart, He takes away the heart of stone out of our flesh and gives us a heart of flesh, a soft heart&mdash;Ezek. 36:26.</li>
		<li>To be soft means that our heart is submissive and yielding toward the Lord, not stiff-necked and rebellious&mdash;cf. Exo. 32:9.</li>
		<li>A soft heart is a heart that is not hardened by worldly traffic&mdash;Matt. 13:4.</li>
		<li>God softens our heart by using His love to move us; if love cannot move us, He uses His hand through the environment to discipline us until our heart is softened&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14; 4:16-18; Heb. 12:6-7; cf. Jer. 48:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God wants our heart to be pure:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A pure heart is a heart that loves God and wants God; besides God, it has no other love, inclination, or desire&mdash;Psa. 73:25; cf. Jer. 32:39.</li>
		<li>Our heart should be single for God so that we are fearful of nothing except offending Him and losing His presence&mdash;Psa. 86:11b.</li>
		<li>Our goal and our aim should be God Himself, and we should not have any other motive&mdash;Matt. 5:8.</li>
		<li>We must pursue Christ &ldquo;with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&rdquo;&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22; 1 Tim. 1:5; Psa. 73:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God wants our heart to be loving:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A loving heart is a heart in which the emotion loves God, wants God, thirsts after God, and yearns for God, having a personal, affectionate, private, and spiritual relationship with Him&mdash;42:1-2; S. S. 1:1-4.</li>
		<li>We must turn our heart back to the Lord again and again and have it continually renewed so that we may have a new and fresh love toward the Lord&mdash;2 Cor. 3:16; <em>Hymns,</em> #546 and #547.</li>
		<li>All spiritual experiences start with love in the heart; if we do not love the Lord, it is impossible to receive any kind of spiritual experience&mdash;cf. Eph. 6:24.</li>
		<li>Our love for the Lord qualifies, perfects, and equips us to speak for the Lord with His authority; if we love the Lord to the uttermost, we will be filled and overflowing with Him&mdash;John 21:15-17; Matt. 26:6-13; 28:18-20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God wants our heart to be at peace:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A heart at peace is a heart in which the conscience is without offense, condemnation, or reproach&mdash;Acts 24:16; 1 John 3:19-21; Heb. 10:22.</li>
		<li>If we confess our sins in the light of God&rsquo;s presence, we receive His forgiveness and His cleansing so that we may enjoy uninterrupted fellowship with God with a good conscience&mdash;1 John 1:7, 9; 1 Tim. 1:5.</li>
		<li>The result of practicing fellowship with God in prayer is that we enjoy the peace of God, which is actually God as peace mounting guard over our heart and thoughts in Christ, keeping us calm and tranquil&mdash;Phil. 4:6-7.</li>
		<li>We need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our heart by forgiving one another to put on the one new man&mdash;Col. 3:13-15.</li>
		</ol></li>

<li>As our heart is being established blameless in holiness by the continual renewing of the sanctifying Spirit, we are becoming the New Jerusalem with the newness of the divine life and we are becoming the holy city with the holiness of the divine nature&mdash;Rev. 21:2; 1 John 5:11-12; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 5:12-24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God not only has made us holy in position by the redeeming blood of Christ to separate us unto Himself in His judicial redemption but also is sanctifying us in disposition by His own holy nature to saturate us with Himself in His organic salvation&mdash;Heb. 13:12; 10:29; Rom. 6:19, 22; Eph. 5:26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s dispositional sanctification of our spirit, soul, and body is to &ldquo;sonize&rdquo; us divinely, making us sons of God that we may become the same as God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead so that we can be God&rsquo;s expression&mdash;1:4-5; Heb. 2:10-11.</li>
	<li>By sanctifying us, God transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature; in this way He preserves our spirit, soul, and body wholly complete&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God not only sanctifies us wholly but also preserves our spirit, soul, and body complete:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Quantitatively, God sanctifies us wholly; qualitatively, God preserves us complete; that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect.</li>
	<li>Although God preserves us, we need to take the responsibility, the initiative, to cooperate with His operation to be preserved by keeping our spirit, soul, and body in the saturating of the Holy Spirit&mdash;vv. 12-24.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to cooperate with God to preserve our spirit in sanctification, we must keep our spirit in a living condition by exercising our spirit:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to preserve our spirit, we must keep our spirit living by exercising it to have fellowship with God; if we fail to exercise our spirit in this way, we will leave it in a deadened situation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To rejoice, pray, and give thanks are to exercise our spirit; to preserve our spirit is first of all to exercise our spirit to keep our spirit living and to pull it out of death&mdash;vv. 16-18.</li>
		<li>We need to cooperate with the sanctifying God to be separated from a spirit-deadening situation&mdash;cf. Num. 6:6-8; 2 Cor. 5:4.</li>
		<li>We must worship God, serve God, and fellowship with God in and with our spirit; whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do toward God must be in our spirit&mdash;John 4:24; Rom. 1:9; Phil. 2:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to preserve our spirit, we need to keep it from all defilement and contamination&mdash;2 Cor. 7:1.</li>
	<li>In order to preserve our spirit, we must exercise ourselves to have a conscience without offense toward God and men&mdash;Acts 24:16; Rom. 9:1; cf. 8:16.</li>
	<li>In order to preserve our spirit, we must take heed to our spirit, setting our mind on our spirit and caring for the rest in our spirit&mdash;Mal. 2:15-16; Rom. 8:6; 2 Cor. 2:13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to cooperate with God to preserve our soul in sanctification, we must clear the three main &ldquo;arteries&rdquo; of our psychological heart, the parts of our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order for our soul to be sanctified, our mind must be renewed to be the mind of Christ (Rom. 12:2), our emotion must be touched and saturated with the love of Christ (Eph. 3:17, 19), our will must be subdued by and infused with the resurrected Christ (Phil. 2:13; cf. S. S. 4:4a; 7:4a), and we must love the Lord with our whole being (Mark 12:30).</li>
	<li>The way to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart is to make a thorough confession to the Lord; we need to stay with the Lord for a period of time, asking Him to bring us fully into the light, and in the light of what He exposes, we need to confess our defects, failures, defeats, mistakes, wrongdoings, and sins&mdash;1 John 1:5-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In order to unclog the artery of our mind, we need to confess everything that is sinful in our thoughts and in our way of thinking.</li>
		<li>In order to unclog the artery of our will, we need to confess the germs of rebellion in our will.</li>
		<li>In order to unclog the artery of our emotion, we need to confess the natural and even fleshy way that we express our joy and sorrow and also that, in many cases, we hate what we should love and we love what we should hate.</li>
		<li>If we take the time necessary to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart, we will have the sense that our entire being has become living and is in a very healthy condition.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to cooperate with God to preserve our body in sanctification, we must present our body to Him so that we may live a holy life for the church life, practicing the Body life in order to carry out God&rsquo;s perfect will&mdash;Rom. 12:1-2; 1 Thes. 4:4; 5:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Our fallen body, the flesh, is the &ldquo;meeting hall&rdquo; of Satan, sin, and death, but by Christ&rsquo;s redemption and in our regenerated spirit as the &ldquo;meeting hall&rdquo; of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, our body is a member of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit&mdash;Rom. 6:6, 12, 14; 7:11, 24; 1 Cor. 6:15, 19.</li>
	<li>To preserve our body is to glorify God in our body&mdash;v. 20.</li>
	<li>To preserve our body is to magnify Christ in our body&mdash;Phil. 1:20.</li>
	<li>To preserve our body, we must not live according to our soul, the old man; then the body of sin will lose its job and become unemployed&mdash;Rom. 6:6.</li>
	<li>To preserve our body, we must not present our body to anything that is sinful but instead present ourselves as slaves to righteousness and our members as weapons of righteousness&mdash;vv. 13, 18-19, 22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from fornication; that each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor&rdquo;&mdash;1 Thes. 4:3-4.</li>
		<li>That they do not know God is the basic reason that people indulge in the passion of lust&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To preserve our body, we must buffet it and lead it as a slave to fulfill our holy purpose to become the holy city&mdash;1 Cor. 9:27; Rev. 21:2.</li>

Dan. 2:28; 9:24-27</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The two Epistles to the Thessalonians were written in the light of the Lord&rsquo;s coming; the Lord&rsquo;s coming (Gk. <em>parousia</em>) is His presence:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Every chapter of 1 Thessalonians ends with the coming of the Lord; this shows that the writer, Paul, lived and worked with the Lord&rsquo;s coming before him, taking it as an attraction, an incentive, a goal, and a warning&mdash;1:10; 2:19; 3:13; 4:15-18; 5:23.</li>
	<li>Because we are awaiting the Son of God from the heavens, our future is focused on Him; our life declares that we have no hope on this earth and no positive destiny in this age, and that our hope is the coming Lord, who is our destiny forever; this governs, holds, and keeps our Christian life for the church life&mdash;1:10; 2 Thes. 2:1, 8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see &ldquo;the coming [presence&mdash;Gk. <em>parousia</em> ] of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 1-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Before the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the overcomers among the believers will be raptured into Christ&rsquo;s presence (parousia) in the heavens&mdash;Rev. 12:5-6; 14:1-5; Luke 21:34-36; Matt. 24:36-44.</li>
	<li>At the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week in Daniel 9:27, the majority of the believers, both the dead and resurrected and the living, will be raptured into Christ&rsquo;s presence (parousia) in the air; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 speaks of this rapture, which corresponds to the reaping of the harvest in Revelation 14:14-16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The prophecy of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24-27 shows that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming is very near; the seventy weeks are divided into three parts, each week being seven years in length&mdash;cf. 2 Pet. 1:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First, seven weeks (forty-nine years) were apportioned from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (Neh. 2:1-8) to the completion of the rebuilding.</li>
	<li>Second, sixty-two weeks (434 years) were apportioned from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off (crucifixion) of the Messiah&mdash;Dan. 9:26.</li>
	<li>Third, the last week of seven years will be for Antichrist to make a firm covenant with the people of Israel (v. 27); in the middle of that week he will break the covenant, terminate Israel&rsquo;s sacrifices and oblations to God, and persecute those who fear God (v. 27; Rev. 13); this will be the beginning of the great tribulation, which will last for three and a half years:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When there is news that such a strong man signs a treaty of seven years with Israel, we have to prepare ourselves to be raptured&mdash;Matt. 24:32-44.</li>
		<li>At the beginning of the great tribulation, Antichrist&rsquo;s image will be set up in the temple as an idol, and he will sit in the temple of God, exalting himself above every object of worship; this means that the temple must be rebuilt before the great tribulation begins&mdash;vv. 15, 21; Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:3-4; Dan. 11:36-37.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>There is a gap of unknown duration between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week of the seventy weeks; this gap is the age of mystery, the age of grace, the age of the church&mdash;Eph. 3:3-11; 5:32; Col. 1:27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>During this age Christ is secretly and mysteriously building up the church in the new creation to be His Body and His bride&mdash;Eph. 5:25-32.</li>
		<li>At the end of the last week of the seventy weeks, Christ with His overcomers, His bridal army, will come as the smiting stone to crush the totality of human government and become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, that fills the whole earth&mdash;Dan. 2:34-35; 2 Thes. 2:8; Rev. 19:19-20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must be those who have dispensational value to God &ldquo;in the last days,&rdquo; those who are being prepared to be God&rsquo;s dispensational instrument, Christ&rsquo;s bridal army, to turn the age for the glory of God and the kingdom of God&mdash;Dan. 2:28; Rev. 12:1-5; 14:1-5; 19:7-9, 13-16.</li>
<li>The Lord will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him and will steal them away as His treasures to bring them into His presence in the heavens; hence, we must watch and make ourselves ready to be His bride&mdash;Dan. 10:19; Matt. 24:42-44; 25:13; Rev. 19:7; 22:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Every day that we have is truly the Lord&rsquo;s grace; therefore, as long as we have today, as long as we still have breath, we must love the Lord and His appearing, await the Lord&rsquo;s coming, and always take His coming as an encouragement&mdash;1 Thes. 5:1-11; 2 Tim. 4:1, 6-8; Luke 12:16-20.</li>
	<li>We must be absolutely consecrated to God, having one heart to love Him, seek Him, live Him, and be constituted with Him to be His expression&mdash;Jer. 32:39.</li>
	<li>We must be reconstituted with the holy Word of God, reading the Bible all the days of our life&mdash;Col. 3:16; Deut. 17:18-20; Psa. 119:15-16; 2 Tim. 3:16-17.</li>
	<li>We must persevere in prayer to glorify God, thank God, worship God, and serve God; our prayer and our being should be totally for God&rsquo;s interests&mdash;Dan. 6:10; 9:17; 1 Kings 8:48; cf. Rom. 1:21, 25.</li>
	<li>We must be self-sacrificing persons in oneness with Christ as the One who sacrifices Himself for others&mdash;1 Thes. 2:1-12, 19-20; 5:12-15; Phil. 1:22-26.</li>
	<li>We must be watchful, on the alert, for our prayer life, cooperating with the indwelling, sanctifying Spirit to live a rejoicing, praying, and thanking life as a glory to God and a shame to His enemy&mdash;Matt. 25:13; Col. 4:2; 1 Thes. 5:16-18.</li>
	<li>We must not beat our fellow slaves, eat and drink with the drunken, or bury the Lord&rsquo;s gift; instead, we must feed God&rsquo;s children, spreading the truth of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth&mdash;Matt. 24:14, 45-51; 25:25.</li>
	<li>We must keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance, standing against the wearing-out tactics of Satan, and live, walk, and work by faith and love in the hope of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back&mdash;Rev. 3:10; Dan. 7:25; 1 Thes. 1:3.</li>

<li>In Song of Songs 6:13 the lover, having passed through various stages of transformation, has become the Shulammite, Solomon&rsquo;s duplication:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>She is the same as Solomon in life, nature, expression, and function, as Eve was to Adam&mdash;Gen. 2:20-23.</li>
	<li>This signifies that in the maturity of Christ&rsquo;s life the lover of Christ becomes the same as He is in life, nature, expression, and function but not in the Godhead&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.</li>
	<li>At this point the Shulammite becomes Solomon&rsquo;s co-worker; this indicates that eventually Christ&rsquo;s lovers need to share in the work of the Lord, working with Him for His Body&mdash;Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10; Col. 4:11.</li>

<li>Song of Songs 7:9b-13 reveals that the lover works with her Beloved for His Body:

		<li>To enter into God&rsquo;s New Testament economy requires that we grow and mature in the life of God&mdash;1 Cor. 2:6; Col. 1:28.</li>
		<li>To be transformed is to be metabolically changed in our natural life, but to be matured is to be filled with the divine life that changes us&mdash;Heb. 6:1.</li>

		<li>The work of the Triune God in us is to produce and build up the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:16-21; 4:4-6, 12, 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Our work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the work of God&rsquo;s economy, the work of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10; Col. 4:11.</li>
			<li>All the co-workers should do the same one work universally for the one unique Body; the starting point of the work is the oneness of the Body&mdash;Eph. 4:4; 1 Cor. 16:10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>According to Song of Songs 7:11, Christ&rsquo;s lover wants to carry out with her Beloved the work that is for the entire world (fields) by sojourning from one place to another (lodging in the villages); this indicates that our work must be for the Body&mdash;Eph. 4:12.</li>

<li>In the churches (vineyards) Christ&rsquo;s lover renders her love to her Beloved&mdash;S. S. 7:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>At the place of His work, she expresses her love to the Lord:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the midst of the Lord&rsquo;s work, we give Him our love&mdash;Mark 12:30.</li>
		<li>This kind of fellowship with the Lord is an issue of an absolute union with the Lord in life&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; John 14:20; 15:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In her working together with her Beloved there is a mutual love (signified by mandrakes&mdash;S. S. 7:13; Gen. 30:14-16) giving forth its fragrance between them as a couple who love each other, signifying the bridal love between the lover of Christ and Christ, and in their working places there are plenty of fragrant and choice fruits (cf. Gal. 5:22-23; Eph. 5:9), new and old, which she stores up for her Beloved in love.</li>
	<li>Here we see the relationship between the first love and the first works&mdash;Rev. 2:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first works are works that issue from and express the first love.</li>
		<li>Only those works that are motivated by the first love are the gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12.</li>
		<li>When we are filled with the first love of the Lord, everything we do issues from and expresses our love for Him&mdash;Eph. 3:19; 4:16.</li>

<h1 class="title">Hoping to Be Raptured</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 8:1-14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Through her growth and transformation in life, the lover of Christ becomes mature in life to the extent that she has become the same as Christ in every respect, except that she still has the flesh&mdash;S. S. 8:1-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When her body is transfigured (Phil. 3:21), she and the Lord will be the same (1 John 3:2), and no one will despise her because of her shortage in the flesh&mdash;v. 1.</li>
	<li>She is hoping to be saved from her groaning for the flesh, indicating that she hopes to be raptured through the redemption of her body&mdash;vv. 2-4; Rom. 8:23; 2 Cor. 5:1-8; Eph. 4:30b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, / Leaning on her beloved?&rdquo;&mdash;S. S. 8:5a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The lover of Christ who came up once from the spiritual wilderness (the worldly environment) by herself (3:6) now comes up from the fleshly wilderness (the earthly realm) by leaning on her Beloved, trusting in Him helplessly:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Leaning on her beloved</em> implies her feeling that she is powerless and unable to walk apart from the Lord; she makes herself a burden for her Beloved to carry&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 12:9-10; 13:3-4.</li>
		<li><em>Leaning on her beloved</em> implies that, like Jacob, the socket of her hip has been touched, and her natural strength has been dealt with by the Lord&mdash;Gen. 32:24-25.</li>
		<li><em>Leaning on her beloved</em> implies that she seems to find herself pressed beyond measure, and this seems to last until the wilderness journey is over&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 1:8-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As she is waiting for His coming, she is going out with Him to meet Him (cf. Matt. 25:1); by leaning on our Beloved, we constantly enjoy Him as our &ldquo;going-out&rdquo; strength to leave the world behind&mdash;cf. Gen. 5:22-24; Heb. 11:5-6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm; / For love is as strong as death, / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; / Its flashes are the flashes of fire, / A flame of Jehovah&rdquo;&mdash;S. S. 8:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>She asks her Beloved to keep her by His love (heart) and His strength (arm), for His love is as strong as unshakable death and His jealousy is as cruel as unconquerable Sheol, which is like the jealous Jehovah, who is a consuming fire (Deut. 4:24) that burns up all the negative things.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;When she recalls her original condition, she cannot help but be filled with humility. She cannot help but consider her emptiness, the vanity of her experience, the undependability of her mind, and the futility of her pursuit. Her only hope is the Lord. She realizes that whether she can endure to the end does not depend on her own endurance, but on the Lord&rsquo;s preservation. No spiritual perfection can sustain a person until the Lord&rsquo;s return. Everything depends on God and His preserving power. When she realizes this, she cannot help but exclaim, &lsquo;Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm.&rsquo; The heart is the place of love, while the arm is the place of strength. &lsquo;Set me as permanently as a seal upon Your heart, and as indelibly as a seal upon Your arm. Just as the priests bore the Israelites upon their breasts and their shoulders, remember me constantly in Your heart and sustain me with Your arm. I know that I am weak and empty, and I am conscious of my powerlessness. Lord, I am a helpless person. If I try to preserve myself until Your coming, it will only bring shame to Your name and loss to myself. All my hopes are in Your love and power. I loved You before. But I know the undependability of that love. Now I look only to the love You have toward me. I held You once, and it seemed to be a powerful grip. But now I realize that even my strongest grip is just weakness. My trust is not in my holding power, but in Your holding power. I dare not speak of my love to You any longer. I dare not speak of my grasping of You any longer. From this point on, everything depends on Your strength and Your love&rsquo;&rdquo; (Watchman Nee, <em>The Song of Songs,</em> p. 119).</li>
	<li>His love cannot be quenched by trials nor drowned by persecutions nor replaced by any wealth&mdash;S. S. 8:7; Rom. 8:35-39; 1 Cor. 13:1-3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The lover of Christ asks Him who dwells in the believers as His gardens to let her hear His voice while her companions listen for His voice&mdash;S. S. 8:13; cf. 4:13&mdash;5:1; 6:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This indicates that in the work that we as the lovers of Christ do for Him as our Beloved, we need to maintain our fellowship with Him, always listening to Him&mdash;cf. Luke 10:38-42.</li>
	<li>Our lives depend on the Lord&rsquo;s words, and our work depends on the Lord&rsquo;s commands; the central point of our prayers should be our longing for the Lord&rsquo;s speaking&mdash;Rev. 2:7; 1 Sam. 3:9-10; cf. Isa. 50:4-5; Exo. 21:6.</li>
	<li>Without the Lord&rsquo;s words, we will not have any revelation, light, or knowledge; the life of the believers hinges totally upon the Lord&rsquo;s speaking&mdash;Eph. 5:26-27.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the concluding word of this poetic book, the lover of Christ prays that her Beloved would make haste to come back in the power of His resurrection (gazelle and young hart) to set up His sweet and beautiful kingdom (mountains of spices), which will fill the whole earth&mdash;S. S. 8:14; Rev. 11:15; Dan. 2:35:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Such a prayer portrays the union and communion between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as the bride in their bridal love, in the way that the prayer of John, a lover of Christ, as the concluding word of the Holy Scriptures, reveals God&rsquo;s eternal economy concerning Christ and the church in His divine love&mdash;Rev. 22:20.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; is the last prayer in the Bible (v. 20); the entire Bible concludes with the desire for the Lord&rsquo;s coming expressed as a prayer.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;When He comes, faith will be turned to facts, and praise will replace prayer. Love will consummate in a shadowless perfection, and we will serve Him in the sinless domain. What a day that will be! Lord Jesus, come quickly!&rdquo; (Watchman Nee, <em>The Song of Songs,</em> p. 126).</li>
