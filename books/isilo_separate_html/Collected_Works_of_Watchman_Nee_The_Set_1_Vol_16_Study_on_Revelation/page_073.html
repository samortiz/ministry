Revelation 20:5-6</H2><P>"The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years." </P><P>"The first resurrection" is not necessarily a once-only resurrection; nor does it refer to any resurrection in general. It includes all the "best" resurrections that happen before the millenium.</P><P>The word "this" in verse 5 includes the two things mentioned in verse 4, that is, the living and the reigning. The first resurrection is the "best" resurrection. The best resurrection means to live and to reign. Because verse 4 has two verbs-"lived and reigned," the word "this" in verse 5 must refer to living and reigning. This is called the first resurrection. This resurrection is a reward and is both a resurrection and a reigning with the Lord for one thousand years.</P><P>"The second death" does not merely mean to die; rather, it means to go to a certain place to suffer. This is in contrast with the first resurrection. The first resurrection is the enjoyment of glory. Not only do those believers who are resurrected from the dead partake of the first resurrection, but also all those who are raptured alive. This is because the time of the first resurrection is the time of the reward, the time of repayment (Luke 14:14; 20:34-36).</P><P>In Philippians 3:11 Paul did not hope to be resurrected from the dead (for surely all dead men will be resurrected), nor did he hope for the resurrection of the spirit (for the resurrection of the spirit is received in regeneration). Instead, what Paul hoped to receive was the "out-resurrection," which is the best resurrection, spoken of in Revelation 20:5, that is, reigning with the Lord.</P><P>Read Philippians 1:23-25 again. In chapter one Paul talked of living; he did not want to die. How then could he speak about hoping to be resurrected from the dead in chapter three? In Philippians 3:20-21 he clearly said that he was waiting for the Lord's return. Thus, his hope was to reign with the Lord.</P><P>In the Bible, the phrase resurrection from the dead includes being resurrected from the dead, but more profoundly, it also refers to reigning with the Lord.</P><P>There are two expressions in the Bible that are slightly different from each other:</P><P>(1) "The resurrection from the dead" indicates the resurrection before the millennium and refers to reigning with the Lord for one thousand years.</P><P>(2) "The resurrection of the dead" indicates the resurrection after the millennium.</P><P>"The rest of the dead" of course includes the unsaved sinners.</P><P>"Blessed" in the New Testament can be translated "happy." Those who are happy today are not necessarily holy, while those who are holy can hardly be happy today.</P><P>The first resurrection has three kinds of blessings:</P><P>(1) "Over these the second death has no authority." The second death is the lake of fire. Those who have no part in the first resurrection will have to pass through the sufferings of the second death. Some Christians will be disciplined and punished in the future (Matt. 18:34-35). First Thessalonians 4:5-6 says that those who wrong their brothers will be punished. Luke 12:4-5 exhorts men to fear the Lord because He has the authority to put some into hell. We can see that hell will have authority over certain kinds of Christians. In John 15:6 we can see that the branches that do not abide in the Lord (the vine) will receive punishment.</P><P>Some may say that the Bible states that once a man is saved he will never perish; so why does it say here that some Christians will still suffer being hurt of the second death (Rev. 2:11)? This is because some verses are easily misunderstood. They are listed below:</P><P>(a) "He shall by no means see death forever" (John 8:51-52). In the original text, it is, "Not forever see death"; "He shall by no means taste death forever" should be "He shall not forever taste of death."</P><P>(b) "They shall by no means perish forever" in John 10:28 is, in the original text, "They shall not forever perish."</P><P>(2) "They will be priests of God and of Christ." The meaning of being a priest is to be one who draws near to God. This kind of people will be particularly close to God, for they will have an intimate relationship with Him and with Christ. Today we are all priests; therefore, we all may draw near to God. But in the millennial kingdom, only those who have a part in the first resurrection will be priests of God and of Christ.</P><P>Aaron could be a priest only because his rod budded. The budding rod signifies resurrection. The chosen priest is manifested through resurrection (Num. 17:6-10).</P><P>All the people of Israel became priests when they left Egypt (Exo. 19:6). But later, due to their worshipping the golden calf, some failed, and God chose Aaron's tribe to be the priests.</P><P>Here the overcomers become priests because there is still the need to intercede for others at this time.</P><P>"They will be priests...of Christ" because, at this time, Christ will be worshipped as much as God Himself is worshipped.</P><P>(3) "And will reign with him for a thousand years." In the Old Testament, no king could be a priest, neither could any priest be a king. But here is a group of people who are both priests and kings. As priests, they draw near to God; as kings, they have dominion over the earth. Only those who have suffered may reign with the Lord and enjoy the glory with Him.</P><P>This verse only speaks of the fact of reigning. It does not say how the overcomers reign, because the reigning here is heavenly.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> </body></html>
