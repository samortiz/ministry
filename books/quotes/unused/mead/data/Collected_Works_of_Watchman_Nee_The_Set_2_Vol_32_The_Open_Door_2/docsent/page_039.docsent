   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Issue No. 10 was mailed from Hankow in the middle of August.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have hurriedly typeset Issue No. 11, hoping that the Lord would give us the grace to send this issue out from Hankow as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have not moved to another city, because Hankow is most centrally located.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The co-workers in Hankow are fulfilling their ministry under all kinds of dangers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If not for the grace of the Lord, we would have spent all our time in fear, and there would not have been any time for work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The political situation is changing unpredictably.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If Hankow becomes blocked, we will move back to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord willing, I hope to pass through Szechuan, Kweichow, Yunnan, Kwangsi, and then to Shanghai via Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Lan Tsi-yi's itinerary is still uncertain, and we can only move on according to the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Presently, we dare not make any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please send the news of the work and the news of the churches to either Hong Kong or Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you live close to Hankow and the surface mail can be delivered, you can send your letter directly to our P. O. Box in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Hwang Tze-hou has sent us letters from Shu County.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But wire transfers of funds are still impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have not received any letters from the brothers in Chou County.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not know where Brother Chai En-shang of Ho-Tsin in Shansi is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We hold him in remembrance!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning the relief to brothers and sisters who are in need because of the war, funds from Kiangsu and Chekiang have been under the direction of the few workers in Shanghai during the past months.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Funds from Szechuan, Hunan, and Hankow have been dispersed through fellowship between Brother Lan Tsi-yi and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently, any money that came in was immediately used up, mostly on those with dire problems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Relief work is like putting out fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank the Lord that some brothers and sisters moving into the Szechuan and Hunan areas through Hankow have found ways to take care of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some are still unsettled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Anyone who tries to walk from Hunan to Szechuan and then to Kansu and Sinkiang needs God's miracles to lead him on.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The few of us co-workers always pray for those brothers and sisters in tribulation and in need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please pray also for us so that we can truly be led by the Holy Spirit and be faithful in the things with which He has entrusted us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want to send any money, please send it to Mrs. Yuen How-tsai in Chungking, Szechuan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once Brother Lan Tsi-yi or this magazine has a fixed address, we will inform you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At such a critical juncture, this issue is trying its best to publish news concerning the work as well as news concerning the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We ask that the local churches try their best to give this magazine to the local brothers and sisters so that they can pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some places have many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition to announcing this magazine to them, please, if possible, use other means to send them a copy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some do not pay attention when things are announced, or some may have missed a meeting when an announcement was made.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once I went to a place and asked one sister, "Have you seen Issue No. X?" She said no. I asked, "Is it not true that they are at the meeting hall?" She said she did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, after the meeting someone had made an announcement, but the sister who was quite burdened for the magazine still missed it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Needless to say, those who are not as concerned will surely miss it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may think that since a person is not concerned about it, we should not give it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I think that some messages can give encouragement to those who are not concerned, and that we should do our best to distribute it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord does not forget us, who are always weak and cold; let us not forget those who are also weak and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am still in Wan County.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within this month I will probably be in Chungking, and by September I will be in Kuei-yang.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My address in Kuei-yang is omitted .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ruth Lee, in a mountain village in Wan County</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>August 14, 1938</S>
