<h2 class="head2">Needing to Turn to the Spirit<br />
and Live in the Spirit in the Age of the Spirit</h2>
<p>We must admit that the way the Lord is taking today is different from the way that He took twenty or thirty years ago. Today we are in the age of the spirit, and we must turn to our spirit and live in our spirit. When we began to take this way in Taiwan in 1961, I wrote at least eighty-five hymns, and three-quarters of them were on the Spirit and Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Keeping Up with the Lord&rsquo;s Vision</h2>
<p>Regrettably, many among us still adhere to the old ways of twenty or thirty years ago. Even though we have had a new beginning in Taiwan concerning our practice of living in spirit, hardly anyone has kept up. Even though a few dozen brothers tried to stress this matter after having some fellowship in the United States in 1970, nothing definite happened, and no one has paid attention to this matter. For example, hardly anyone sings the new hymns, because the atmosphere here is not according to the flow. Our practice of calling on the name of the Lord is also slowly disappearing, and even though it has not disappeared, we have long departed from our original practice.</p>
<p>In principle, our present condition in Taiwan is not much different from our former condition on the mainland. Although the Lord&rsquo;s vision has advanced, we have not kept up with it. Although we work hard and it seems as if we are endeavoring to go forward, we are, in fact, taking one step forward and then one step backward. As a result, we are back to where we started. In Southeast Asia and Taiwan the churches seem to be in the same condition that we were in twenty years ago.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reasons for Not Going Forward</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Being Neither for nor against the Lord&rsquo;s Way<br />
but Being Only Spectators</h2>
<p>According to my observation and study, the leading ones in Southeast Asia and Taiwan view the way that the Lord is taking today as if they were only spectators. They are not against it, but neither are they for it. A flock follows the head sheep, but if the leading ones do not go in this direction, the flock will not be able to go on. How can the leading ones expect the flock to go on when they themselves do not take this way?</p>
<h2 class="head3">Behaving as Spectators Resulting in<br />
Difficult Situations and a Loss of the Lord&rsquo;s Blessing</h2>
<p>Because some of the leading ones have an attitude of a spectator, they go back to the old ways as soon as there is a slight problem in implementing the new way. However, when they turn away, they can only go back to the arrangements of previous decades. This causes the saints to lose sight of the goal, and as soon as the goal is lost, there is inevitably some discord. Thus, it becomes difficult to lead the church as well as the work. When there is no goal and no way on our side, there is no ground for the Lord to bestow blessings on His side.</p>
<p>This resembles the situation in Judges 17:6, which says, &ldquo;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.&rdquo; Everyone doing that which was right in his own eyes means that everyone acted according to his own will. This does not sound good, but it is often the case. Without a vision and goal, one brother will rely on his own spiritual experiences, and another brother will rely on his. Thus, both will carry out different things. As a result, there will be many captains on one ship, but there will be no clear way to steer the ship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO REPENT AND TURN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing and Repenting<br />
for Not Going Forward in the Lord&rsquo;s Flow</h2>
<p>Since this is our condition today, we must turn. We must confess to the Lord that we have not moved forward absolutely with His flow in His way. We need the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness. This is more important than confessing other sins to the Lord. We need to repent and turn.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing and Repenting<br />
for Violating the Testimony of Oneness</h2>
<p>When we do not move forward in the Lord&rsquo;s flow, we have no way to go on. This forces us to stay in the things that we learned previously. As a word of warning, I must honestly say that relying on what we have learned in the past will divide the church. Although the brothers have no intention of causing division, the result will be division because some will practice what they have learned and others will practice what they have learned. When everyone follows their past practices, the result will be division.</p>
<p>Apart from considering the many believers who are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we can realize that even a five-member basketball team will be divided if they do not have the same game plan. The team will be divided even if all five are world-renowned experts in their own right. They will be divided over their expertise, their basketball training, and their accomplishments. Even though they are all highly trained and accomplished in basketball, it will be difficult for the team to win, because they are divided. This is not a matter of whether they can play basketball well as individuals but a matter of whether there is one game plan for the whole team. If we are a member of such a &ldquo;basketball team,&rdquo; we must repent for violating the principle of the team. Teammates must be one on the court. A game plan is secondary; oneness is primary. The players must be one no matter how they play. Not being one violates the principle of the team. Our situation today is that we are not one. May the Lord have mercy on us; He knows our situation. The Lord wants us to repent before it is too late.</p>
<p>The principle of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is oneness. Since we have violated the principle of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we must confess our sin before the Lord and repent for it. Today it is not possible to be one if there are different ways. Our oneness is based on the ground of the church and on being in spirit. We must be in spirit. If we are not in spirit, we have no way to be one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ASKING FOR ONENESS OUTWARDLY<br />
BUT BEING CONTROLLED AND GOVERNED BY VISION</h2>
<p>I am afraid that some will hear my speaking and think that I am charging all the localities to repeat the messages that I am giving. If people think this, they are wrong. I have no intention of asking us to just repeat these messages; rather, I hope that we will see the vision that the Lord wants us to live in spirit on the ground of oneness so that He can transform us and have a way to prepare His bride.</p>
<p>If we see this vision, we will not be distracted by other doctrines, nor will we even have a desire to talk about them. We will feel that the other doctrines are tasteless, and we will not be interested in them. We will only know the Lord of all, who is our God, who is our Redeemer and Savior, and who has become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to dwell in our spirit. He wants to be our life and everything, and He wants us to live by Him and live with Him. In this mingled spirit we are being transformed and built together. This is the vision that the Lord is showing us today. If we have seen this and if we live in this governing and controlling vision, we will not be interested in anything else.</p>
<p>We all must be in spirit; this is a basic exercise. Then we should bring the church, that is, bring the brothers and sisters, to live in the spirit. There is a rich supply of materials among us related to this burden. Hence, I am not asking us to be megaphones that broadcast whatever I speak. I want us to see a vision, to be governed and controlled by it, and to live in it. There is a rich supply of material that can help us in our speaking concerning these matters. If we digest these materials and then release the word in fellowship with a group of brothers and sisters in our localities, the churches will receive a substantial supply.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
