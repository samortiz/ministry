   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Tearing Down and His Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can find one fact in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people have been Christians for one, two, three, five, or even twenty or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The strange thing is that when they first became Christians, they were very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the more they went on as Christians, the more they could not control their temper, and the worse they became.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I remember many people telling me that at the beginning, they were very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They could forgive, they could pray, and they could suffer any treatment from others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others could treat them any way they wanted in school, at home, and at work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But now they could not tolerate the same things anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the past they could do everything; now they cannot do these things anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes they managed to hold back their temper, but something within them wanted revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen too many examples of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can tell you one thousand, even ten thousand, stories like this one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people can testify that once they were humble, but they cannot be humble anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once they were patient, but they cannot be patient anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once they were loving, but they cannot be loving anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once they were meek, but they have become stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once they were zealous, but they have become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They cannot explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers, we have to remember that God must take away everything that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we first believed in the Lord, we felt that we lacked love, and we asked God for love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To put it in simple language, God gave us a "dose" of love, or a "packet" of love, so that we could love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was a thing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may have received plenty of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But God cannot allow love to remain forever as a thing in us; He has to put Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, He removes that love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people had a bad temper before they believed in the Lord; their temper was quick.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After they picked up patience, patience became a thing, a gift, a salvation, or a spare part to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as they had such a thing, they could work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the first, second, and third year, these things may have served well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, by the fifth year, or even as early as the third year, the situation began to change; the things themselves were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today God is doing the same work in many of His children; He is removing all the things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only will He remove the worldly things; He will remove the spiritual things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before you were saved, the matters and things of the world took the place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After you were saved, spiritual matters and things took the place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day God will show you that "Christ is all the world to you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once God took away the things and matters of the world from you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now He is taking away spiritual things and matters from you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He will take away your patience, your love, your power, your meekness, your humility, and everything that you have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will show you that you do not live by patience but by a person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will be patient because you have received a person, not because you have received a power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You will be humble, not because you have received a power, but because you have received a person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the spiritual things have to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the "its" have to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, God's tearing down work, as well as His building work, goes on daily in many of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Daily "things" are torn down, and Christ is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the way God deals with His children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past, God might have given you a thing; He might have given you a power for endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You were so sure of this experience that you could almost write down the words: "My problem with endurance is over."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Next you had to deal with humility, and God gave you another thing; He gave you the strength to humble yourself, and you were able to say that the problem of humility was also settled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When another thing is not settled, you pray daily before the Lord to try to solve it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are always busy solving this and that problem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You are always trying to deal with this and that question.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are always dealing with individual problems.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers, God will take away many "things" from you; He will only give you One; He will only give you a person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This One will be your humility, your endurance, your meekness, and your love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is the One who is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you have Him, you can truly say, "God, You are the I am."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is continually tearing down and building up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He will continue this work until one day we can say that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One day the universe will confess that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But first God wants us to confess within ourselves that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Forgive me for speaking something about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I care much for many people and bear much of the responsibility for their spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When I met a brother who was wrong, I often tried to exhort him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But I could only say, "Brother, you are lacking in love.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Next time, you have to love your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He may have succeeded in loving, and I may have felt great that I saw some result to my work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But actually, what he acquired was love and not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Love to that brother was not a person but a thing, a behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a Christianity of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is human conduct; it is man who is working, seeking, hoping, praying, believing, receiving, gaining, and acquiring something called love.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why I say that love is only a thing and a behavior to him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if that love is Christ, it is a totally different story.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ alone is everything; it is not him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ is loving; it is not him who is loving.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This makes love a law of life instead of an act of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a different kind of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I do not know whether you have seen the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What do you feel when you render some help to a brother and open his eyes and help him to go on with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The most difficult thing we face today is that many people are merely involved in the things of Christianity; they do not know Christ and have not realized that God's thing is just Christ.</S>
