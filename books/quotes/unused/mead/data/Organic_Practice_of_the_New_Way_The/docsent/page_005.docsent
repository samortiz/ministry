   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Teaching Instructing and Perfecting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Small Group Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How should the small group meetings be conducted?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The key is to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The small group meeting should begin from your own home.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the time of the meeting may be scheduled at 7:30, you should begin praying at home before seven o clock.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While you are on the way to the meeting, you should continue to pray and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you arrive at the brother s house, you may find that some brothers are there already.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should then begin the meeting by praising, praying, or fellowshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The content of the meeting should be of the following items only: the first is fellowship; the second is prayer; the third is mutual care; the fourth is the teaching of the truth; the fifth is the pursuit of life; and the sixth is the mutual encouragement and teaching, and the preaching of the gospel by going out to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every time the small group comes together, whatever it does, the content should be one of these six things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some may arrive early.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They can begin praising or praying, or interceding for the ones that are sick, or giving testimonies of healing, thus caring for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps some may ask about the significance of the Lord s Table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every attendant should speak a little.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a few minutes, the truth will be made clear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If others have not covered the matter thoroughly, you can spend a few more minutes to explain a little the meaning of the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what I mean by an organic small group.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of you need to learn to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are willing to do this for six months and the new ones see this kind of example week after week, spontaneously they will also become organic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way, after half a year, of the dozen or so new ones, at least a few will be able to graduate, to leave the original small group to establish their own new small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will preach the gospel by visiting people accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And after people are saved, they will learn to nourish them in their homes and will set up organic small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way, after a saved one learns in a small group for half a year, he can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He can preach the gospel and can bring in the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He can set up new small groups, and he can prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever you can do, he can do also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An organic small group should have this kind of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, the gifts and the riches in life that are in everyone are manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result, everyone will be able to prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Building Prophesying in the District Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is to supply Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the main work in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The whole chapter of 1 Corinthians 14 talks about prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It promotes, uplifts, recommends, and encourages prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 1 says, Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the end, verse 39 says, Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once you prophesy, you excel v. 12 , and the meeting becomes rich.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 31 says, For you can all prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one is unable to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 24 says, But if all prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that all should prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, when an unbeliever comes, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>24b-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prophesying enables all to learn and all be encouraged v. 31 . Moreover, to prophesy is to speak to men for building up and encouragement and consolation, that the church may be built up vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we all need to learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order that everyone can prophesy, there is a practical and simple way, which is to have every saint revived every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every week, divide up a chapter of the Bible into six portions, and read one portion each morning, picking out two verses in it for pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then write down the inspiration and response every day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On Saturday evening, pray-read over the inspirations that are written, and compose a paragraph from them for prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Preferably, you should help the brothers and sisters to improve a little on these compositions so that the content will be concise.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You should also tell them that these compositions are simply memos.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During the district meetings, they should not read from them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather they should speak them out as in ordinary speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During the speaking, if they have further inspiration, they should add a few words to them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way, the saints will pick up the boldness in the meetings and will be able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Of course, the most difficult thing to learn in prophesying is to have the spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there is no inspiration, it will become mechanical, and the result will not be a prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For this reason, the prophesying has to be living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother Nee once said that if a speaker can never have instant utterance, his message will never be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A strong message requires instant utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, there is the need for instant inspiration, plus the utterance to express it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, when we speak for the Lord, we have to pay attention to the instant inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>With the inspiration, there is also the need for the utterance to express it.</S>
