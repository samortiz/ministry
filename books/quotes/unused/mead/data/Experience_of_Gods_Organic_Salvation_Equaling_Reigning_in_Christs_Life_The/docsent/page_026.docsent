   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the other things that the worldly people are doing will eventually be vanity and emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only the work which we are carrying out in God s eternal economy is not a vain concept or an empty doctrine or belief; it is practical and substantial.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To live the Body life in a practical and abounding way, first, we need to present our bodies 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We human beings exist in time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we present our bodies, naturally we present our time and offer our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To Be Renewed in Our Mind</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The renewing of the mind is the base for the transformation of our soul; it makes us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To Exercise Our Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 12:4-8 shows us that in the Body of Christ we have received gifts different from one another; there are those who prophesy, those who serve, those who teach, those who exhort, those who give, those who lead, and those who show mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although our gifts are different, we all function according to our respective gifts as normal, proper, rich, organic, functioning members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the Body life is exceptionally abounding and intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 12:9-21 is a long section in which a life of the highest virtues is described.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to live out the highest virtues of Christ in our dealings with others, with God, with ourselves, with the persecutor and enemy, and in general, before all men.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 13:1-7 deals with subjection to authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man is rebellious in his natural character, but a transformed person is submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Apparently, subjection to authorities is related only to the government, but as those who live the normal church life, we should have a proper relationship with the government that we may live the church life in peace and security.</S>
