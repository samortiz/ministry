God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace. You must obey God and at the same time not allow your spirit to go unchecked. You have to be responsible for this matter and never allow your spirit to go unchecked. The outpouring of the Spirit is not for your entertainment. If you do not need it, do not ask for it. There was a brother in Chefoo who received the outpouring of the Spirit. Later, while he was sitting down at a meal, he was about to experience another outpouring. Since he did not need it, however, he rejected it. At another time, he halted the outpouring again while he was riding in a car because there was not the need for it. He is a powerful brother and has saved men whom others cannot save. In principle what he did was right. We should only receive the outpouring of the Spirit when we need it and should not consider it an entertainment or a spiritual enjoyment when we do not need it.</p><p>I believe our first experience of the outpouring is often genuine. However, subsequent experiences of the outpouring are sometimes doubtful. The Bible says that if we being evil still know how to give good gifts to our children, how much more will the Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him (Luke 11:13). If we stand upon this verse and ask the Father, He will surely give us the Holy Spirit. Many people have improper motives before the Lord. They ask for the outpouring of the Spirit out of curiosity or to prove that they are good and spiritual. This leads to the deception of evil spirits. We must be careful and not seek for the outpouring of the Spirit out of curiosity. We should seek because there is the need for it.</p><p>We also have to test the spirit that is upon us. Whenever we experience the outpouring of the Spirit, we have to apply this test. We have to do this every time because we are no match for the evil one in the spiritual realm.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OUTPOURING NOT AS CRUCIAL AS<br />PRAYER AND FAITH</h2><p>In working for the Lord, the outpouring of the Spirit cannot take priority over prayer and faith. We still need prayer and faith in God's work. The outpouring is to empower us, but we cannot use this empowering as a shortcut. We cannot replace prayer and faith with the outpouring of the Spirit. During this conference many people have become very wild. Some think that the wilder they become, the more spiritual they will be. As a result, they bring in many problems. The release of the Spirit begins from our spirit and goes through our soul into our body. It is dangerous for those who have not been dealt with by the cross to receive the outpouring of the Spirit. The first thing one receives after experiencing the outpouring of the Spirit is the power of the Spirit. After this the power of the body and the power of the soul are released as well. This is like underground water which is clean but which becomes contaminated as it passes through different soil layers. Similarly, when there is no dealing of the cross, the spirit becomes impure when it is released through the soul and the body.</p><p>How do we know if the power manifested in us is indeed that coming from the outpouring of the Spirit? We can test this by the cross. The soul-life and physical life must first be subdued by the cross. When the Spirit pours out, spiritual power is released. However, those who have not been dealt with in their soul-life and physical life will discover that all the energy of their spirit, soul, and body will be released at the same time when they experience the outpouring. Consequently, when some people experience a strong outpouring of the Spirit, they find their soulish and physical energy mixed up in the manifestations. One sure test is to ask, "What does a person do when he is freed and no longer under any bondage?" Those whose body has not been dealt with by the cross will jump around uncontrollably when they experience the outpouring of the Spirit. The same can happen to the soul&mdash;those whose souls have not been dealt with will find the latent power of their souls released. I should warn the co-working brothers and sisters that we should be particularly alert for the release of the soul power. Those who are lacking in physical strength will allow their soul power to easily be released. When the Spirit is poured out in a meeting, those who have been dealt with by the cross can discern the ones who are merely releasing their soul power. You can cheat a thousand novices, but you cannot cheat one person who has been dealt with by the cross because he knows the real condition.</p><p>The Bible mentions two kinds of power. One is the resurrection power (Phil. 3:10), which is within man. The other is the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:4), which is outside of man; this is the power that accompanies the outpouring of the Spirit. If one has the power of the Holy Spirit but not the power of resurrection, soulish and physical strength are released along with the Spirit's power. Those who are experienced can readily discern the two streams. This is not what we want to see. We want only one stream&mdash;a spirit that is pure and without mixture.</p><p>We must also know what the resurrection life is. The resurrection life is a "resuscitated" power. Resuscitated power means a power that has passed through death. All of us have our strong natural merits such as our soulish power, our emotion, our ability to make others cry, etc. All of these need to pass through death. Only those who have been dealt with by the cross can render a pure spiritual supply to others in the meetings. The help they give to others is pure, and does not carry any mixture of the soul or the flesh.</p><p>There was a servant of God in China who was a very dear brother. He was very powerful and had saved many people. One day I saw him pouring oil on the heads of thirty to forty people and then hit their faces and kick their bodies. They were eventually healed of their sicknesses. You cannot say that he had an evil spirit. This brother had the power of the outpoured Spirit, but he did not have the inward power of resurrection. As a result, his actions did not match the pattern of the cross. The outpouring of the Spirit gives us power and blessing, and the cross purifies this power. The cross stands in the way of the old creation. With the cross the old creation is halted. Those workers who have passed through the dealing of the cross have the power of resurrection within and the power of the Spirit without. Therefore, even though we are on the subject of the outpouring of the Spirit, we cannot separate this from the truth of the cross which we previously preached. The truth of the cross is very necessary. It will lead us to the way of purity.</p><p>After we return home from this conference, we must first help others to have the overcoming experience and then bring them into the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit. The order cannot be reversed. Without the power of resurrection within, it is very dangerous to have the power of the Spirit without. Before a man receives the outpouring of the Spirit, we have to tell him that he needs to take control of himself and not be wild. We must help others become sober and not be loose. We should only teach others to cooperate with the Holy Spirit. If a man will not cooperate with the Spirit, we would rather teach him more important truths.</p><p>Today I have to confess my mistakes. When we experienced the outpouring of the Spirit, our meeting was too wild. Actually, I did not initiate that meeting; the saints initiated it. I have repeated many times that we must test the spirit every time we receive the outpouring. We cannot be loose in this matter.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 61</div><br></body></html>
