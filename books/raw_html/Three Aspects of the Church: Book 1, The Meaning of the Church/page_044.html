	 <h2 class="head4">Having Two Tenons</h2>
<p>Each board had two tenons (Exo. 36:22). In the Bible the number two signifies testimony. The basic principle of the number two is not being individualistic. Our standing by means of our two feet indicates that we are not individualistic. When a person stands, he uses both of his feet. In the church some brothers and sisters are not steady in their stand because they stand on only one foot; they are individualistic and have no testimony.</p>
<p>There were two tenons for each board and two sockets under the two tenons. These two tenons fit perfectly into the two sockets. This indicates a testimony (vv. 22, 24, 30). If there had been only one tenon matching one socket, there would not have been a testimony. Instead, there were two tenons matching two sockets. Each tenon had to match its respective socket. When both tenons matched their respective sockets, there was the testimony. If each board had only one tenon matching only one socket, then the board could be set up in different ways. With two tenons, however, the board had to be set up in a way so that each tenon matched a particular socket. The board would not have been able to stand if only one tenon matched a socket and the other did not. Both tenons had to match the sockets. This is a testimony. This type implies that a board cannot stand by itself. Every board had two tenons. Similarly, every believer in the church should stand by means of two tenons in two sockets. No action in the church should be individualistic but should require two sockets; it should be testified to by another person. This will ensure a stable standing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Having Bars</h2>
<p>There were horizontal bars crossing and connecting all the standing boards. These bars served as connecting bands (vv. 31-34). Hence, the bars signify the oneness of the Spirit (cf. Eph. 4:3). Originally the boards were separate, but with the addition of the bars, the boards became one. This is the same in the church. The brothers and sisters start out as individuals, but by the Holy Spirit operating as the bars within them, they become one.</p>
<p>The boards had golden rings to hold the bars (Exo. 36:34). The golden rings may be compared to the nose-ring put upon Rebekah&rsquo;s nose (Gen. 24:47). The ability of the boards to stand depended upon the acacia wood, whereas their being connected together depended upon the golden rings. The Holy Spirit unites us together by the divine life, which entered into us on the day of our salvation. The golden ring typifies the divine life. Therefore, the oneness of the church is altogether in the Holy Spirit and in the divine life.</p>
<p>The oneness of the church cannot be found in man. In man there is only separation and dispersion. The oneness of the church is altogether in God. In the tabernacle the golden rings, not the wood of the boards, were used to join the boards together to form a wall. The many independent and separate boards were united by the golden rings. The boards by themselves could never be united with one another. The boards were linked together as a wall because golden rings were holding the bars. The boards of the tabernacle signify the saints in the church. All the saints have both humanity and divinity. In our humanity we have no way to be joined together, but in divinity we can be joined together as one. Thus, if we live only in our humanity, we will be separated and scattered, but if we live in the divine life, we will be one. The oneness of the church is altogether in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit who descended on the day of Pentecost possesses humanity. Hence, the bars were gold without and wood within. This matter is very mysterious, but this truth was made clear at the time of Andrew Murray. In the Old Testament, God was merely God, having nothing to do with humanity. Hence, His Spirit possessed only divinity. However, through incarnation, divinity entered into humanity, and through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, humanity entered into resurrection and was brought into divinity. Christ became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b), and on the day of Pentecost the Spirit who came to earth possessed not only divinity but also humanity.</p>
<p>John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified. At that time the Spirit of God existed, but &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo;  was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified in His resurrection. The title <em>the Holy Spirit</em> was not used before the incarnation, because divinity had not yet been brought into humanity. Similarly, the title <em>the Spirit</em> was not used before the glorification of Jesus, because humanity had not yet been brought into divinity. Thus, the term <em>the Spirit</em> refers to the Spirit of God who now possesses humanity in resurrection. Today we are able to fellowship with the Lord because we are in &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; This is very deep in significance. It is the Spirit who causes all the saints in the church to be one.</p>
