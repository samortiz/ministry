<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESENT EXPERIENCE OF RESURRECTION</H2><P>Other verses prove that the out-resurrection spoken of in Philippians 3:11 is not merely a future event, but a present process. Romans 6:4 and 5 say that as we have been buried in the likeness of Christ's death, so we shall also walk in the newness of life. This means that we shall be resurrected in the likeness of His resurrection. This likeness is the newness of life.</P><P>Romans 8:10 and 11 say that we have Christ within us, that our body is dead because of sin, but that our spirit is life because of righteousness. Furthermore, the Spirit who raised up Christ from among the dead will give life to our mortal body so that our body may enjoy resurrection life. This is not only a future matter; it is the process of resurrection that we are undergoing today.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 1:8 and 9 Paul said that he was pressed out of measure, beyond strength, and even despaired of life; he also said that he had the sentence of death upon him. Nevertheless, the God who raises the dead sustained him by the power of resurrection. In 2 Corinthians 4:10 Paul said that he was always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in his body (Gk.). In verse 16 of the same chapter he said that the outward man is being consumed but the inward man is being renewed day by day. This is the process of the resurrection. We will continue in this process until we arrive at the goal of the out-resurrection. This is the way to experience Christ.</P><P>This word must not be mere doctrine to us; it is something that we need to practice in our daily living. In whatever we do we should ask whether or not we are being conformed to the death of Christ. We need to be conformed to His death so that by any means we may arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead. This is the only way for the Lord to go on in His recovery, the only way for the Lord to build up His church, the only way for Him to prepare His Bride, and the only way for us to bring the Lord back. The unique way is to be conformed to the death of Christ so that we may attain unto the out-resurrection from among the dead.</P>
