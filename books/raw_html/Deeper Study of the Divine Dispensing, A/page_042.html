<h2 class=head1>BEING THE DIVINE DISPENSING AS THE WISDOM FROM GOD TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:24 also tells us that the crucified Christ is the wisdom of God. Through Christ’s incarnation and crucifixion, God removed man’s sins and annulled Satan, the one who corrupted man, thus releasing the divine life and making it available to all those who believe in Him. This is God’s wisdom. This wisdom is full of counsel, affording the saints the strategies. In the church life today, as long as we have Christ as our wisdom from God, all the problems will no longer continue to be problems.<h2 class=head1>BEING THE DIVINE DISPENSING AS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM GOD TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>Christ as the righteousness from God to us (1 Cor. 1:30) is not only for justification concerning our past offenses, but is for our living today. It enables us to be right and just toward God, man, and everything else in procedures and methods. Christ is dispensed from God into us to be our life, power, and wisdom, so that we can live out this righteous living and be righteous in every word, deed, movement, and action.<h2 class=head1>BEING THE DIVINE DISPENSING AS THE SANCTIFICATION FROM GOD TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>Christ as the sanctification from God to us (1 Cor. 1:30) is not only sanctifying us in position, but in disposition also, so that we can be set apart to God from everything common. He is the power of our sanctification, and He is also the factor for our sanctification. Through Him, the divine dispensing is continually transmitted into us, sanctifying our whole being—spirit, soul, and body—making us holy, full of the divine element to live out an excelling living.<h2 class=head1>BEING THE DIVINE DISPENSING AS THE REDEMPTION FROM GOD TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>Finally, Christ as the redemption from God to us (1 Cor. 1:30) will transfigure our body through His divine life, so that we will have the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). Here we need to realize that everything that God glorifies has to be redeemed by passing through the judgment of the cross. First, there is redemption, then glory. More or less, every one of us is still in the old creation and in the natural life. For this reason, we need to take the judgment of the cross in order that we can receive Christ as our redemption and can be qualified to enjoy God’s glory. This is not only for the believers’ living today, but for the redemption of their bodies in the future, so that their whole being can enter into God’s glory and can express God’s glory and radiance forever.<p>Today, in the church life, every day we need the all-inclusive Christ to be our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. All the divine riches of Christ are being continually dispensed from God into us. The more He is dispensed into us, the more the divine element within us increases, so that eventually our whole being is supplied and sustained by Him.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Kuching, Malaysia on October 31, 1990)
