   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING CHRIST, THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you read this word, you may feel that you are not able to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No, we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we need to pay attention to Paul s word in Philippians 3:10: To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. Here we see that Paul desired to know three things: Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Him in Philippians 3:10 is the Me in Matthew 16:24.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not able to deny ourselves and go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But by the power of Christ s resurrection, we can do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, through His resurrection, we can enter into the fellowship of His sufferings and be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although in ourselves we cannot do this, we have One living within us who can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WORKING OUT OUR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Philippians 2:12 Paul says, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament the word salvation is used in various ways.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regarding our eternal salvation, we cannot work anything out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus has done everything to accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we do need to work out the salvation that enables us to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the building of the church, we need to work out this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire book of Philippians is a book on the building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among the Philippians there was division and the lack of building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the Apostle Paul wrote this Epistle to help them to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul was telling them to work out the building, for this building was their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians today are missing the building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that they are not working out their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose you are living in the brothers house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you first moved in, you thought living with the brothers would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, after a short period of time, you found that you could not get along with certain brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is nothing you should do about this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, remain in that brothers house to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although you cannot suffer this killing, there is One in you who can.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You simply need to follow Him to work out your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD WORKING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Philippians 2:13 tells us how to work out our salvation: For it is God which worketh in you both the willing and the working for his good pleasure Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>. God is in us doing this work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We simply need to exercise the key of self-denial and say amen to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to exercise the key to lock the self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we all learn this lesson, we shall be built up together, and we shall become a strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We shall be able to testify that although we have different characters, dispositions, temperaments, and backgrounds, we can be one and can be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is precisely what the Lord is dealing with in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>LOCKING UP THE SELF FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 16 has been veiled for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps you have read this chapter again and again and again without knowing what the Lord was really saying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But now the Lord has given us further understanding to see how the church can be built up through the exercise of the keys.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to be afraid of ourselves and use the key to lock up ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should do this not only in the church life, but also in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you exercise the key to lock the self, you will have no problems in your marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the problems are from Satan who comes out through the gate of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When this gate is locked, Satan is confined, and there are no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these messages I am not concerned with mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, I am presenting to you what I have learned through years of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to find out how the church can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you say that the church is built up through the cross and the resurrection, that is still too doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to go on to learn to exercise the key of self-denial to lock up the self in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether a situation is for you or against you, you must lock up the self.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether the brothers love you and welcome you or hate you and do not welcome you, you still need to lock your self.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do this, there will be no problems, and it will be possible to have the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But without the locking up of the self, there is no possibility of having the building.</S>
