   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE RECOVERY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTRY Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 10, 1948, 9:00 a.m.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai CONCERNING THE TRUTH Not Arranging the Sequence of Truth</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>according to One's Personal Experience</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Questions: Do we first know the individual life and then the Body life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is the basis of the Body life the individual life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is individualism a hindrance to the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee: At the time of the Reformation, Luther emphasized justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was, of course, a recovery of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, at that time men only saw that faith before God is needed, rather than work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luther was supposed to have recovered the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, he only emphasized faith; he did not fully realize what justification is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was not until men like J. N. Darby were raised up in the last century that justification was covered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though the word "justification'' was used, they had not touched the reality of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They did not know what, in fact, is justification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In spite of this, they spoke much on the truth of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the last century some people also began to talk about the doctrine of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what is the relationship between regeneration and justification?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is difficult to say which one comes first and which one comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was a brother who once preached the doctrine of justification unceasingly; he had never heard of the doctrine of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After three years he began to hear about the doctrine of regeneration, and he realized that he was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From that time on, whenever he preached the gospel, he would always tell others that a man is justified and then regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only was he preaching this, but all the people around him began to preach the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, for a person to say that justification always comes first and then regeneration is making too definite and too subjective a distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A person who has no experience cannot preach God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But a person who only trusts in his experience cannot preach God's word either.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A person who preaches God's word must be free from the limitation of his own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible for a person to experience certain truths according to a certain sequence in time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But he must never think that the order of the truths is necessarily according to the way he experiences them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Two Sides of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are two sides to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times, some doctrines only cover one side of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, we know that there are two aspects to the result of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, it removes our sins Col 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, it justifies us Rom 8:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we cannot say that the cross is clearly divided into these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are actually two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are actually justified from sin through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We who are dead have been freed from sin and justified from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This does not mean that being delivered from sin is one thing and being free is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither does it mean that being delivered from sin is one thing and justification is another thing.</S>
