   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through their faith in the Son of God and the overcoming life in them, believers can live a life that overcomes the world 1 John 5:4-5 , the evil one 2:13-14 , antichrist 4:3-4 , and all the fallen situations of the degraded church Rev 2:4, 6, 13-15, 20, 24; 3:1, 15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though the enemy s attack and corruption brought in the church s decline, the Lord continually sounds out the call to the church to overcome during this time of the church s degradation and desolation.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the prophecies in the New Testament, the overcomers will be rewarded by the Lord in the kingdom age.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The crown of righteousness and the righteous Judge in this verse show that in contrast to salvation, which is of grace and by faith Eph 2:5, 8-9 , receiving the prize is of righteousness through works Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This glory will be the overcomers enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and of Christ 2 Pet 1:11 .</S>
