[1]  OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31-32, 36-37; Zech 4:2, 10b; Rev 1:12-13, 20; 4:5b; 5:6; 1:4
[2]  In this book, we will specifically consider the golden lampstand in the Bible.
[3]  Apparently, the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation written by John are unrelated to the book of Exodus in the Old Testament; or we may say that it is difficult to find the relationship between them.
[4]  In John 1 there is one behold : Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! v. 29 , and in Revelation 21 there is another behold : Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men v. 3 . In Exodus there are the lamb and the tabernacle, and the lamb is for the tabernacle.
[5]  There the apostle John said, When I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands v. 12 . To see what the lampstands are, we again need to turn to the classics.
[6]  Today, however, I clearly see that the lampstands in the New Testament are exactly the same as the lampstand in the Old Testament; they also consist of one stand with seven lamps each, and these seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God.
[7]  Revelation says that the Spirit of God as the seven Spirits is not only the seven eyes of God but also the seven eyes of the Lamb.
[8]  FOR THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31-32, 37; Zech 3:9; 4:2-10; Rev 1:4, 11-13, 20; 4:5; 5:6 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REVELATION
[9]  According to God s eternal desire, economy, or plan, the golden lampstand is not merely Christ or merely Christ with the Spirit; instead, the golden lampstand is Christ with the Spirit producing the church.
[10]  If there is Christ yet not the Spirit, God cannot carry out His plan; if there is Christ with the Spirit yet without the church, God has not yet reached the ultimate goal of His economy.
[11]  Today we must see the church, and we must also see Christ walking in the midst of the churches.
[12]  Many of us can testify that when we were in the denominations, we did not see much of Christ, nor did we enjoy much of Christ, but since we have come into the church in the Lord s recovery, we definitely see the Son of Man walking in the midst of the local churches.
[13]  As to those who say, We want Christ but not the church, the more they speak, the emptier they become.
[14]  In the church we say, We want the church!
[15]  This tells us that the lampstand is Jehovah, that Jehovah is the Lamb, that the seven lamps on the lampstand are the seven eyes of Jehovah, and that the seven eyes of Jehovah are the seven eyes of the Lamb.
[16]  The seven lamps are the seven eyes, the seven eyes are the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits are the seven lamps.
[17]  Furthermore, how can the lamps be the eyes, the eyes be the Spirits, and the Spirits be the lamps?
[18]  FOR GOD S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Zech 3:9; 4:7; Acts 4:10-12; John 1:42; Matt 16:18; 1 Pet 2:4-5; 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:11, 18-19a THE CHURCH BEING THE REPRINT
[19]  I hope that every one of us can have a clear vision of the church being the reprint of the Spirit with Christ.
[20]  The Lord s recovery today is the recovery of the church as the reprint of the Spirit with Christ.
[21]  This does not depend on having a big number or a small number of people; rather, it depends on having some saints who meet together in the Lord s name, in the Lord s person, as Christ s reprint, Christ s reproduction.
[22]  Christ is one and the Spirit is one, but the Spirit with Christ wants to reprint Christ onto the church.
[23]  Let us forget about the theologians and come back to the Bible.
[24]  The Bible says that this lampstand is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Lamb, the Lamb is the stone, and the stone is God.
[25]  Dear brothers and sisters, we must see these matters clearly if we want to know the church.
[26]  In Matthew 21:42 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that the stone which they rejected was made by God to be the cornerstone.
[27]  In Acts 4:10-12, after the Lord s resurrection, Peter preached the gospel to the Jews, telling them that they needed to know that Jesus Christ, the Nazarene whom they crucified, had been raised from the dead and that the stone which they, the builders, rejected had been made the cornerstone by God.
[28]  In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul said that we should build upon Christ as the foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones.
[29]  He speaks not merely of stones but of precious stones.
[30]  If we would have a thorough understanding of the church, we have to realize that the church involves the Triune God, God s relationship with man, Christ s redemption, and God s building.
[31]  They do not have the thorough light from God to see that the church is entirely a matter of the golden lampstand.
[32]  Outside of the realm of God s presence, we have sunlight and moonlight, and we have the natural view, but we can never have the view of God s economy and administration.
[33]  This means that the shining of the church is in the church.
[34]  Outside of the church is the natural view, but not the light of revelation which shines out of God s lampstand.
[35]  This is because they are not in the Holy Place; they are not before the throne of God, and they are not under the shining of the seven lamps.
[36]  In contrast, many can testify that as soon as they stepped into the church meetings, the light was shining, they became clear, and they had the realization not of wearing fabric shoes versus leather ones, but of God s administration, God s economy.
[37]  Today, not only ordinary Christians, but even many pastors, preachers, and professors in Bible seminaries do not know what human life actually is, and they are even more unskilled concerning God s administration, God s economy.
[38]  Nevertheless, forgive me to say that sometimes, in certain local churches, the light is not bright.
[39]  It is not that there is no light, but that there is only a small amount of light.
[40]  In 1 Samuel 3, when Samuel ministered to Jehovah as a child before Eli, the lamp of God had not yet gone out v. 3 . This means that the lamp was about to go out because old Eli the priest was too weak.
[41]  Whether or not the lamps of a local church are bright is absolutely related to the priests burning of incense before God.
[42]  You must brighten up the light of the lamps in the local church so that when people come to the church, they will feel that it is full of light and that it is impossible for them to hide anything.
[43]  Each local church should be so bright that once people enter in, all their situations are fully exposed so that they cannot help saying, God is indeed among you, because my secrets have been thoroughly revealed under the shining of your light.
[44]  We must see, and we must be clear and realize, that this conference is the shining of the great light, and this shining is God s move, God s administration.
[45]  THE SEVEN LAMPS OF FIRE BEING FOR GOD S MOVE
[46]  Now we would like to consider the shining of the seven lamps.
[47]  This is a driving burden within me, and I hope that I can stir you up!
[48]  Perhaps when some hear this word, they may remind me that when I was among you six or seven years ago, I said that the lamps of fire are for burning and illumining us that we may be burning.
[49]  Lightnings, voices, and thunders come forth out of the throne, and before the throne are seven burning lamps of fire for impelling us.
[50]  Dear brothers and sisters, today in the church the seven lamps of fire are burning not only to shine on us and to burn us, but even more to motivate us.
[51]  FOR TRANSFUSION Scripture Reading: Zech 4:10; 2 Chron 16:9a; Rev 5:6; 4:5; Psa 33:18; 32:8 THE SEVEN LAMPS ENLIGHTENING AND BURNING
[52]  In the previous message, we saw that the seven lamps of the golden lampstand ultimately become the seven lamps of fire.
[53]  Lamps are usually shining but not burning; however, when we come to Revelation, the seven lamps on the lampstands are not only brightly shining but also burning.
[54]  In Exodus, the seven lamps enlightened in the darkness so that the priests who served God could move in the realm of God s presence, that is, in the Holy Place.
[55]  They are not only shining lamps but also fiery lamps burning lamps of fire, lamps burning with fire.
[56]  We also know that this Lamb is the stone which was engraved by God, and that in one day this engraving removed all the iniquity of God s people.
[57]  I can testify that anyone who has gone through God s burning, judging, and purifying, and whose grass bags have been burned away by God, can say, O God!
[58]  Every time we meet together, we allow God to transfuse Himself into us.
[59]  However, when we come to the church meetings, we feel that we are sitting before the Lord and that His eyes are looking at us.
[60]  Second Chronicles 16:9 says, The eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout all the earth.
[61]  Today God s eyes are running to and fro, seeking those whose heart is perfect towards Him.
[62]  In the same way, after we have been in the church for a long period of time, what God is, what the Lord is, is gradually infused into us.
[63]  BECOMING THE FLOWING RIVERS Scripture Reading: Exo 17:5-6; 1 Cor 10:1-4; John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 22:1, 17; 2:1, 7a; 21:23 JOHN S WRITINGS AND THE BOOK OF EXODUS
[64]  In Exodus there is the lampstand, a crucial item in the tabernacle related to the administration of God and the actions of those who serve God, and in John s writings, the churches are called the lampstands.
[65]  The Nicene Creed speaks of the Triune God, referring to the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit, but not one word is said about the Holy Spirit being the life-giving Spirit.
[66]  Exodus refers to the flowing of the living water, and John s writings also speak of the flowing of the living water, but there is a difference.
[67]  In Exodus we cannot see the seven burning lamps of fire, but in the record in Revelation there are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne.
[68]  Actually, they are a great fire burning to execute God s judgment and carry out God s work.
[69]  When we first came into the church, we sensed that there was light here, and we sensed the shining of the light.
[70]  If we continue to remain in the church and allow this light to shine on us and this fire to burn us, after such constant shining and burning, the fire turns into the water of life flowing in us.
[71]  When we were without the shining, we felt that we were not bad and that no one was as perfect as we were, but after we came into the church and entered into the light, right away our true condition was completely exposed.
[72]  THERE BEING ONLY A RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE
[73]  The Spirit never fails to flow after He burns in us; His flowing always follows His burning.
[74]  Whether there is more burning after the flowing depends on whether there is anything more in us that needs burning.
[75]  At the beginning of Revelation, the Lamb has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits are the burning lamps, but at the end of Revelation, the lamp is the Lamb.
