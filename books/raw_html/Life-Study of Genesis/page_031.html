<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. FOR SIGNS&#151;MAINLY FOR MOVEMENT</H2><P>The sun, moon, and stars are signs. These signs are mainly for movement. In the ancient time, sailors navigated according to the stars. Today, we drive our cars according to traffic signs. Thus, signs are for movement.</P><P>The Pharisees and the Sadducees came to the Lord Jesus, asking Him to show them a sign from heaven (Matt. 16:1-4). The Lord said, "Foolish people, you know the signs of the sky. When the sky is red in the evening, you say that the weather will be fine. When the morning sky is red and lowering, you say the weather will be stormy. You know the signs in the sky, but you don't know the signs of this time. I am the sign&#151;I am just like Jonah. You don't see the sign because you don't have the light." The disciples also came to the Lord on the mount of Olives and asked Him about the sign of His coming, the sign of the end of this age (Matt. 24:3).</P><P>We not only have these verses, but also a great sign in the universe found in Revelation 12:1&#151;the sign of a woman with the sun, the moon, and the stars. In order to move properly in this universe, we have this woman as a great sign. This woman is something related to the church. I do not say that the woman is the church, but that the church is a great part of this woman. If we are to move and behave and act in this universe, we must know this woman.</P><P>She originates in Genesis 3. The Bible is a book of women. Satan entered the human race through a woman, and the Lord Jesus also entered the human race through a woman. Eventually, the Bible consummates with the New Jerusalem, which is a female, the bride of Christ. Hallelujah! We will all be a part of that woman. So, we all must know the woman in Revelation 12. She is a biblical woman, a universal woman covering the whole Bible. Strictly speaking, she began in Genesis 2 with Eve, not in Genesis 3, and then proceeds from Genesis 2 to Revelation 22. If you know this woman, you know the signs. She is a very prominent sign. She is a sign for God's people to know whether they must go on or stop. Because many Christians lack this woman, they don't know what to do. They have no way to go on. We need a sign, a sign which comes from the fourth-day lights.</P>
