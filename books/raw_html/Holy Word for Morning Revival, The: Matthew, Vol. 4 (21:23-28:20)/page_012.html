<p class="bold">WEEK 17 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 24:27-31</h2><p class="bold">27 &nbsp;For just as the <sup>1</sup>lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</p><p>28 &nbsp;Wherever the <sup>1</sup>corpse is, there will the <sup>1</sup>vultures be gathered together.</p><p>29 &nbsp;And immediately <sup>1</sup>after the tribulation of those days, the <sup>2</sup>sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</p><p class="bold">30 &nbsp;And at that time the <sup>1</sup>sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the <sup>2</sup>tribes of the <sup>2</sup>land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming <sup>3</sup>on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p><p class="bold">31 &nbsp;And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will <sup>1</sup>gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>27<sup>1</sup> The second coming of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect, related to His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect, related to the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles. The lightning here signifies the open aspect, which will take place after the great tribulation (vv. 29-30), whereas the thief’s coming in v. 43 signifies the secret aspect, which will occur before the great tribulation. Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth. Hence, the Lord’s coming like a flash of lightning will be a sign of the end of the Lord’s parousia (see note 3<sup>3</sup>). This implies also that the Lord is like electricity.</p><p>28<sup>1</sup> Taken in context, vv. 15 and 21 imply that at the end of this age Antichrist will be the cause of the great tribulation. It is he who will need to be judged and destroyed. All people in Adam are dead (1 Cor. 15:22); thus, the evil Antichrist, who with his evil armies will war against the Lord at Armageddon (Rev. 19:17-21), is in the eyes of the Lord a stinking corpse, good for the vultures’ appetite. Furthermore, in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to an eagle (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Isa. 40:31), and the swift, destroying armies are likened to flying eagles (Deut. 28:49; Hosea 8:1). Hence, the vultures here, being predatory birds of the eagle kind, refer undoubtedly to Christ and His overcomers, who will come as a swift, flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them at Armageddon, thus executing God’s judgment upon them.…</p><p>29<sup>1</sup> This is strong proof that the open coming of Christ will take place after the great tribulation (v. 21).</p><p>29<sup>2</sup> This supernatural calamity will occur in heaven after the great tribulation, at the close of the end of this age (see note 12<sup>2</sup> in Rev. 6). This differs from the calamities of the sixth seal and the fourth trumpet (Rev. 6:12-13; 8:12), which will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation.</p><p>30<sup>1</sup> We have no way of knowing what this sign is. However, it must be supernatural and clearly visible (perhaps like the lightning in v. 27), appearing in heaven.</p><p>30<sup>2</sup> The tribes here are the tribes of the nation of Israel, and the land is the Holy Land. At the Lord’s appearing, all the tribes of Israel will repent and mourn (Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7).<p>30<sup>3</sup> By this time the Lord will no longer be in the cloud but on the cloud, appearing to the people on earth. This is the open aspect of His second coming. See note 1<sup>2</sup> in Rev. 10 and note 14<sup>1</sup> in Rev. 14.</p><p>31<sup>1</sup> After the great tribulation, at His coming back to earth, the Lord will gather together to the Holy Land the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth. This will be the fulfillment not only of the Lord’s word in 23:37 but also of God’s promise in the Old Testament (see reference 31<sup>a</sup>).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 727-731; Hymns: #124, #888</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
