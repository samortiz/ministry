<p>The outstanding characteristic of a person who has been dealt with and broken is that he does not have many opinions, nor does he like to express his opinions. The desire to express one&rsquo;s opinions is a sign of a lack of dealing. For example, a stone that has not been cut has many sharp edges, indentations, and protrusions. Some brothers bring their opinions with them when they serve in the church. They are like stones with many sharp edges; hence, no one can touch them. A stone that has been cut and worked on is smooth and does not have sharp edges. Some brothers have been dealt with by God and therefore do not express their opinions when they serve. This does not mean that we should be closed and keep our opinions to ourselves by not expressing them. We cannot pretend. We may be able to temporarily hide our opinions, but one day they will be expressed. We need to be dealt with in God&rsquo;s hand. Only those who have been dealt with by God do not have opinions.</p>
<p>The more lessons we have learned in the Lord and the deeper we are in Him, the fewer opinions we will have when we serve. It will not matter whether we clean the benches with a dry cloth or a wet one, nor will it matter whether we do it in the morning or in the evening. Those who have learned lessons and been dealt with do not have opinions about such things. However, when a matter is related to God&rsquo;s interest, they have a proper measure. They can maintain and protect God&rsquo;s testimony because they are stones that have been properly measured and cut. The measure of God that is with them is according to the pattern shown in the mountain (Exo. 25:40; 26:30). In contrast, some saints are so contentious over matters such as cleaning benches that they even stop serving. Such saints are weak and shrink back, and they easily give in to the enemy in matters related to God&rsquo;s interest. This is evidence that they lack a proper measure because they have not been broken and dealt with by God.</p>
<p>This situation is rather common in the churches. We have received God&rsquo;s grace, and we are willing to serve Him and please Him, but we often have different opinions, even over small matters. As a result, we lack the oneness, are not in harmony, and cannot be fitly joined or firmly knit together. We must keep in mind that the Holy Spirit leaves when we argue. In the Bible the Holy Spirit is typified by a dove (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32). A dove is very sensitive and easily frightened. If we are gentle, it will come to us, but as soon as we are somewhat violent, it will fly away. When we insist on our ideas, the Holy Spirit will leave. Brother A may win an argument, but Brother B will not say Amen within. Not only so, the other saints will perceive the argument, and as a result, their spirit will be affected. Furthermore, Brother A will not be able to touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and the saints will not be edified.</p>
<p>Many years ago in the church in Shanghai a newly saved brother saw two elders discussing a certain matter. The younger elder suggested a way that was cumbersome, but surprisingly the other elder joyfully accepted the suggestion. Later, the new brother testified that he was edified in the first meeting he attended when he saw the building among the elders. He said that there was a harmony among the elders that did not exist among people in the world. That picture was etched in his heart. Hence, even a small matter can greatly edify people.</p>
<p>A person who has been dealt with will refrain from arguing not only when he is wrong but even when he is right. We must let the Lord break us to the extent that we can refrain from arguing even when we are the only person who is right. Very few disputes among us in the past were concerning God&rsquo;s testimony. Most of the disputes and discord among us were related to minor things. Even if a dispute seems to be related to an important matter, we still should not argue, because by arguing we will lose the taste of sweetness, and we will lose the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The sense of harmony in the spirit of the saints is delicate and tender. Therefore, whenever there is an argument, we will lose the sense of harmony in our spirit. We need to keep the harmony in our spirit and not damage it. It takes only a slight discord for us to lose the harmony in our spirit. Even if we win an argument, God&rsquo;s presence will not be in our actions. Only when there is harmony in the spirit of the saints will God&rsquo;s presence and blessing be with us.</p>
<p>Hence, it does not matter whether our reasoning is right or wrong. When there is harmony and God&rsquo;s presence, we are right. Without harmony and God&rsquo;s presence, whatever seems right is wrong. His presence is what matters in our service. This is the tree of life, not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In everything that we do, including our service, we should not be concerned about methods; we should be concerned only with how to have God&rsquo;s presence. We should take care of a matter in such a way that the harmony in the spirit of the saints is not damaged but rather upheld. Our experience testifies that a person who is broken and dealt with does not express his opinions but brings in harmony.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
