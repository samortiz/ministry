   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>PART 3</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we want to see the remaining items which are consummated in the book of Revelation, which is itself a book of consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must remember that only the items which are related either indirectly or directly to Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church are consummated in this book.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning this universal woman, it is necessary to study the positive females in the Old Testament beginning from Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Females such as Sarah and Rebecca should be included in your study.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Also, even in the Old Testament God considered His chosen people as a female and furthermore as His counterpart, His wife Isa 54:5; 62:5; Jer 2:2; 3:1, 14; 31:32; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>16:8; 23:5; Hosea 2:7, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This universal woman in Revelation 12 is a universal composition of all God s redeemed people, who have been portrayed as females.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaiah 7:14 is another Old Testament passage alluding to this universal woman: Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament, of course, the church is considered as a female, as the wife of Christ Eph 5:23-25 , as a pure virgin to Christ 2 Cor 11:2 , and even the believers themselves are considered as virgins Rev 14:4; S. S. 1:3 . All this needs our study.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then you have a consummation in this universal woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seed of this woman, the manchild, also needs our study.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15, the seed of Abraham Gal 3:16 , the seed of David Rom 1:3 , and the seed of the virgin Mary are items which need to be included in our study.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This manchild in Revelation 12 represents the stronger part of God s chosen people.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Genesis 3, Satan was a serpent, a smaller creature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here in Revelation 12 he has become a dragon, much greater than a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, he is called a great red dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Red here signifies the shedding of blood caused by Satan s murders John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Beasts</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Revelation 13:1-2 is the coming beast out of the sea, signifying the coming Caesar of the coming Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the consummation of the four beasts in Daniel 7.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This last beast in Revelation 13 is the ultimate one, the greatest one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Also, in Revelation 13 is another beast out of the earth who had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon v. 11 . This is the false prophet who is the consummation of all the false prophets.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Revelation 14:4 is the firstfruit, signifying the living overcomers among God s living people and in 14:15 is the harvest, signifying God s living people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To fully understand this consummation it is necessary to study Leviticus 23:9-14, a record of the feast of the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The harvest is also recorded in Leviticus 23:15-22.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Pentecost was the fulfillment of the feast of weeks Deut 16:10 , which was also called the feast of harvest Exo 23:16 , counting from the day of offering a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath Lev 23:10-11, 15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This harvest affords God s people the way to have a feast of tabernacles Lev 23:33-44 .</S>
