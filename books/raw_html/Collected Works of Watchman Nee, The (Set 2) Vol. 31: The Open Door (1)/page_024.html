<h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I sent out all the copies of The Open Door the day before yesterday. With the exception of those bound for Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Shanghai, and Kiangsu, which I have given to Mr. Nee with the mailing list to be sent out from Hong Kong, the rest have all been sent out from Hankow. Chefoo, Peking, Tientsin, Tsinan, and regions in Chekiang are not in the war-zone, and I have mailed the magazine to them directly from here. Brother Chang will leave for the southwestern part of the country within a week. Brother Yuen left for Kwangchow the night before last. I heard that he will not return to Hankow for another few months. I will write more later.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />December 24<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Southeast Asia</h2><p>My beloved sister in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter dated August 30 and the Shanghai local newsletter yesterday. My heart was truly rejoicing in the faithfulness of the Lord. Since the news came about the war in Shanghai, I have been praying earnestly before the Lord that He would preserve His children in Shanghai, northern China, and along the coast just as He has preserved His chosen people in the past. Sometimes I felt that the Lord touched me to fast and pray. Thank Him that every time I went to Him and committed you to Him, my heart was at peace. It is a pity that there will be so many refugees wandering in tribulation. It would be wonderful if some could seize the opportunity to preach the gospel to them.</p><p>Recently, I have felt that the Lord's coming will not be delayed. I have been considering my future, whether I should drop my teaching job to serve Him full-time or serve Him the same way I am doing. Of course, the best way is to walk according to the Lord's will. Please pray for this. Southeast Asia, like all other places, has the need for workers to go forth to be thrust into the harvest. Sister Fang Chiung-ying desires to come here, but she must have a job before she can have an entry permit. If she applies for a tourist visa (which is good only for six months), it will be much easier. If anyone wants to work, he or she must have another co-worker to work together with him or her. Because of the war, the price of rubber here dropped by fifty percent during the first half of the year. The school has announced that the New Year recess will start on December 15. The Lord willing, by then I will go to Sarawak (the capital) to preach the gospel. That place is very dark. I have indeed worked less this term than last term, but the school owes me quite a sum of salary. Please give my greetings to Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and many sisters whom I know (Isa. 41:10, 13; 28:16; 26:12; 12:2-3). The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Sister Hwang Bi-gwe<br />Evening, October 14<br />[Address omitted]</p>
